      This forthright documentary presented the rapid rise and tragic fall of
          British singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse. Plagued by her heavy abuse
          of drugs (crack cocaine and heroin) and alcohol and her troubled relationships,
          her life was taken early in July of 2011 due to alcohol poisoning at
          the age of 27. She struggled with alcohol use even when she was a young
          teen. Her career took off in the mid-2000s with the release of her
          only two albums: Frank (2003) and Back to Black
          (2006). The textured film - with many excerpts of her singing style
          and voice - pieced together interviews, performance shoots, outtakes,
          and previously unseen footage of the young, gifted and talented rising
          star. It ended with Winehouse's funeral and a final video tribute to
          her. </font></p></td>

          (2015)</b>, 90 minutes, D: Charlie Kaufman &amp; Duke
      Johnson</font><br />
        <font size="2">Co-director and adapted screenwriter Charlie Kaufman based
        this stop-motion animated film upon his own 2005 audio
        play <i>Anomalisa</i>, written under the pseudonym Francis Fregoli. [Note:
        Fregoli referred to a rare psychological disorder that caused a person
        to inaccurately believe that different people were in fact a single person.]
        Set in the year 2005, this bizarrely-dramatic, mind-blowing film about
        a personal existential crisis followed lonely author, customer service
        expert and motivational speaker Michael Stone (voice of David Thewlis)
        who suffered from Fregoli disorder. After publishing his latest self-help
        book, &quot;How May I Help You Help Them?&quot;, he traveled on a business
        trip to Cincinnati, OH to promote his book and speak about customer service
        at a convention in the Fregoli Hotel. He was melancholy (feeling negative
        about life), delusional, unmotivated and dissociated from life due to
        his disorder. He perceived the world as one of mundane repetitiveness,
        and it appeared to him that everyone's voice (voice of Tom Noonan) sounded
        the same, until he heard the voice of Lisa Hesselman (voice of Jennifer
        Jason Leigh) in the hallway. She was revealed to be a unique, extraordinary
        and insecure female who had come from Akron, OH to hear his talk. After
        she called herself an anomaly, he nicknamed her &quot;Anomalisa&quot; - and they
        had an intimate sexual encounter. His next struggle was to keep her magical
        nature from becoming bland like everyone else, to prevent
        others from curtailing their relationship, and to keep himself from reverting
        to his old disconnected self. </font></p></td>

        Joss Whedon<br />
        The   11th film in the <a href="superheroes-marvel.html"><i>Marvel Cinematic
        Universe (MCU)</i></a>. In this action-filled, ensemble superhero sequel
        to Marvel's <i>The Avengers (2012)</i>, the Avengers teamed up to combat a sentient
        being known as Ultron (voice of James Spader), an artificial intelligence
        obsessed with a mission to eradicate humanity to save Earth. The Avengers
        in the comic-book-styled film included Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert
        Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo),
        Steve Rogers / Captain America (Chris Evans), Clint Barton / Hawkeye
        (Jeremy Renner), and Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson).
        It was an ironic fact that Ultron had been designed as a peace-keeping
        program, but the robotic android took its directives to the extreme with
        the belief that the only means to attain world peace was to homicidally
        exterminate all human beings. Two allies joining Ultron were super-powered
        twin siblings: Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) with
        super-human speed, and Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen)
        with telekinetic and hypnotic powers.</font></p></td>

          Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,&quot; this semi-biographical docu-drama
          surveyed the financial strategies of various players during the 2000s
          when they bet against the stock market and the housing market by creating
          the credit default swap market. They accurately forecast the collapse
          of high-risk subprime loans (residential mortgages) because of excessive
          lending practices. By predicting that the markets would inevitably
          crash, investors bet against, or shorted, market-based mortgage-backed
          securities, for a profit. The risk-taking investors included: Scion
          Capital hedge fund manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale), Mark Baum
          (Steve Carell) - the head of a trading firm known as FrontPoint Partners,
          Deutsche Bank executive trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), and retired
          ex-securities trader Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), who took advantage of
          corruption, fraud and dishonesty (especially orchestrated by mortgage
          brokers, banks and within credit-ratings agencies). The situation eventually
          triggered the US' 2007 'housing bubble' and housing market crash that
          spiraled into the major financial meltdown and crisis of 2007-2008,
          benefiting and profiting those who had manipulated the market, while
          leaving millions of others homeless and unemployed.</font> </p>      </td>

        Spielberg<br />
        Spielbeg's Cold War thriller was based on historical facts surrounding
        the early 1960s exchange of spy-prisoners on the Glienicke Bridge connecting
         Potsdam with Berlin. In dramatic fashion, it followed the earlier work
        of idealistic Brooklyn insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks)
        who in the 1957 trial  (nicknamed the Hollow Nickel Case) had represented
        convicted Soviet KGB spy Colonel Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) (aka William
        August Fisher). He was able to convince the presiding Judge Mortimer
        W. Byers (Dakin Matthews) to have his defendant's sentence reduced from
        the death penalty to a 30-year penitentiary term for undercover espionage
        against the U.S. Then, Donovan was again hired by the CIA to be involved
        as a negotiator in a high-stakes international hostage situation between
        the US and the Soviets. He worked to facilitate the exchange of Rudolf
        Abel for notorious USAF pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) who
        flew a U-2 spy plane over the USSR in 1960 and was shot down and imprisoned.
        Donovan was also masterfully able to secure the release of wrongfully-imprisoned
        American graduate student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), who had been
        arrested in East Germany. The exchanges took place on February 10, 1962
        almost simultaneously - Powers and Abel at the Glienicke Bridge, and
        Pryor at Checkpoint Charlie.</font></p>        </td>

        John Crowley's romantic, coming-of-age, immigration-based period drama
        was adapted from Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's 2009 novel of the same
        name. It was set in 1951 during a time of heavy Irish migration to the
        US (specifically NYC). The central character was meek, small-town
         Irish girl Eilis Lacey (Saoirse Ronan) from Enniscorthy (Wexford County)
         in SE Ireland. To seek employment, it was arranged with US sponsor -
         Irish priest Father Flood (Jim Broadbent), for her to emigrate to Brooklyn,
         NY, where she first found lodging with other similar immigrants in a
         crowded boarding house headed by gossipy Ms. Kehoe (Julie Walters).
        Despite being homesick and lonely, she resourcefully took bookkeeping-accounting
         classes at night at Brooklyn College, and worked during the day as a
         shopgirl at Bartocci's - a Brooklyn department store. At an Irish dance,
        she met amiable, blue-collar, hard-working Italian-American Tony Fiorello
        (Emory Cohen), a local plumber, and they dated before secretly marrying
        at City Hall. At the same time in mid-1952, the death of Eilis' unmarried
        older sister Rose (Fiona Glascott) forced her to return to Ireland, where
        she put her accounting skills to use and was also courted by attractive,
        charming, well-off bachelor Jimmy Farrell (Domhnall Gleeson), while remaining
        non-committal to him. When forced with the bittersweet choice of two
        destinies - her stifling, provincial Irish hometown or a house on Long
        Island with Tony, she chose the latter way of life.</font></p>        </td>

          Todd Haynes' romantic melodrama of a secret, intimate and risky forbidden
          love included feminist themes and gay/lesbian sexual content. The R-rated,
          modern-day &quot;womens' picture&quot; was set mostly in late 1952 - a very restrictive,
          prejudicial, sexist and conformist period. It followed the unexpected
          development of an affair between two females in different social-spheres
          in NYC: aspiring photographer Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) who worked
          as a shop-girl clerk in Frankenberg's, a Manhattan department store,
          and older, glamorous, and elegant New Jersey housewife Carol Aird (Cate
          Blanchett) who was about to endure a difficult divorce from her husband
          Harge (Kyle Chandler). The estranged couple were engaged in a loveless
          marriage with a young daughter named Rindy (Kk Heim).
          Although Therese had a boyfriend named Richard Semco (Jack Lacy), a
          spark immediately developed with Carol after the two first met at the
          toy counter of the store during Christmas-time. Harge became suspicious
          of their friendship because of Carol's previous lesbian relationship
          with her best friend and former lover Abby Gerhard (Sarah Paulson).
          During ongoing divorce proceedings over the custody of their daughter,
          Harge raised questions to the judge about his wife Carol's homosexuality
          and lack of fitness as a mother. He also secretly hired
          a private investigator Tommy Tucker (Cory Michael Smith) to document
          Carol's increasing romantic involvement with Therese (including their
          conversations and sexual encounter in their hotel room) during their
           road-trip to the Mid-West over the Christmas-New Years' holidays.
          Facing painful social ostracism and bigotry, would the passionate attraction

        Spike Lee's preachy and controversial urban drama (peppered with  musical-dance
            performances and hip-hop rhymes) presented a sex-filled message in
            the form of a modern-day adaptation of <i>Lysistrata</i>,
            an ancient, centuries-old play written in 411 BC by Aristophanes.
            In the original Greek play, women withheld sex from their warrior-men
             until they called for a cease-fire in the Peloponnesian War. The
            hyphenated title referred to the locales of Chicago, IL and Iraq
            (both with high murder and death rates). The compelling political
            satire told about two warring rival gangs located in the south side
            of the city of Chicago (in the low-income Englewood neighborhood):
            the purple-clad Spartans led by underground rapper-gang leader Demetrius &quot;Chi-Raq&quot; Dupree
            (Nick Cannon), and the orange-clad Trojans headed by eye-patch-wearing
            Sean &quot;Cyclops&quot; Andrews
            (Wesley Snipes). The potential for more black-on-black violence escalated
            when 11 year-old innocent neighborhood girl Patti was killed during
            a gang drive-by shooting following a concert. Together with anti-violence
            matriarchal advocate Miss Helen Worthy (Angela Bassett), Chi-Raq's
            lover-girlfriend Lysistrata (Teyonah Parris) announced after a meeting
            of the female lovers on both sides that they would seek a peaceful
            armistice  by holding a sex strike and vowing abstinence, with
            the boycott slogan: &quot;No Peace, No Pussy.&quot; They also boldly
            took over a local military armory to stage their protest via celibacy.
            Meanwhile, the grief-stricken mother Irene (Jennifer Hudson) demanded
            justice for her little girl, and was joined by efforts of anti-gun,
            local activist Father Mike Corridan (John Cusack) in a black church
            to rally for government and community involvement. The always-present
            one-person &quot;Greek Chorus&quot; was conveyed by narrator Dolemedes (Samuel
            L. Jackson) who often presented soliloquys to the camera. Ultimately,
            the boycott was successful and helped quell further violence, and
            brought the killer forward to tearfully confess to Patti's murder. </font> </p>      </td>

        B. Jordan), the (illegitimate) son of famous former world heavyweight
        champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), who was Rocky's (Sylvester Stallone)

        the Soviet Union's Ivan Drago. With aspirations to be a boxer like his
        father without riding on his coat-tails, in 2015, Adonis trained in Tijuana
        and fought in amateur boxing bouts before leaving his investment banking
        day-job in LA and moving to Philadelphia to become a pro boxer, under
        the tutelage of Apollo's old friend and rival, Rocky Balboa. He began
        training and mentoring at the Front Street Gym with Rocky, and also began

        Conlan (Anthony Bellew), while aging Rocky's own declining health began
        to deteriorate as the date for the light heavyweight title fight approached.

        The lives of   Danish painters Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener, and David
        Ebershoff's 2004 novel of the same name formed the basis for this biographical
        romantic drama about transgender identity. In the real-life story, a
        married couple: androgynous-looking landscape artist Einar Wegener (Eddie
        Redmayne) and portrait artist Gerda Wegener (Alicia Vikander), lived
        and painted together in Copenhagen in the mid-1920s. The turning point
        for Einar came when Gerda's painting model failed to arrive, and Einar
        posed for her in a dress and pantyhose. The profound experience of dressing
        as a woman caused Einar to realize his deep-seated gender identity as
        a woman, and he renamed himself as transformed female Lili Elbe to adopt
        the new identity. Feeling trapped in the wrong body, he began to consider
        a sex-change operation. Facing discrimination and accusations of mental
        illness in Denmark, the couple traveled to Germany to find an accommodating
        surgeon, Dr. Kurt Warnekros (Sebastian Koch). There, Lili became one
        of the first documented, male-to-female sex-reassignment surgery recipients

      In this coming-of-age story set in San Francisco in 1976, 15-year-old aspiring

          Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), who had won a company-wide lottery contest
          at his high-tech work place -  the popular search engine company Blue Book.

        Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) visited his defeated and

      been discovered in a melting glacier more than 50 years after she
      disappeared into a crevasse during a hiking vacation with him in the Alps
      in Switzerland. After this startling discovery, Kate realized that Geoff
      was exhibiting signs of distress - moodiness, increased smoking, and disquiet.
      She began to look more closely into her husband's past by secretly perusing
      through some of her memorabilia in the attic, including a slide carousel
      with images showing Katya's apparent pregnancy at the time of her death.
      Kate's discovery of unforeseen revelations began to change her perceptions
      of her husband's former self and doubt their entire past relationship.</font></p>      </td>

        Tarantino<br />
        Typical of Tarantino's films, this bloody, violent and vulgar revisionist
        western was a lengthy, who-dun-it thriller about a group of &quot;hateful
        eight&quot; strangers who sought refuge in a stagecoach mountain lodge known
        as Minnie's Haberdashery during a blinding snowstorm. Set in a post-Civil
        War period in the year 1870, bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt
        Russell) was transporting handcuffed fugitive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer
        Jason Leigh) to Red Rock, WY to be executed (by hanging). On his stagecoach
        journey, he met up with fellow bounty hunter and ex-Union soldier Major
        Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) (with his three dead bounties) and
        ex-Confederate rebel militiaman Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) - who claimed
        he was Red Rock's next town sheriff. A fifth individual was stagecoach
        driver O.B. (James Parks). The group was forced to shelter at the lodge
        where four additional strangers were already in place: Mexican caretaker
        Se&ntilde;or Bob (aka Marco 'The Mexican') (Demi&aacute;n
        Bichir), British executioner  &quot;Oswaldo
        Mobray&quot; (aka Pete 'English Pete' Hicox) (Tim Roth) - Red Rock's
        newly-appointed hangman, cowboy Joe Gage (aka 'Grouch' Douglass) (Michael
        Madsen), and ex-Confederate General Sanford &quot;Sandy&quot; Smithers (Bruce Dern).
        In the claustrophic, entrapping confines of Minnie's isolated place,
        each of the various desperate, deadly and paranoid individuals revealed
        their true intentions and identities, and connections to each other.
        One by one, group members (some imposters) bargained for their lives
        but eventually, all were eliminated or dying - including the last two
        survivors: Mannix and Warren. </font></p></td>

        Ronnie Del Carmen<br /> Disney/Pixar's computer-animated fantasy-comedy was the studios' 15th
        feature film. Its main themes were the up-and-down turmoils of growing
        up and ways to control one's most prominent emotions. The very original
        animation followed the personified emotions of hockey-loving, 11 year-old
        Riley's (voice of Kaitlyn Dias) personality when she was uprooted from
        her Midwestern home in Minnesota by her parents (voices of Diane Lane
        and Kyle MacLachlan) to a new environment in San Francisco. Her five
        basic emotions were personified as Joy (voice of Amy Poehler), Sadness
        (voice of Phyllis Smith), Anger (voice of Lewis Black), Fear (voice of
        Bill Hader), and Disgust (voice of Mindy Kaling). The control center
        inside Riley's mind, known as Headquarters (HQ), housed the five emotions,
        who voiced their concerns as Riley went about her adjustment to the city,
        school, and her new home. Riley's most powerful emotion Joy, one that
        usually kept her with a positive and optimistic attitude, was soon overwhelmed
        by other conflicting feelings. In a time of disorder and crisis during
        Riley's first day at school, Joy and Sadness, along with Riley's core
        memories, were sucked into long-term memory storage, allowing the other
        three emotions to dominate Riley's life symbolic of the tumultuous emotions
        of a teenager. During their displacement and their struggles to return
        to HQ, Joy and Sadness journeyed through other parts of her mind - including
        an area known as the Memory Dump, a decompression chamber titled &quot;Abstract
        Thought,&quot; and a dream-producing movie studio. Eventually, Riley was able
        to create a new  core memory combining both happiness and sadness, once
        she realistically accepted the good and the bad aspects of her new life. </font></p>        </td>

      The central character of this inspiring, real-life, biographical dramedy
          was &quot;Joy&quot; Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence), a struggling working-class single
          mother who became a self-made millionaire by inventing the Miracle
          Mop. Her many challenges and struggles were reviewed, including flashbacks
          to briefly survey her dysfunctional childhood on Long Island. Then,
          in 1990 her struggles continued with her large and complicated extended
          family living together in Peconic, Suffolk County, NY, while she worked
          as an Eastern Airlines booking clerk-agent. She had always let go of
          her own inspirations, inventive ideas and dreams (of an education),
          and was stuck living with her TV soap opera-addicted single mother
          Terri (Virginia Madsen). Joy was a divorced mother with two children
          from a failed marriage with her lazy ex-husband Tony Miranne (&Eacute;dgar
          Ram&iacute;rez) who was living in the basement along with her three-times-divorced
          father Rudy (Robert De Niro). Taking a risk by using all her life's
          savings and taking out a 2nd home mortgage, and with money invested
          by Rudy's newest  girlfriend - wealthy and widowed Trudy (Isabella
          Rossellini), she invented and then began to produce and market a household
          product known as the revolutionary, self-wringing Miracle Mop. Her
          big break came after she met executive Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper)
          at the home-shopping network QVC, but she also faced many legal and
          financial issues before finally becoming successful, and serving as

              and scary action-adventure sci-fi thriller reboot about the dinosaur-themed
              park with genetically-cloned dinosaurs providing entertainment
              for masses of visitors. It was the highest-grossing (domestic)
              film of 2015. It served as the first film in a new trilogy of &quot;Jurassic
              World&quot; installments,
              set on the same fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar.
              The time period followed what occurred in<i> Jurassic Park III
              (2001)</i>,
              set about 22 years after the original 1993 film. The film opened
              during school's winter break when Karen Mitchell (Judy Greer) sent
              her two young sons: older teenaged brother Zachary &quot;Zach&quot; Mitchell
              (Nick Robinson) and younger Gray Mitchell (Ty Simpkins), to visit
               their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), the operations manager
              of Jurassic World. One of the park's newest attractions was a huge
              transgenic-hybrid dinosaur known as &quot;Indominus Rex.&quot; The
              owner of the park - CEO Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) instructed
              Claire to send Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a Navy SEAL and velociraptor
              expert in the behavioral-sciene facility at the park, to inspect
              the anti-social and more dangerous <i>Indominus</i>
              creature housed in a fortifed enclosure. Once the <i>Indominus</i> escaped,
              using its camouflaging and heat-signature techniques, it endangered
              the park's visitors as it went on a killing spree. The tourists
              were evacuated while initial efforts by Masrani and his security
              team lethally failed to stop the monstrous Rex. Pterosaurs escaped
              from the aviary, causing increased havoc. Vic Hoskins (Vincent
              D'Onofrio), head of InGen security, strategized that the velociraptors
              could be weaponized to destroy the rampaging <i>Indominus</i>,
              an idea initially opposed by Owen but now used as the last resort
              to save the park. </font></p>      </td>

          As in all the previous three installments of the <i>Mad Max</i> franchise,
          the setting for this reboot about survival was  a post-apocalyptic
          desert wasteland (after nuclear war) where two scarce commodities (water
          and petrol) continued to be in constant demand. The main surviving
          protagonist, loner-drifter Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), was imprisoned
          by evil, despotic, grotesquely face-masked cult
          leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army of deranged, albino
          War Boys, and taken to Joe's Citadel. At the same time, one of Joe's
          lieutenants, a war-rig operator/driver named Imperator
          Furiosa (Charlize Theron), was sent out on a mission in an armored
          tanker-truck (&quot;War
          Rig&quot;)  to nearby Gas Town to collect gasoline and ammunition.
          However, Furiosa betrayed Joe by kidnapping five of his 'breeding'
          brides and taking flight. A violent, non-stop chase sequence ensued,
          with Joe's army (with Max strapped to the front of Nux's (Nicholas
          Hoult) vehicle while providing an IV blood-bank drip to the ailing
          Nux) in swift pursuit of Furiosa. After escaping from Nux, Max joined
          forces with Furiosa (and the five wives) and her &quot;War Rig&quot; - and the
          group sought to locate Furiosa's idyllic childhood home known as the
          Green Place, but it was uninhabitable. They were forced to turn around
          and head straight back to Joe's Citadel, setting off another long chase
          sequence, for an ultimate confrontation. </font></p>        </td>

        Scott<br />
        Director Ridley Scott's sci-fi space thriller was based upon Andy Weir's
        2011 best-selling novel of the same name. The film's prominent tagline:
        &quot;BRING HIM HOME&quot; spotlighted the story's major dilemma:  astronaut and
        botany specialist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) was part of NASA's manned
        Ares 3 mission in the year 2035 to  explore the planet of Mars and collect
        soil samples. While exploring the planet's surface, a severe dust storm
        had stranded Watney from his crew, and he was presumed dead and left
        behind when  they made an emergency evacuation and lifted off the surface in their MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle)
            to return to their orbiting vessel, the <i>Hermes</i>. Although
          injured, Watney recovered but faced overwhelming odds - he had no communications
          equipment, and his only means of survival was to ration and grow food
          and create water in a makeshift greenhouse inside the crew's left-behind
            surface habitat (or &quot;Hab&quot;).
          Meanwhile back on Earth, Mindy Park
          (Mackenzie Davis), one of NASA's satellite analysts  at Mission Control,
           suspected correctly that Watney had survived. Watney was
          forced to struggle with basic survival, while there were valiant efforts
          to return him to Earth, when NASA jointly worked with JPL (Jet Propulsion
          Laboratory) to devise creative (but highly risky) solutions to rescue
           him and bring him home. It was ultimately decided to have the returning
           Ares 3 crew, commanded by Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), change
           course and return to Mars by using Earth's gravity to orbitally &quot;slingshot&quot; back

        The title word &quot;revenant&quot; referred to a French term for a person who
        returned or came back after a death or long absence. In this violent,
        epic revenge western set in the year 1823,  the camp site of Captain
        Henry's (Domhnall Gleeson) pelt and fur-trapping expedition, led by experienced
        frontier explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the present-day Dakotas,
        was brutally attacked by a group of Native-American Indians (from the
        Arikara tribe). The Indians were on the war path to locate the Chief's
        abducted daughter, Powaqa (Melaw Nakehk'o). With his teenaged half-Indian
        son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) - fathered by his deceased Pawnee wife, Glass
        led the few surviving members of the group to the safety of a trading
        post known as Fort Kiowa. Afterwards while out hunting game, Glass was
        brutally mauled by a grizzly bear and left with a broken leg. He was
        put into the care of trapper John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), Jim Bridger
        (Will Poulter), and his son Hawk. The threesome planned to remain with
        Glass until he died, so that he could be decently buried. The selfish
        and roughneck Fitzgerald, who was attempting to mercy-kill Glass by smothering,
        was forced to stab Hawk to death in the abdomen when the boy tried to
        stop him. Then, Fitzgerald convinced Bridger (who didn't know about Hawk's
        murder) to leave Glass to die, due to a falsely-alleged an imminent
        Ree Indian attack. Glass was left unarmed, stranded and half-buried alive
        in a shallow, makeshift grave. Back at the fort, Fitzgerald falsely reported
        that Glass had died and that Hawk had vanished. The remainder of the
        extended story was Glass' struggle to survive in the wilderness, regain
        his strength and heal, and then to seek Fitzgerald for depraved and compensatory
        revenge. Rather than killing Fitzgerald himself, Glass let him float
        downstream in a river - directly into the hands of the Arikara who scalped
        him, in retaliation for Powaqa's abduction and rape by other whites.</font></p>        </td>

      Adapted from Emma Donoghue's 2010 novel of the same name, this extremely-emotional
          and difficult-to-watch drama followed the ghastly and prolonged 7 year-long
          kidnapping situation faced by precocious 5-year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay)
          and his mother or &quot;Ma&quot; - 24-year-old Joy Newsome (Brie Larson). The
          incarcerated mother and son were both held and enclosed in a single
          'Room' in a backyard shed in Akron, OH, where Jack had been born in
          captivity. Their sadistic and psychopathic kidnapper who held them
          captive for years, known only as &quot;Old Nick&quot; (Sean Bridgers), was Jack's
          biological father, and continued to periodically rape Joy during regular
          nocturnal visits. Both suffered from malnutrition and depression, since
          they were secluded in a small shared space with only one skylight as
          a window. The cloistered, socially-repressed and sheltered Jack was
          led to believe by his &quot;Ma&quot; that they weren't captives, and that the
          world they read about in books or saw on television were only fantasies.

          to daringly escape (by faking his death) in order to break away from
          their captor. But now that they were traumatically inserted back in

          - a dangerous section of the US-Mexico border known for activities
          of ruthless Mexican drug cartels, traffickers and kingpins. She volunteered
          to work in the government's anti-drug task force after a booby-trapped
          bomb turned deadly during her raid on a cartel safe-house in Chandler,
          AZ near Phoenix. Her new drug-fighting unit was directed by CIA officer
          Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) working for the Defense Dept., and her immediate
          boss was Dave Jennings (Victor Garber), while she was partnered with
          rookie teammate Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya). They were aided by a
          mysterious and secretive cartel defector - an enforcer-assassin named Alejandro
          Gillick (Benicio Del Toro), who had detailed knowledge of the cartel's
          organization. Their main targets were senior members of a Sonora drug
          cartel, including its powerful head Manuel D&iacute;az (Bernardo Saracino),
          his second in command Guillermo D&iacute;az (Edgar Arreola), Manuel's
          brother, and elusive drug lord Fausto Alarc&oacute;n (Julio Cesar Cedillo).
          Kate's initial idealism was tempered after she witnessed tremendous
          brutality and life-threatening situations, and she came to the realization
          that she was only a small part of a much larger and questionable plan.
          She began to see that her team's methods were ethically unconventional,
          unorthodox, and often illegal. And she learned that the CIA's ultimate
          motive was to eliminate all of the Mexican drug cartels so that the
          US could more easily control drug-trade if the Colombians were 
          the only threat. </font></p>      </td>

        The 24th film in the long-running series-franchise, and a direct sequel
        to the events that transpired in <i><a href="series-jamesbond23.html">Skyfall
        (2012)</a></i>.  In the plot, rogue 007 agent James Bond (Daniel Craig in his fourth film) was still
        seeking revenge for the death of M (Judi Dench), his former mentor. He
         went on an unauthorized mission to Mexico City to kill mysterious Italian
        terrorist mobster/assassin Marco Sciarra. After being temporarily removed
        from duty by a new M (Gareth Mallory) (Ralph Fiennes), he followed a
        trail to Rome to meet with the dead man's widow Lucia Sciarra (Monica
        Bellucci). After infiltrating a secret meeting, Bond uncovered the existence
        of a sinister, global criminal organization known as SPECTRE (SPecial
        Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion),
        created and led by Franz Oberhauser (aka mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld)
        (Christoph Waltz), who was promoting worldwide terrorist attacks. An
        exciting car chase through Rome occurred between SPECTRE assassin Mr.
        Hinx (Dave Bautista) and Bond. In Austria, Bond met with poisoned and
        dying Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) - once a member of a SPECTRE subsidiary,
        who suggested a meeting with his daughter, Dr. Madeleine Swann (L&eacute;a
        Seydoux), before he committed suicide. After a chase on the Austrian
        slopes where Swann was kidnapped by Hinx, she helped lead Bond to SPECTRE
        - located in Morocco, where they again fought off Hinx on a moving train
        on their way to SPECTRE's headquarters in the Saharan Desert. Devious
        British agent Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott) (code-named C) was revealed
        to be working in London with SPECTRE (while setting up a &quot;Nine Eyes&quot; surveillance
        program that would eliminate Bond's division). After confronting
        Blofeld in his base, Swann and Bond blew up Blofeld's headquarters and
        fled to London,  to prevent Nine Eyes from going online. In the conclusion,
        Bond once again rescued Swann who was threatened to die in an old MI6
        building, and defeated a seriously-injured Blofeld (fleeing in a helicopter
        that crashed), who was subsequently arrested by M.</font></p></td>

      This true-to-life biographical docu-drama, a thought-provoking Best Picture
          winning film, was titled to reference <i>The Boston Globe's </i>select, trail-blazing 'Spotlight'
          team - the oldest continuously-operating newspaper journalist
          unit in the US. The elite team's investigative articles were published
          in 2002 (and awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 2003), after it thoroughly
          looked into a widespread pattern of systemic child sex abuse allegations
          against some of Boston's Roman Catholic priests. The newspaper's new
          editor-in-chief Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), met with 'Spotlight's'
          editorial supervisor Walter &quot;Robby&quot; Robinson
          (Michael Keaton), who was in charge of the <i>Globe's</i>  internal
          team of reporters, including Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo),
          Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matty Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James).
          The team also coordinated their work with lawyer Mitchell Garabedian
          (Stanley Tucci). During research and case work through interviews with
          abuse victims, the reporters produced an extensive expos&eacute; that revealed
          an ongoing, willful cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese and its Archbishop
          Cardinal Bernard Francis Law (Len Cariou). He had systematically ignored
          and buried decades-old, multiple instances of corruption and abuse
          by priests in the Boston area, before he was promoted to a Basilica
          in Rome. </font></p></td>

        This 7th installment in the popular sci-fi series-franchise served as
        the  first part of a sequel trilogy of more epic <i>Star Wars</i> films
        (Episodes VII, VIII and IX) - the reboot was released 32 years after
          its immediate chronological predecessor, <i>Star Wars: Episode VI -
          Return of the Jedi (1983)</i>. The setting was  30  
          years after the defeat of the Galactic Empire,
          portrayed in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. The galaxy was still at war,
          pitting the New Republic (and its Resistance fighters) - led by General
          Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) against the villainous forces of the First
          Order, successors of the Galactic Empire. Meanwhile, Leia's twin brother
          Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, had vanished and gone
          into hiding. The militarized, fascistic First Order was led by dark,
          masked Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and villainous General Hux (Domhnall
          Gleeson), the commander of the Starkiller base. In the film's opening
          on the junk planet of Jakku, brave Resistance X-wing fighter pilot
          Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) was captured, although his droid BB-8 was
          able to escape with a secret map to Skywalker's whereabouts. Disillusioned
          and rogue First Order stormtrooper FN-2187 (later renamed Finn (John
          Boyega)) changed sides and freed Poe, before they both fled in a stolen
          TIE fighter. Ultimately, desert-dwelling young scavenger Rey (Daisy
          Ridley) (who was protecting BB-8) teamed up with Finn, and they stole
          the smuggling duo Han Solo's (Harrison Ford) and Wookiee Chewbacca's
          (Peter Mayhew) old  <i>Millennium
          Falcon</i> to escape. Members of the Resistance (including Solo and
          Chewbacca after their return) worked together to protect the droid
          and take it back to their leader General Leia Organa. While Han was
          attempting to destroy the Starkiller base with explosives, Kylo (the
          son of Han and Leia, and Luke's nephew) confronted his father and killed
          him. Afterwards, Poe was able to attack and destroy the base's thermal
          oscillator, and the Resistance forces successfully fled just before
          the Starkiller Base imploded. The final image was of Luke - located
          by Rey on a cliffside, island hilltop on the oceanic planet of Ahch-To. </font></p>        </td>

      Aaron Sorkin's  adapted screenplay for this dramatic R-rated biopic of
          the life of computer genius and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs (portrayed
          by Michael Fassbender) was adapted from Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography,
          composed of Sorkin's interviews over a 14 year period (1984-1998).
          There were a number of key events (and evidences of Jobs' personal
          flaws) that were covered in the account: the unveiling of the Macintosh
          computer (128K) in a 1984 product launch, his ongoing paternity lawsuit
          dispute and reconciliation with his ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan
          (Katherine Waterston) over his young (and illegitimate) daughter Lisa
          Brennan-Jobs (various actresses from age 5-19), the 1988 founding of

          with his long-time trusted confidant - NeXT marketing executive Joanna
          Hoffman (Kate Winslet), his dealings with Apple co-founder and Apple

        A combination biopic and musical drama, this R-rated film was set in
        a racially-turbulent Los Angeles, CA in the mid-1980s, when Hip Hop and
        its culture began to permeate into society. It followed the rise (and
        fall) of an aspiring, incendiary gangsta rap group known as N.W.A. in
        the South Central neighborhood of Compton, featuring three main members:
        drug-dealing Eric &quot;Eazy-E&quot; Wright (Jason
        Mitchell), rapper O'Shea &quot;Ice Cube&quot; Jackson  (son O'Shea Jackson,
        Jr.) known for composing the group's memorable lyrics, and DJ Andre &quot;Dr.
        Dre&quot; Young (Corey Hawkins). Their
        shows caught the attention of music manager Jerry Heller
        (Paul Giamatti), who helped to get the group  established and known
        through record deals. The film was named for NWA's
        popular debut album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; released in 1988,
        with the fiery song &quot; F--k tha Police.&quot; After
        attaining stardom and visibility, the controversial group became known
        as  &quot;The World's Most Dangerous Group&quot; for their brash style, vulgar lyrics, and
        in-your-face &quot;reality rap&quot; (about issues facing the African-American
        community). The group soon dissolved due to money disputes, opposition
        from law enforcement, and the desire of some members to go solo.</font></p></td>

      This low-budget dramedy with non-professional actors told about outcast,
          misunderstood transgender individuals. It was notable for being filmed
          with three iPhone 5S smartphones to create realistic immediacy. It
          was the story of transgender sex worker Sin-Dee Rella (Kitana Kiki
          Rodriguez) who - in the film's opening - was released in Tinseltown
          (West Hollywood) at Christmas-time after a 28 day-long prison sentence
          for drug possession. At a 24 hour Donut Time shop, she learned from
          fellow trans-gender sex worker Alexandra (Mya Taylor) that Sin-Dee's
          fiancee/boyfriend/pimp and drug-dealing Chester (James Ransone) had
          recently been cheating on her with a female Caucasian prostitute (one
          with &quot;a vagina and everything&quot; - known as a cisfemale). During a raging
          and vengeful search in the Santa Monica and Highland neighborhoods,
          the jealously-furious Sin-Dee dragged Dinah (Mickey O'Hagan) out of
          Madam Jillian's (Chelcie Lynn) motel bordello, and with Alexandra,
          brought Dinah to the donut shop to confront Chester in a show-down.
          But then Chester shockingly confessed that Alexandra was also sleeping
          with him. Hurt by the betrayal of her best friend, Sin-Dee departed
          and attempted to pick up male clients, but they threw urine at her
          and drove away while yelling out trans-phobic insults at her. The film
          concluded with Alexandra helping Sin-Dee to clean up in a laundromat.
          Knowing that Sin-Dee felt uncomfortable without her wig (while it was
          being laundered), Alexandra removed her own wig to lend it to her,
          and the two reconciled - a true representation of the Christmas spirit.
          A concurrent side-story told about married Armenian cab driver Ramzik
          (Karren Karagulian) who was a frequent client of the male 'girls' -
          a secret that was discovered by his nagging mother-in-law Ashken (Alla
          Tumanian) and Ramzik's wife Yeva (Luiza Nersisyan).</font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Trumbo (2015)</b>, 124 minutes, D:  Jay Roach<br />
        In this  smart biographical drama set between the late 1940s and early
            1960s, the title character referred to well-respected and famous
            elite Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston). The
            biopic was based on Bruce Alexander Cook's 1977 biography of the
            beleaguered writer. When it was rumored that Trumbo had past affiliations
            with the Communist Party, he was hauled before the HUAC (the House
            Un-American Activities Committee) during the McCarthy Era. Along
            with many others, he was questioned during a rampant period of &quot;witch
            hunts,&quot; and
            faced contempt of Congress charges for refusing to answer to false
            accusations, and to bend to prejudicial questions about Communist
            propaganda in films. He was accused of being a 'Communist sympathizer'
            and arrested with nine other colleagues - all of the &quot;Hollywood
            Ten&quot;
            faced blacklisting - literally, the end of their careers, and Trumbo
            also served almost a year of jail time in 1950. Afterwards,
            Trumbo secretly penned  the screenplay for the popular romantic
            comedy <i><a href="roma.html">Roman
            Holiday (1953)</a></i>,
            and his friend Ian McLellan Hunter (Alan Tudyk) acted as a pseudonym &quot;front&quot; -
             Hunter's name was listed as the credited screenwriter and he 
            received the Best Story Academy Award for Trumbo's work. The film
            also surveyed the domestic conflict that Trumbo's marriage suffered
            in his relationship with his wife Cleo Fincher Trumbo (Diane Lane),
            his family, and his friends. Trumbo also wrote the Oscar-winning,
            original story screenplay (with the pseudonym Robert Rich) for the
            King Brothers' film <i>The Brave One (1953)</i>. By the early 1960s,
            Trumbo's genius became evident and he was vindicated when he openly
            wrote the screenplays for actor/producer Kirk Douglas' and director
            Stanley Kubrick's epic slave revolt film <i><a href="spartacus1960.html">Spartacus (1960)</a></i>,
            and for director Otto Preminger's  Zionist epic <i>Exodus (1960)</i>.</font></p>
