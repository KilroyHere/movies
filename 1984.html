          <p><font size="2"><b><a href="amadeus.html">Amadeus (1984)</a>, </b>158 minutes, D: Milos Forman<br />
            Milos Forman's stunning, opulent, Best Picture-winning biography
                and compelling character study (not always 100% accurate, however)
                of musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was based on the
                Broadway play by Peter Shaffer (whose screenplay adaptation won
                him an Oscar). It was perhaps Forman's grandest production, equaling
                his earlier Best Picture winner <em><a href="onef.html">One
                Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)</a> </em>that  was only challenged
          by his later film <em>The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)</em>. <i>Amadeus</i> 
          was well-received by both critics and audiences alike with its lavish
          set and period costume design (filmed on location in Prague), its accessibility
          and non-pretentiousness, and its sly intelligence and musings over
          the capricious nature of &quot;God-given&quot; talent. In
          the film's opening set in 19th century Vienna (Austria), the
              official but obscure royal composer - an aging Antonio Salieri
              (1750-1825) (Oscar-winning F. Murray Abraham) for Austrian Emperor
              Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), was convalescing after an attempted
              suicide for his admitted murder of great 36 year-old musical prodigy
              Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). During an end-of-life confession
              in an asylum-sanitarium to young priest Father Vogler (Richard
              Frank), the demented Salieri told an amazing, lengthy intercutting
          flashback of his envious loathing, yet reverential relationship to
          Mozart, who was portrayed as simultaneously irresponsible, spoiled,
          vulgar, childish, and dissolute but immensely talented. The
              mediocre Salieri revealed how he was slowly tormented and driven
              insane as he ironically recognized Mozart's incredible musical
              genius and brilliance, but was consumed with insecurity, bitterness
              and jealousy. The self-hating Salieri believed he had been betrayed
              and mocked by God through Mozart, and had no interest in penance,
              but would rather denounce God. When he first met Mozart, the austere
              Salieri was disgusted and shocked by the prodigy's brash and crude
              hedonism with full-figured commoner Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge),
              his landlady's daughter, whom Mozart would marry. It angered Salieri
              that Mozart's talent was so effortless - and always mocking him
          with shrill and high pitched giggles of laughter - and that he composed
          music without ever making corrections. A turning point came when Salieri
              attended Mozart's performance of <i>Don Giovanni</i> following
              the death of his estranged and disapproving father Leopold Mozart
              (Roy Doltrice) in Salzburg, Germany - it was clear to the sinister
              Salieri that he should now vengefully bring about Mozart's downfall.
              The deceitful Salieri disguised himself with a black cloak and
              mask (to remind the guilt-ridden Mozart of his father) - and came
              to Mozart as a messenger, to compel
            the sick, now-alcoholic and ailing Mozart to accept a commission
              to write a <i>Requiem Mass.</i> As Mozart struggled with the composition
          and was slowly dying, Salieri fantasized that the <i>Requiem</i> would
          be performed at Mozart's funeral - and that he would claim it
          as his own work after Mozart's death: (&quot;A
          great mass of death! Requiem mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by
          his devoted friend, Antonio Salieri!&quot;). Desperate for income
              and finding Constanze had deserted him after a night of debauchery,
              Mozart went ahead with Salieri's demands to immediately finish
              the mass by dictating  it to him. Just before Mozart's
          passing, Constanze returned to take possession of the inspired composition
          and lock it away from Salieri. Mozart's body was dumped into a pauper's
          mass grave - his unceremonial death ended Salieri's flashback to the
          priest, who was horrified by the tale from 32 years earlier. Salieri
          became further insane as he denounced God as cruel: (&quot;He (God)
          killed Mozart and kept me alive to torture! 32 years of torture! 32
          years of slowly watching myself become extinct&quot;). As he was wheeled
              away on the brink of madness, Salieri credited himself as the patron
           saint of mediocrity: &quot;I speak for all mediocrities in
          the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint....Mediocrities
              everywhere... I absolve you... I absolve you... I absolve you...
          I absolve you... I absolve you all.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

        The fish-out-of-water comedy starred unknown Brooklyn
        comic Eddie Murphy, initially on TV's <i>Saturday
        Night Live,</i> who was propelled to stardom with this series. This
        film was his highest-grossing live-action movie, and
        the biggest box-office hit of the year (at $234.8 million), barely edging
        out <i><a href="ghos.html">Ghostbusters
          (1984)</a> </i> at # 2 with $229.2 million (domestic). Fast-talking,
            smart-mouthed Axel Foley (Murphy) - an undercover Detroit police
            detective, was  engaged in a relentless pursuit from his hometown
            to the city of Los Angeles. Foley was searching for the killers of
              his old &quot;hoodlum friend&quot; and ex-crime partner &quot;Mikey&quot; Tandino
            (James Russo). The street-smart, reckless cop was continually at

              minutes, D: Ivan Reitman<br />
              Director Ivan Reitman's successful sci-fi fantasy comedy  
             told  about a trio of eccentric parapsychologists called upon
            to investigate hauntings in various NYC locations. It featured the
            catchy theme tune: &quot;Who ya gonna call? - Ghostbusters!&quot; and
            the film's logo: a red-lined &quot;No Ghosts&quot; sign. Its tagline
          was: &quot;They're Here to Save the World.&quot; In the film's opening,
          an  unorthodox group of three unusual Columbia
          University parapsychologists: Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Dr.
          Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Dr. Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis)
          were called upon to investigate a recent sighting of ghosts in the
          basement of the New York Public Library stacks. Later, after discovering
              that their funding at Columbia had been revoked, the threesome
          decided to go into the offbeat business for themselves as paranormal,
          supernatural exterminators to eliminate poltergeists,
          spirits, and ghosts.  The group,
              now known as &quot;GHOSTBUSTERS,&quot; used the funds from the
              mortgaging of Ray's childhood home to purchase and set up their
              headquarters and services in an abandoned, unused, and dilapidated &quot;fixer-upper&quot;
          firehouse. Janine Melnitz (Annie
            Potts) was hired as their new secretary and receptionist, although
          business was non-existent - no calls, no messages, and no customers.
          Classical concert cellist Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) lived at
          550 Central Park West in a huge, ominous-looking residential building
          known as the Ivo Shandor Building (with statues of scary growling dog-creatures
          on its roof). Upon her return via taxi with groceries, she was pestered
              by her nerdy accountant neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) who
          lived across the hall. She realized that her refrigerator was a gateway
          to an &quot;other-worldly&quot; spiritual temple,
          and a small demonic dog-creature growling a single-word: &quot;ZUUL.&quot;
          Shortly later, she   summoned help from the Ghostbusters
          at the firehouse, and Venkman insistently volunteered to help her,
          as a way to acquire a date. Shortly later, the Ghostbusters were hired
          to immediately remove a gluttonous green ghost named Slimer from the
          upscale Sedgewick Hotel. During the attack, Venkman delivered a one-liner
          exclamation to Ray: &quot;He slimed me!&quot; after being covered in
          dripping slime. After entrapping the ghost, the Ghostbusters became
          famous and were forced to hire a fourth Ghostbuster Winston Zeddmore
          (Ernie Hudson). As one of the Ghostbuster customers, Dana became involved
              with the demons and was possessed
              by ancient demi-god Zuul (the &quot;Gatekeeper&quot;). Through
              her refrigerator, their apartment building had become a gateway
              for hell. Her nerdy accountant neighbor Louis also became possessed
              as the &quot;Keymaster&quot;  (aka Vinz Clortho). 
               Venkman arrived for a date with Dana and
                had to pretend to be the &quot;Keymaster&quot; in order to
               be allowed inside her apartment. He was seduced by the possessed
               Dana writhing and levitating atop her bed. Throughout the film,
                EPA agent/lawyer Walter Peck (William Atherton) expressed his
                suspicions about how the Ghostbusters had established an unlicensed
               storage facility for captured ghosts. His  shutdown 
              of their containment unit storage facility had devastating
              consequences - the destructive blast released hundreds of captured
              ghosts back into NYC. The Ivo Shandor building where Dana and Louis
                lived was functioning as an antenna to attract and concentrate
                spiritual energy to summon Gozer and bring about supernatural
              chaos and the apocalypse. Although the Ghostbusters were briefly
                jailed, NYC's Mayor  Lenny Clotchof (David
            Margulies) released them to deal with the dangerous ghost problems,
            prove themselves, and save NYC. Meanwhile,
            Dana and Louis were reunited respectively as Zuul - the Gatekeeper
            and as the Keymaster, and they shared a passionate kiss, before proceeding
            to the building's rooftop to open up a gateway to the ghostly-spectral
            dimension, and await the arrival of Gozer. In the film's conclusion
            set atop the skyscraper,  the Ghostbusters
            were confronted by the monstrous god Gozer, first appearing in
            the shape of a woman, the Gozerian (voice of Paddi Edwards, and portrayed
            by supermodel Slavitza Jovan).  The Ghostbusters with full strength
          in their proton-pack charges neutronized the &quot;nimble little minx.&quot;
          However, Gozer's booming, disembodied voice demanded that they choose
          or select her next physical form: &quot;Choose the form of the Destructor!&quot;;
           Ray tried to clear his mind, but was the only one to think of something,
          and Gozer reappeared  as an evil, menacing, tall
          monstrous 'destructor' - a giant, 100 foot tall Stay Puft Marshmallow
          Man, selectively imagined to be harmless by Ray. The Marshmallow
            Man - a gigantic, 10-story  tall figure terrorized
            the streets, resembling King Kong (or Godzilla) as it lumbered through
          the narrow avenues. Spengler suggested a &quot;radical&quot; idea -
          that the team members cross their proton energy streams at the dimensional
          gate in order to generate a positive energy influx big enough to destroy
          the gateway door, and to obliterate Gozer's portal. The strategy was
          successful, and the previously-possessed Dana and Louis were freed
          when they emerged from the burned, hardened, but broken wreckage of
          the Terror Dog statues (with roasted hair), and were rescued.
          Everyone exited to the street level to depart in the Ecto-1, while
          Louis was ignored and taken away in a Red Cross vehicle. </font></p>

         Director Barry Levinson's allegorical and mythical fairy
          tale film about baseball was based on Bernard Malamud's 1952 story,
          with a soaring score by Randy Newman. It featured Robert Redford as
          Roy Hobbs - a &quot;naturally&quot;-gifted
          baseball-playing prodigy whose life and sports career were sidetracked
          when he was shot by a mysterious, disturbed woman. 16 years later,
          he made a miraculous comeback and led his New York Knights team to
          the World Series. So many magical elements came together to create
          this romanticized film - a Babe Ruth-like slugger named &quot;The Whammer&quot; (Joe
          Don Baker), Hobbs' unexplained silver-bullet shooting, and a legendary &quot;Wonderboy&quot; bat
          (with a lightning bolt inscribed on it and carved out of a tree struck
          by lightning - reminiscent of Excalibur in the heroic King Arthur knights
          tales). The film concluded with the fulfillment of Roy's heroic quest
          - and his reunion with a pure &quot;lady in the white dress&quot; who
          had repeatedly inspired him and watched him from the stands. She was
          his childhood sweetheart and naive ex-girlfriend Iris Gaines (Glenn
          Close), with whom he had unknowingly produced an out-of-wedlock child.</font></p></td>

        Craven's horror film single-handedly revived the teens-in-terror slasher
        flick sub-genre, and ultimately became a major franchise. It revealed
        his intellectual fascination with the subconscious, multi-layered psychic
        worlds, dreams and nightmares. He created one of the most well-known
        horror characters - the sexually-deviant, reincarnated, sadistic, hideously-grotesque
        child killer Freddy Krueger. The premise of the series was that the children
        of Freddy's past persecutors - now grown-up teens (who were at odds with
        their parents) - who fell asleep would experience Freddy's haunting and
        returning presence from Hell. The film elevated the prototypical slasher
        film into an inventive story about the intersection of surreal nightmare
        worlds and the real world (e.g., a geyser of blood pouring from a victim's
        bed). For a showdown with Freddy, smart and resourceful teen heroine
        (Heather Langenkamp) decided to play by 'dream rules' and tricked the
        dream demon into entering her reality so she could defeat him on her
        own turf.</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Repo Man (1984)</b>, 92 minutes, D: Alex Cox<br />
          Director/scriptwriter Alex Cox's off-beat, R-rated debut
            cult film with a punk/New Wave sensibility - a hybrid
          sci-fi black comedy crime film similar in plot to <a href="kiss.html"><i>Kiss
          Me Deadly (1955)</i></a> (and its nuclear Pandora's box),
              was about car repossession in Los Angeles and possible extra-terrestrials
          (ETs). Some of the characters were named after beer brands, for example:
          Bud, Miller, Oly, and Lite. In the film's classic opening sequence
          - J. Frank Parnell (Fox Harris), the driver of a dilapidated 1964 Chevy
          Malibu sedan, was on a journey from Los Alamos, NM (the site of secret
          nuclear experiments and research) to California's Mojave Desert and
          ultimately Los Angeles. When a motorcycle cop stopped him and opened
          the trunk, despite warnings: (&quot;You don't wanna look in there&quot;),
          he was immediately vaporized down to his semi-melted, smoking leather
          boots. Parnell continued his drive
        to LA, where in another strand of the story, punk rocker Otto Maddox
        (Emilio Estevez) was introduced. He was a nihilistic,
        disaffected grocery store stock clerk who was soon unemployed, and then
        lured to work into the predatory world of automobile repossession
        by laid-back, master repo-man Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) at the  Helping
              Hand Acceptance Corporation. Shortly later while driving a repo
              car, Otto picked up activist Leila (Olivia Barash) who worked at
              the United Fruitcake Outlet - she was part of a secret underground
              network of renegades who believed in the existence of ETs or extraterrestrials
              and life in outer space. She claimed that there were bodies of
              four radioactive dead aliens being smuggled from the Los Alamos
              AF base in the trunk of the 1964 Chevy Malibu driven by one of
              the base's scientists. Her underground renegade network issued
              a $20,000 bounty 'wanted notice' for the Malibu - the reward for
              locating the car (and its trunk's contents). Meanwhile, the sickened
              lunatic Los Alamos scientist Parnell - driving the Chevy Malibu,
           arrived in LA, where he was pursued by a variety of deranged characters,
              including government agents. Otto  was picked up by lobotomized &quot;loonie&quot; Parnell
              (whose mind was 'eroding') who offered him a hitched ride in the
              Malibu. Soon after, Parnell passed out and died from radiation
              sickness due to prolonged exposure. The film's crazed and climactic
              conclusion consisted of many twists and turns regarding the car's
              possession (when many of the characters reconverged). Otto was
              eventually reunited with Bud back at the Helping Hand repossession
              lot where Bud  was sitting in the glowing, bright-green
              Malibu. Otto warned him to be sensible: &quot;Only
              an asshole gets killed over a car.&quot;  The defiant Bud, who
               attempted to defend his claim to the car, was machine-gunned
              by a sniper-agent in a circling helicopter and then died in Otto's
              arms. The Malibu (with sparks) emitted a mysterious, blinding light
              force field and held back or incinerated anyone who approached
              close. In the film's final moments, Helping Hand mechanic Miller
              (a believer in aliens - a time traveler?) was easily able to slide
              behind the wheel to go for a &quot;spin&quot; and
        summoned Otto to join him as a passenger. During a euphoric, cosmic
              drive for both Miller and Otto, the car  miraculously levitated,
              sped away across the LA skyline, and then blasted into interplanetary
              outer space. </font></p>        </td>

            This well-crafted drama that examined racial hatred was set in 1944
            (during World War II) at Fort Neal, a segregated Southern military
            post and base for black platoons. In the shocking opening, hated
            tyrannical black drill instructor Master Sergeant Vernon Waters (Adolph
            Caesar) was found shot to death (with a .45 caliber pistol) outside
            the base on a road in the town of Tynen, Louisiana. During the investigation
            (told through various interrogations and flashbacks) by tough, serious
            African-American attorney Captain Davenport (Howard E. Rollins) brought
            down from Washington, DC, it was at first thought that the drunken
            Waters was killed by white officers or the Ku Klux Klan, but they
            were quickly ruled out. Davenport faced many obstacles in his investigation:
            deceit, prejudice, lack of cooperation, a resistant chain of command,
            and black troops who were afraid to talk. Commanding officer Colonel
            Nivins (Trey Wilson) limited Davenport's official inquiry to only
            three days. Many of those questioned, including a number of fellow
            soldiers (black and white), had a motive to kill Waters. Davenport
            discovered that the unpopular Waters had denounced illiterate, 
			guitar-strumming &quot;Geechee&quot; C. J. Memphis (Larry Riley) 
			as a shameful example of the black race:
          &quot;The Black race can't afford you no more. There used to be a time,
          we'd see someone like you singin', clownin', yassuh-bossin'... and
          we wouldn't do anything. Folks liked that. You were good. Homey kind
          of nigger. When they needed somebody to mistreat, call a name or two,
          they paraded you. Reminded them of the good old days. Not no more.
          The day of the Geechee is gone, boy. And you're going with it.&quot; Waters
          had brought trumped-up charges against Memphis, who was later driven
          to suicide (by hanging) in his cell while awaiting trial. Davenport
          also learned that only MPs and soldiers on special duty were given
          .45 ammunition. It was revealed that Waters was
          killed by unrepentant and militant Pvt. First Class Peterson (Denzel
          Washington) who explained that he killed Waters in revenge for driving
          C.J. Memphis to suicide. Peterson confessed: &quot;I didn't kill much.
          Some things need gettin' rid of. Man like Waters never did nobody
          no good, Cap'n.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Jim Jarmusch<br />
              Jim Jarmusch's minimalist, odd-ball, stark B/W indie road film
              - his breakthrough film - was only his second feature. The influential,
              low-budget, deadpan comedy mixed the feel of a Jack Kerouac road
              film, a <i>Waiting for Godot</i>-like script written by Samuel
              Beckett, post-beatnik hipster 'coolness', and the glacial pace
              of an Andy Warhol movie. Although essentially
              plotless (but providing a timeless, insightful snapshot of the
              80s), the film's main stylistic message was the aimless, uncommunicative,
              boring, and listless goals of its main characters who nevertheless
              formed a compelling, tight affectionate bond with each other. It
              followed the aimless, slacker and boring lifestyle of small-time
              gambler Willie (John Lurie) and his misfit hustler buddy Eddie
              (Richard Edson) in three settings or locations, which delineated
              the three-part film: NY, Cleveland, and Miami. They were on a disaffected,
              pointless, and low-key search for some kind of paradise. After
              Willie spent 10 days with his teenaged Eva (Eszter Balint), a distant
              Hungarian cousin who impressed him by shoplifting, he and Eddie
              visited her a year later in Ohio during a stark winter, and she
              joined them for an off-kilter trek to the tacky world of Miami
              where the film ended in a bizarre fashion as they parted ways. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: James Cameron<br />
              See <a href="series-terminator.html"><em>Terminator</em></a> series.<br />
              Director James Cameron's tech-noir, action-packed, low budget,
              beautifully-paced, original science-fiction film  starred 36 year-old
              Arnold Schwarzenegger in his breakout role, portraying an invulnerable,
              ruthless, assassin-terminator cyborg. In the opening, a future-world
              of a dark, ruined post-apocalyptic Los Angeles AD 2029 was
              portrayed; AI machines ruled the
              desolate world, led by a computer network called Skynet;  massive
              machines were programmed to hunt down humans in order to exterminate
              the entire human race.  A time traveler materialized 
		  in Los Angeles of 1984 - a  &quot;Terminator&quot; (Arnold Schwarzenegger);
		  the crouching, muscle-bound, powerfully-strong figure materialized
		  nude; it was an indestructible android assassin - a humanoid-shaped
		  T-800 Series (Model 101)  with a human tissue exterior
		  and a cold chromium/metallic, skeletal interior. A second time-traveling
		  individual named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a soldier of the Tech-Com
		  human Resistance movement of the future (led by Resistance leader John
		  Connor) that was fighting against Skynet, was also teleported back.
		  Both were on a systematic search to hunt down a female named 'Sarah
		  Connor' for unspecified but different reasons. The
            first killing machine mistook two other 'Sarah Connors' located in
		  a Los Angeles telephone book for the real one. Worried about her
        safety, the 'real' Sarah (Linda Hamilton) ventured to the crowded Tech-Noir
		  bar/night-club, where during a shootout in the bar/nightclub,  Reese
		  saved defenseless Sarah from being killed by  the Terminator. He  
	    convinced Sarah that he was there to protect her. During their escape,
		   Reese explained his mission and the reason for the Terminator's relentless
		  quest to kill her; the Terminator was an assassin - a Model 101 android
		  (or cyborg) created by Cyberdyne Systems. Reese had come back from
		  45 years into the future to protect her. He described  one brave Resistance
		  fighter-leader and rebel-soldier named John Connor, Sarah's future
		  unborn son, who would eventually become a liberator and lead the revolt
		  against the evil machines to prevent the world from being annihilated.
		  His quest, therefore, was to rescue and save innocent Sarah's life
              and ensure the conception and delivery of her son who would form
        the Resistance movement. Criminal psychologist
        Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen) regarded Reese's complete
        story as the paranoid, insane delusions of a psychopath. To continue
        his assault on Reese and Sarah, the Terminator approached the  heavily
        guarded CENTRAL DIVISION of the LA police department where the two were
        being held, and briefly promised the desk officer: &quot;I'll be back.&quot; He
        rammed into the station with his vehicle to initiate a vicious shoot-out
        sequence in which he assaulted and completely destroyed the police station,
        as the two fugitives successfully fled to a rented room in the Tiki Motel.
        Reese mentioned an old faded and torn picture of her that John Connor
        had given him, and that he had vowed to come across time for her; he
        boldly asserted his love for her: &quot;I came across time for you, Sarah.
        I love you. I always have&quot;; in an affecting love scene (to the accompaniment
        of piano music), they clenched and held hands together, and their love-making
        conceived the future liberator John Connor. Soon after, the Terminator
        pursued after their pickup truck on a motorcycle. After a violent crash,
        the T-800 was run over by a massive JG Oil company tanker-truck, but
        he was able to commander the tanker, that was shortly later blown up
        by one of Reese's pipe bombs. Kyle and Sarah watched in disbelief  at
        the unstoppable android's gleaming metal/chrome exo-skeletal frame (with
        glowing red eyes) that rose up from the fiery debris and gazed directly
        back at them. The film concluded  inside  a large factory building
        filled with giant GMF robotic, hydraulic-powered machines. During a tense
        chase, the self-sacrificing Kyle  placed his last homemade pipe-bomb
        into the Terminator's open rib-cage or torso, successfully blowing its
        lower half away, but also killing himself. The upper-half torso of the
        battered but relentless android survived and continued its pursuit of
        Sarah. She lured it underneath a massive hydraulic press
        and crushed it. In the film's  short epilogue, a 6-months
        pregnant Sarah recorded her audio thoughts for her unborn future child.
        At a gas station in Mexico, a Polaroid picture was taken of her by
        a young Mexican boy (Anthony Trujillo) -- it was the same exact picture
        given by Connor to Kyle Reese that he had carried with him and fallen
        in love with. The circularity of the film's paradox seemed complete.
        The  Mexican boy forecast an impending storm.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>This Is Spinal Tap (1984), </b>82 minutes,
              D: Rob Reiner<br />
            Director Rob Reiner's debut film was one of the funniest, improvisational
            parodies and satirical mockumentaries ever made. It was a typical
            concert film about the ill-fated, 1982 <em>Tap
            Across America</em> tour by Spinal Tap - one of Europe's loudest
          bands, in their first US tour in six years. The
          film featured non-stop hilarity, mixing both obvious gags and lampooning
          in-jokes, as well as many brief star cameos, like Billy Crystal as
          angry head waiter Morty the Mime, Fran Drescher as tough record company
          publicist Bobbi Flekman (&quot;Money talks, and bulls--t walks!&quot;),
          Bruno Kirby as a limo driver, and Patrick MacNee as the vacuous Sir
          Denis Eton-Hogg, head of Polymer Records and Hoggwood, a camp for pale
          young boys. The film's most famous scene was
          the explanation of how the band's Marshall amplifier was special: &quot;These
          go to 11.&quot; Fictional director Marty
            DiBergi (Rob Reiner, the film's actual director)
            followed the members of the second-rate, fictitious heavy metal band
            as they promoted their new LP album <em>Smell the Glove</em>: blonde
            lead singer David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), the cucumber-wearing
            bass player Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel
            (Christopher Guest) - who seemed to long for St. Hubbins, Viv Savage
            (David Kaff) - a strange troll-like keyboardist, and their shifty-eyed,
            cricket stick-wielding manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). There had
            been an endless string of mortal drummers (one was remembered as
            having choked to death on someone else's vomit, while another spontaneously
            combusted). The group had numerous tour misadventures: they couldn't
            locate  the amphitheatre stage for a performance in Cleveland,
            were stopped at security for wearing &quot;artificial limbs,&quot; experienced
            show cancellations, non-existent hotel accommodations, mechanical
            failures, second billing to a puppet show, an 18&quot; Stonehenge
            props debacle, failed promotional appearances, and David's Yoko Ono-like
            girlfriend Jeanine Pettibone (June Chadwick) attempted to break up
        the band. </font></p>        </td>
