              Julie Taymor<br />
              Director Julie Taymor's countercultural, drug-laden 1960s-era musical
              romance was laced with almost three dozen iconic and thematic Beatles
              songs, as it followed the story of two lovers from widely-different
              backgrounds: Jude (Jim Sturgess) and high-school senior Lucy Carrigan
              (Evan Rachel Wood) - both had names (as did others) inspired by
              the song titles. Jude was a poor shipyard worker from Liverpool,
              who came to America (New Jersey), to locate his estranged father,
              by enlisting in the Merchant Navy. He found his  American
              GI father Wesley &quot;Wes&quot; Hubert
              (Robert Clohessy) - working as a janitor at Princeton University,
              and also met Lucy's rebellious brother Max Carrigan (Joe Anderson),
              a student at the school. Through Max and his affluent, upper-class
              suburban family, Jude met Max's sister Lucy when he attended the
              family's Thanksgiving Dinner. They were attracted to each other
              although both had other relationships. Lucy's HS boyfriend Daniel
              (Spencer Liff) was serving in Vietnam. After Max announced he was
              dropping out of school, he and Jude moved to NYC and lived together
              for a short time in a Greenwich Village enclave, where Max worked
              as a taxi driver and Jude was a freelance visual artist. Jude and
              Lucy (after Daniel's death) fell in love after they spent time
              together, while Max was drafted into the Army and deployed to Vietnam.
              The pair befriended a small group of musicians, including guitarist
              Jo-Jo (Martin Luther McCoy) and Sadie (Dana Fuchs), and two other
              quirky characters while on a psychedelic cross-country bus trip:
              drug guru Dr. Robert (Bono) and Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard) who ran
              a bizarre circus. Lucy became dedicated to the anti-war movement
              and the violent protest  group Students for a Democratic
              Republic (SDR), causing a rift between Jude and Lucy that led to
              their breakup on the day of MLK's assassination in 1968. After
              being arrested when caught in an anti-war protest, Jude was deported
              back to Liverpool (due to his illegal entry into the US), but he
              was able to return legally to be reconciled with Lucy, when they
              came together in a dramatic and emotional scene set across two
              NYC rooftops. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward
          Robert Ford (2007)</strong>, 160 minutes, D: Andrew Dominik<br />
          This highly-acclaimed, historically-accurate, epic-length psychological
          western retold the story of charismatic, frontier Missouri fugitive
          outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt), and his devoted older brother Frank
          James (Sam Shepard). The two brothers were joined
          in their gang by Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell), who eventually convinced
          the reluctant James' brothers to take on his younger brother,  19
          year-old 'sidekick' Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Ford (Casey Affleck). At
          the time of 34 year-old Jesse's death, he and Frank were planning their
          gang's  robbery of the Platte City, MO bank, while Jesse lived
          with his wife Zee (Mary-Louise Parker) and two children nearby in a
          small cottage in St. Joseph, MO. The legendary Jesse James was felled
          (shot in the back of the head after disarming himself) on the morning
          of April 3rd, 1882 in his family's home by Judas-like &quot;Bob&quot; Ford.
          Many motivations were suggested for the assassination - jealousy, a
          desire for fame or the bounty reward, disillusionment with his idol,
          resentment or fear, and the promise of a pardon from the Governor of
          Missouri Thomas Crittenden (James Carville). After the killing, the
          Ford brothers become notorious, exploitative celebrities with a Manhattan
          theater show that re-enacted the assassination. Bob played himself,
          while older brother Charley acted as the victim Jesse James. As Jesse's
              fame as a mythic folk hero increased, the two brothers were ultimately
              undone and reviled, and Bob was mockingly labeled a &quot;coward.&quot; A
              terminally-ill case of TB caused Charley to commit suicide in May
              of 1884. Eight years later in 1892 in Colorado, the increasingly-regretful
              Bob was murdered by Edward O'Kelley (Michael Copeman) at his saloon
              - who was  pardoned ten years later after serving part of his life
              imprisonment sentence.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Atonement (2007, US/UK),</b> 123 minutes, D: Joe
              Wright<br />
Director Joe Wright's epic war film of thwarted romance extended over a period
of six decades. The film adaptation was based upon English author Ian McEwan's
best-selling 2001 novel first set in pre-WWII England. Events
early in the film had very long-lasting consequences that caused irrevocable
and permanent damage. In 1935, 13 year-old, fantasy-prone aspiring
writer Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) spied upon her lithe
older sister Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) cavorting with her
'secret' boyfriend  at her rich family's estate - the servant/cook son Robbie
Turner (James McAvoy) who was a recent Cambridge graduate. Briony (possibly willfully)
misunderstood and thought there were sexual implications when Cecilia was at
an outdoor fountain and dove underwater to retrieve a broken piece of a family
heirloom vase - and emerged almost naked in front of Robbie with her soaked and
transparent dress. She also came upon the two passionately making love against
the stacks in the estate's library. And then she wrongly accused Robbie of 'raping'
her 15 year-old visiting cousin Lola Quincey (Juno Temple), although she misidentified
him - the real rapist was  house-guest Paul Marshall (Benedict
Cumberbatch). Robbie was charged and arrested for the 'rape,' and
four years later had been pardoned and was serving in the British
Army, where he was a participant in the Dunkirk evacuation, and had become seriously
wounded. At the same time, Cecilia was a nurse during the war effort, while 18
year-old Briony (Romola Garai) was working in a London hospital. When Briony
realized that she had testified falsely about Robbie's involvement with Lola,
she went to apologize to them, but it appeared too late to have any effect. In
the film's ending set in present-day England, older, terminally-ill (with vascular
dementia) novelist Briony (Vanessa Redgrave) was interviewed about her latest
and last book - an autobiographical work titled <i>Atonement</i>,
when she confessed as an act of penance that much of the end portion
of the novel (concerning her apology) was fabricated and imaginary
about their reconciliation, since both Robbie and Cecilia died
during the war. Robbie had died of a sepsis infection at Dunkirk
before being evacuated, and Cecilia drowned as a result of  a
tube station bombing during the Blitz months later. The final idealized
scene of the lovers cavorting on the beach near a beach house,
was as Briony stated a fabricated 'happy ending': &quot;So
in the book, I wanted to give Robbie and Cecilia what they lost out
on in life. I'd like to think this isn't weakness or evasion, but
a final act of kindness. I gave them their happiness.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

              117 minutes, D: Sidney Lumet<br />
              This fatalistic crime melodrama-thriller by veteran director Sidney
              Lumet was a heist tale, told in non-linear flashback, about two
              brothers (a Cain and Abel story). The two male siblings were Andy
              Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a slobbish, bulky, smooth-talking
              and scheming but indebted New York real-estate broker-accountant,
              and Hank (Ethan Hawke), his deadbeat, divorced, weak and indecisive
              younger brother.  In
              the opening scene, Andy made vigorous love with his beautiful,
              dark-haired trophy wife Gina Hanson (Marisa Tomei) while on vacation
              in an exotic Rio hotel room. The
            two brothers master-minded a crazy (and completely botched) hold-up
            of their parents' Westchester suburban strip-mall jewelry store
            on a Saturday morning because they needed cash for debts. Hank
            needed child-support funds for his vindictive ex-wife Martha (Amy
              Ryan) and for his daughter, while Andy required money for his string
              of white-collar criminal activities, including an expensive heroin
              drug habit and male prostitutes, and to escape embezzlement charges
              by his company and the IRS. As a result of the heist, there were
              two fatalities - the brothers' masked accomplice Bobby Lasorda
              (Br&iacute;an F. O'Byrne) and Mrs. Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris),
               who happened to be filling in
              for the regular store clerk Doris. Andy
              and Hank's father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney), was determined
              to make the unidentified robbers pay for their crime for the murder
              of his wife. At the same time, restless, miserable and reckless
              Gina was having an affair with Andy's brother - she visited Hank
              on a weekly basis to have clandestine sex in his dumpy apartment.
              Hank wanted to run away with her and escape his debts and disastrous
              problems in his life, but she reminded him of his responsibilities
              (child support, his daughter, the rent, etc.). The bloody climax
              resulted in an effort to cover up the trail of evidence, or to
              silence the brothers' blackmailing creditors. Andy murdered his
               heroin dealer  (along with an innocent client),
              and also lethally shot Bobby's blackmailing brother-in-law Dex
              (Michael Shannon). Subsequently Andy was severely injured
              by Bobby's widowed wife Chris (Aleksa Palladino) and hospitalized,
              where Charles (who had been doggedly following the two brothers)
              was able to suffocate Andy to death with a pillow for his role
              in killing Nanette. </font></p>          </td>

        This action-packed spy-thriller was the 3rd film in the long-running
        franchise-series of  <a href="series-bourne.html"><em>Bourne</em></a> films.
        It was preceded by  <a href="series-bourne.html"><i>The Bourne Identity
        (2002)</i></a> and <a href="series-bourne2.html"><i>The
        Bourne Supremacy (2004)</i></a>, and followed by <i><a href="series-bourne4.html">The
        Bourne Legacy (2012)</a></i> and <i>Jason Bourne (2016)</i>. In this
        installment, super-spy   Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in
        his final appearance as Bourne) raced to attempt to find answers regarding
        his own identity in his dark past as David Webb before he became Jason
        Bourne, and how he had been trained  as a CIA assassin-killer.
        Suffering from amnesia and  numerous flashbacks, he sought to find
        information about his life prior to joining Operation Treadstone, now
        that he had become a target of a new, upgraded assassin (black ops) program
        known as Operation Blackbriar. In the film's opening set at London's
        crowded Waterloo Station, Bourne met with
        <i>London Guardian</i> journalist-reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine)
        who revealed that he had stumbled onto the existence of Blackbriar. Both
        of them were pursued by Blackbriar sniper-assassin Paz (&Eacute;dgar Ram&iacute;rez), and
        Ross lost his life. While being hunted previously by CIA Deputy Director
        Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) and now by the new director Noah Vosen (David
        Strathairn), Bourne's search took him from London to Madrid and then
        to Tangier and ultimately to New York City, to the location of the CIA's
        deep-cover bureau. He was aided in his search for clues by Nicky Parsons
        (Julia Stiles), his former Treadstone contact in Paris who was forced
        into hiding. In the film's climax, after deciphering his coded birthday
        (&quot;4-15-71&quot;) as a hospital address (&quot;415 East 71st St&quot;), 
		he met face-to-face with Dr.
        Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney). Hirsch was Bourne's &quot;maker&quot; - the overseer
        of Treadstone's behavior modification program, when Bourne remembered
        that Hirsch had transformed him into a CIA tool to be
        used by the agency as an indiscriminate killer after he had volunteered
        for Treadstone. Three days later, the film concluded with Bourne's escape
        (via the East River), after Operation Blackbriar had been exposed, Hirsch
        and Vosen were arrested, and a criminal investigation was opened against
        CIA Director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn).</font></p>        </td>

                (aka Le Scaphandre Et Le Papillon),</b> 112 minutes, D: Julian
                Schnabel<br />
				This awe-inspiring, yet tearjerking sad docu-drama was based upon the main protagonist's
				published 1997 memoirs. The biographical dramatic film told
				about wealthy playboy and <i>Elle</i> French
            	magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby (Mathieu Amalric) who suffered
              	a massive, debilitating stroke at the age of 43 in France that
				left him with a rare case of &quot;locked-in&quot; syndrome.
              	His mind was intact but he was almost completely paralyzed and
				unable to speak. Jean-Do glimpsed at himself in a mirror through one eye, thinking: &quot;God,
              	who's that? Me?&quot; and
            then commented internally about his shock: (&quot;I look like I came
            out of a vat of formaldehyde. How awful!&quot;). As he recovered
            but remained restricted, immobile and frustrated, he knew that  
            the active imaginations of his mind were completely trapped inside.
            He compared himself to a diver in a bulky, imprisoning and restrictive
            deep-sea suit or outfit, his body shell, although he felt his spirit
            was like a &quot;butterfly.&quot; He would often be wheeled/carried out (seen
            externally) to watch his children (unaffected by his slumped over
            torso and twisted face) playing on the French coastline beach. His
            son wiped the saliva-drool from his lip in one of the film's most
            affecting scenes. With  his speech therapist Henriette Durand (Marie-Jos&eacute;e
            Croze), he learned to communicate (and spell words, letter by letter)
            through the laborious process of blinking his left eye. Jean-Do listened
            by speaker phone to his frail, forgetful, and estranged 92 year old
            father Mr. Bauby Sr. (Max von Sydow), both of whom were trapped in
            their lives in similar ways. His father (aka Papinou) described how
            four flights of stairs were totally imprisoning: (&quot;It's
            impossible to talk like this. I forget everythng I want to say...I've
            had a thought about us. We're in the same boat. I'm stuck in this
            apartment, unable to use the stairs...You see, we're both locked
            in. You in your body, me in my apartment&quot;).
            In the final scene, Jean-Do died (from pneumonia) just ten days after
            publishing his painstakingly-written book of autobiographical memoirs,
            the film's title, composed by dictation one letter at a time. </font></p>          </td>

          Set in  1987 in  Bucharest, Romania under brutal and dictatorial Communist
              rule (with serious food rationing), this grim slice-of-life drama
              won  the Palme d'Or at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. It told
              about two loyal student roommates living together in their school's
              co-ed dormitory. Otilia Mihartescu (Anamaria Marinca) and Gabriela
              &quot;G&#259;bi&#539;a&quot;
              Dragut (Laura Vasiliu) soon faced almost insurmountable problems
              when G&#259;bi&#539;a realized
              she was  pregnant (she kept it hidden that she
              was in her second trimester). Abortions at the time were illegal,
              outlawed by the repressive state and punishable by death. They
              were forced to procure a law-breaking termination procedure from
               male abortionist  Bebe (Vlad Ivanov). According to his instructions,
              G&#259;bi&#539;a and
              Otilia made the arrangements, including booking a 3-day reservation
              at a hotel room at the Unitea, and providing all the needed supplies
              and bribes necessary, while Otilia borrowed money from her boyfriend
              Adi Radu (Alex Potocean). The situation intensified when the location
              of the procedure was changed to a more expensive hotel, the Tineretului,
              and Adi insisted that Otilia attend his mother's birthday party
              on the same night. More problematic was Bebe's insistence that
              in addition to money, he would be compensated with sexual favors
              from both roommates. After the illegal abortion was performed 
              by injecting a probe and a saline solution  into G&#259;bi&#539;a's
              uterus, Bebe departed with instructions on how to dispose
              of the fetus. After forced attendance by Otilia at Adi's family
              celebration, she returned to the hotel and  disposed
              of the fetus (in a bag deposited in another building's trash chute)
              before joining a recovered G&#259;bi&#539;a in the hotel's restaurant,
              for a late-night dinner (ordering from a wedding party's menu).
              Otilia noted: &quot;We're never going to talk about this, okay?&quot; There
              were clues throughout the film that Otilia was pregnant, but not
              aware of the fact. </font><font size="2"><br />

            Affleck <br />
          Director Ben Affleck's feature-film directorial debut was this mystery
          thriller-crime drama, based upon Dennis Lehane's 1998 novel of the
          same name. In the tough working-class neighborhood of Dorchester
          near Boston, MA, it was reported that the 4-year-old
          daughter Amanda (Madeline O'Brien) of  ignorant, cocaine-addicted
          mother Helene  McCready (Amy Ryan) had been abducted. A private
          investigator-detective from the neighborhood, who had  unique criminal
          connections to the Boston underworld, 31 year-old Patrick
          Kenzie (Casey Affleck), explained
          in the opening that his job was to find people that had gone missing
          in his hometown. He was hired along with his business and personal
          partner-girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), to find the
           kidnapped girl (with her favorite
          doll Mirabelle - actually Annabelle). They were recruited by the girl's
          Aunt and Uncle, Beatrice &quot;Bea&quot; McCready (Amy Madigan) and
          Lionel McCready (Titus Welliver). Other police officers were assigned
          to the case, including shady veteran Det. Sgt. Remy Bressant (Ed Harris)
          and his partner Nick Poole (John Ashton), while police Captain Jack
          Doyle (Morgan Freeman) oversaw the investigation. Patrick and Angie
          entered into a seamy world involving drug smugglers, a Haitian drug
          dealer, a murderous child-molesting pedophile, cocaine addicts, career
          criminals and corrupt cops. As it turned out, Amanda's kidnapping (and
          her death) had been faked at a quarry during a botched exchange, and
          she was soon after found living happily with Captain Doyle and his
          wife. The couple had suffered the kidnapping and murder of their own
          child years before. Doyle was unable to convince Patrick to let the
          case go unsolved: &quot;I did what I did for the sake of the child.&quot; 
		  The film ended on a sad note, with Amanda returning to her irresponsible and negligent
          mother, and the arrest of Doyle and Uncle Lionel for conspiring to
          stage a fake kidnapping. Due to a strong difference of opinion about
          Amanda's fate, Patrick and Angie broke up.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Hairspray (2007),</b> 115 minutes, D: Adam Shankman<br />
            This fun and exhilarating comedic musical with an ensemble cast was
                based on two sources: the 2002 hit Broadway stage musical, and
                director John Waters' non-musical camp comedy <i>Hairspray
          (1988)</i>. Set in 1962 in Baltimore, MD, the charming film followed
          the aspirations and dreams of plump, optimistic 16 year-old
          HS student Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky in her film debut), who wished
          to try out on the local, after-school WYZT-TV teen dance show, <i>The
          Corny Collins Show</i> (modeled
          after Dick Clark's <i>American Bandstand</i>). Although she was pro-integration,
          she loved to watch the mostly white dance show every afternoon,  hosted
          by Corny (James Marsden). She had a crush on the show's lead dance
          star, Link Larkin (Zac Efron), who was featured with his pretty girlfriend
          and partner Amber von Tussle (Brittany Snow) - both teens attended
          Tracy's HS. Amber was the favored daughter of icy-cold ex-pageant queen
          Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), the  racist manager
          of the dance show who insisted it remain almost entirely segregated.
          The show was sponsored by Ultra-Clutch brand hairspray. Tracy's parents,
          obese and agorophobic Mrs. Turnblad (John Travolta in drag!), the owner
          of a laundry business, and her father Wilbur (Christopher Walken),
          the owner of a practical-joke shop known as &quot;Hardy-Har
          Hut&quot;, weren't altogether supportive of their daughter. Tracy's best HS friend was
          Penny Lou Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), the daughter of highly-religious
          fundamentalist and racist Prudence &quot;Prudy&quot; Pingleton
          (Allison Janney). Tracy's favorite part of the show was the once-a-month
           &quot;Negro Day&quot; specials (on the last Tuesday of the month), when African-American
          dancers participated, and the show was hosted by R&amp;B DJ Motormouth
          Maybelle (Queen Latifah), a record shop manager. While auditioning
          for an open spot on the show, Tracy became friends with Maybelle's
          son Seaweed J. Stubbs (Elijah Kelley), a great dancer who taught her
          some slick dance moves. Once Tracy was selected to be on the show,
          she caused conflict when she announced that she wished every show could
          be &quot;Negro Day,&quot; but then the outspoken teen became extremely popular.
          She emerged as Amber's rival for the title of &quot;Miss Teenage Hairspray,&quot;
          and also a contender for Link's attention. Tracy was also able to encourage
          her mother to leave the house and become her agent-manager. A protest
          developed when Velma dropped the &quot;Negro Day&quot; show, and members of the
          cast joined a march against the studio to promote the show's integration.
          In the meantime, romantic relationships developed between Tracy and
          Link, and Seaweed and Prudy. In the climax during Velma's rigged pageant
          competition for &quot;Miss Teenage Hairspray,&quot; the outcast Tracy broke in
          and performed. She was joined onstage with Link dancing with Seaweed's
          teenaged younger sister Little Inez (Taylor Parks), who eventually
          was voted as the winner - and lead dancer. Tracy had succeeded in integrating
          the show, while Velma was fired.</font></p>        </td>

                  Rising (2007)</a>,</strong> 121 minutes, D: Peter Webber<br />
                  This psychological horror-thriller was the 5th installment
                  of the popular franchise-series of
				   <a href="series-hannibal.html"><em>Hannibal</em></a> films
                  (1986-2007) about the sinister, cannibalistic serial killer
                  Hannibal Lecter. It was based on Thomas Harris' prequel novel
                  of the same name published in 2006. Set first in Lithuania
                  during WWII, it followed the early life of young 8 year-old
                  Hannibal (Aaran Thomas as boy, Gaspard Ulliel as adult) living
                  in a medieval Lecter castle, when he witnessed his well-to-do
                  parents Count Lecter and Simonetta Sforza-Lecter (Richard Leaf
                  and Ingeborga Dapkunaite) and younger sister Mischa (Helena
                  Lia Tachovska) die during conflict between Soviet and German
                  soldiers. He became haunted by the memory of six starving Lithuanian
                  militiamen who deserted and joined the German Waffen-SS, and
                  then were responsible for cannibalizing his beloved Mischa.
                  Traumatized and rendered mute, he was transferred to a Soviet-run
                  orphanage (once his family's castle) for eight years, and then
                  escaped to live in France with his widowed Aunt by marriage,
                  Japanese wartime survivor Lady Murasaki Shikibu (Gong Li),
                  the author of <i>The Tale of Genji</i>. To defend
                  his Aunt's honor, he assaulted and then later brutally killed
                  (with a katana) a crude and racist butcher Paul Momund (Charles
                  Maquignon) who had slighted her. He developed his signature
                  obsession - biting a victim's cheeks. Lady Murasaki helped
                  to hide Hannibal's crime from Inspector Popil (Dominic West).
                  She taught him martial arts, while he also entered medical
                  school and became an academically-gifted medical student working
                  with cadavers. For the rest of his time in Europe, the increasingly-psychotic
                  Lecter plotted to seek vengeance on the murderous war criminals
                  (the six German killers identified through their dogtags) who
                  had animalistically eaten Mischa. He sought and viciously killed
                  each of them in this order: Kazys Porvik (Lecter witnessed him crushed
                  by falling debris), Enrikas Dortlich (decapitation), Zigmas
                  Milko (drowning and incineration), Petras Kolnas (impalement
                  - head stabbing), Vladis Grutas (lethal chest carving and explosion),
                  and Bronys Grentz (beheaded in Canada). During his lethal confrontation
                  with Grutas, Lecter was told that he had also consumed
                  his sister in broth that was fed to him by the deserters, and
                  that his excuse for retribution was to keep it a secret.
                  After the 6th and final murder, Lecter  moved
                  to the US to continue his rampage. A number of years passed
                  before events in  the next film <i>Manhunter (1986)</i>, based
          upon Thomas Harris'  1981 novel <i>Red Dragon</i>.</font></p>          </td>

                  minutes, D: David Yates<br />
        This feature-length episode was the 5th installment of the long-running
        8-film  <a href="series-harrypotter.html"><em>Harry
        Potter</em></a> franchise-series. The fantasy-adventure film, based upon
        J.K. Rowling's 2003 novel of the same name, was preceded by <a href="series-harrypotter4.html"><i>Harry
        Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)</i></a>, and followed by <a href="series-harrypotter6.html"><i>Harry
        Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)</i></a>. In the story, Hogwarts
        wizard-in-training student Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) was about
        to begin his 5th year of studies. It was prophesied by the secret Order
        of the Phoenix, founded by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)
        to oppose  Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), that the evil one had returned,
        but the corrupt Ministry of Magic and its head Cornelius Fudge (Robert
        Hardy) were denying the fact. Fudge believed that Dumbledore was using
         claims of The Dark Lord's return as a means to over-throw Fudge as Minister.
        15 year-old Harry and his cousin Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) were
        attacked by Dementors in 1995 in their SE England home-town of Little
        Whinging, contradicting the current prevailing rumors. Harry was also
        plagued by nightmares of Voldemort's menacing return. His new Defense
        Against the Dark Arts teacher, pink-costumed Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge
        (Imelda Staunton), under the influence of the Ministry, assumed cruel
        bureaucratic and authoritative control of Hogwarts, using dictatorial
        and fascist powers when appointed as the new Headmistress to quell dissent
        (after Dumbledore had fled following threats of arrest). Smear tactics
        were employed against those who believed in the ominous predictions of
        You Know Who's return by <i>The Daily Prophet</i>. To defend themselves,
        Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Harry
        recruited and formed a secretive defensive group of students known as
        &quot;Dumbledore's Army&quot; (DA), to teach combative magical spells. Counteracting
        the DA to expose them were students recruited by Umbridge to form an
        Inquisitorial Squad - composed of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and other
        Slytherin students. Meanwhile, Harry was forming a romantic relationship
        with Cho Chang (Katie Leung). Another development was the escape from
        Azkaban prison by Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Sirius
        Black's (Gary Oldman) deranged Death Eater cousin, along with nine other
        Death Eaters. In the film's climactic battle, all forces met to confront
        each other in the Department of Mysteries: Death Eaters (Lucius Malfoy
        (Jason Isaacs) and Bellatrix Lestrange and others) vs. Dumbledore's Army
        joined by Sirius Black and members of the Order of the Phoenix. Tragically,
        Bellatrix killed Sirius (Harry's godfather), just before Dumbledore magically
        arrived to duel against Voldemort to save Harry. In the conclusion, Minister
        Fudge admitted his errors and resigned, followed by Umbridge's removal
        as Headmistress and Dumbledore's reinstatement.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Into the Wild (2007),</b> 148 minutes, D: Sean
              Penn<br />
Director/writer Sean Penn's documentary-styled, ill-fated odyssey and biopic
    adventure-drama was based upon Jon Krakauer's 1996 non-fiction book - about
    a quest for self-discovery. The film opened with a concluding sequence, titled
    'Final Chapter: Getting of Wisdom.' Free-spirited, idealistic,
              arrogant college-grad adventurer Christopher McCandless (Emile
              Hirsch) (who had renamed himself &quot;Alexander
            Supertramp&quot;) arrived at a remote portion of Alaska in 1992 after forsaking
          his estranged family and many friends along his wanderlust journey.
            There, he set up a camp inside an abandoned
            city bus (&quot;The Magic Bus&quot;), where he began to live a life
            of isolation, diary-writing, and hunting for sustenance. A flashback
            returned to two years earlier, when he graduated from Emory University
            in Atlanta, GA. He  was quickly disillusioned by modern and
            'corrupt' civilization (after he learned he had been born out-of-wedlock).
            He began a cross-country drive that ended near Las Vegas where he
            abandoned his car and began hitchhiking. He wandered to N. California,
            then back to South Dakota, down to Mexico, and west to Los Angeles,
            taking odd jobs and having various misadventures. On the S. California
            border with Mexico in the Sonoran Desert, he had a brief
            encounter at an RV park with teenaged Tracy Tatro (Kristen Stewart),
            a guitar player who was introduced to him as &quot;little
              Joni Mitchell&quot; - and he spent an enjoyable but brief time with her. 
			  He also met up, a month later at the Salton Sea (California) with kindly, elderly
              widower and leather worker Ron Franz (Oscar-nominated Hal Holbrook).
              After climbing up to a rocky hilltop, they talked about where
              to find human happiness: (&quot;From
              the bits and pieces I've put together, you know, from what you
              told me about your family, your mother and your dad, and I know
              you've got your problems with the church too, but there's some
              kind of bigger thing we can all appreciate, and it sounds like
              you don't mind calling it God. But when you forgive, you love,
              and when you love, God's light shines on you&quot;). Two months
              later, in a tearful and heartfelt parting scene just before Ron
              dropped off hitchhiking 'Alex' at the start of his Alaskan adventure,
              he proposed paternalistically to adopt 'Alex' as his grandchild:
              (&quot;You know, my, uh, my mother was an only child and so was my father,
              and, uh, I was their only child, so, uh, when I'm gone, I'm the
              end of the line. My family will be finished. What do you say you
              let me adopt you? I can be, say, your grandfather&quot;). 
            Unfortunately, 'Alex' demurred: &quot;Ron,
            could we talk about this when I get back from Alaska? Would that
            be okay?&quot; - they would never have another opportunity to speak. In the
          final scene in a flash-forward to four months later in Alaska, Chris
          suffered a prolonged, lonely, and painful death due to starvation and
          poisoning after eating inedible Wild Sweet Peas (mistaken for Wild
          Potato Alaska Carrot) . His final words were scrawled in block letters
          into his journal: &quot;HAPPINESS
        ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED.&quot; When he died, the  camera pulled back 
        from his face (as a single tear dropped from the corner of his right
        eye and then his left eye) as he gazed up at the light in the back of
        his abandoned 'magic bus' home (an IH 1946 abandoned bus). Two weeks
        later, his body was found by moose-hunters. The film ended with an actual
        self-portrait photograph of Chris sitting next to his bus. </font></p>        </td>

              Drake<br />
              In this teen, coming-of-age romantic comedy-drama, each of the
              four sections of the film were divided by the seasons of the year.
              Starting in Autumn, the title character Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page),
              an offbeat, precocious, sarcastic, independent-minded, 16 year-old
              junior living in Minnesota was facing an unexpected pregnancy after
              having one-time sex (in a rocking chair) with her geeky but genuine
              best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). A visit to an abortion
              clinic convinced Juno to carry the baby to term and then adopt
              the child out. The pragmatic Juno perused the <i>PennySaver</i> personal
              ads, and contacted a childless couple - two upscale yuppies (including
              a failed rock star) who were ideally suitable as potential parents
              for a closed adoption: commercial ad jingle-writer Mark and Vanessa
              Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). She met what she thought
              was the perfect couple in their luxury suburban home. She also
              notified her supportive parents: Mac (J. K. Simmons) and stepmother
              Bren MacGuff (Allison Janney) of her decision, and then continued
              on with her schooling. A number of complications and challenges
              arose through the months, including Paulie's ignored feelings about
              being a father and how he was casually neglected by Juno, and Juno's
              close association with Mark with whom she shared an interest in
              punk rock and horror films. Just before the baby was due, Mark
              confided in Juno the shocking revelation that he was planning to
              divorce and leave Vanessa, that he wasn't ready to be a father,
              and that he had emotional feelings for Juno. She was disturbed
              that her dream of the baby being raised in a loving family might
              not come to fruition. Juno came to the realization that she really
              loved Paulie and they both expressed their true and honest love
              for each other. Following the birth of a baby boy, Vanessa came
              to the hospital to happily claim the newborn  as a single adoptive mother. 
			  Juno's note to Vanessa,
              displayed in the newborn's nursery, stated:  &quot;Vanessa: If
              you're still in, I'm still in. - Juno.&quot; Meanwhile, Juno and
              Paulie maintained their open and happy relationship at school. </font></p>        </td>

        This action-thriller was the fourth film in the five-film  <a href="series-diehard.html"><em>Die
        Hard</em></a> franchise series (1988-2013). On the 4th of July holiday
        weekend, NYC police detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) was called
        upon to stop cyber-terrorists who were hacking into various networked
        computers across the country, including the FBI's Cybercrime division.
        With the help of an apprehended young hacker named Matthew &quot;Matt&quot; Farrell
        (Justin Long) (who himself was targeted for assassination) and FBI agent
        Miguel Bowman (Cliff Curtis) in the Cybersecurity Division, McClane learned
        that the lead criminal mastermind (who was killing his own hackers to
        cover his tracks, including Farrell) was Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant).
        Gabriel was assisted by lover-girlfriend Mai Linh (Maggie Q) and Rand
        (Cyril Raffaelli).  He had learned his cyber-skills when he worked
        as a top security expert for the U.S. Department of Defense, before being
        dismissed and going rogue. His  objective was to instigate a
        high-tech attack on the US'  infrastructure, to disable
        and cripple everything and threaten the US. His main targets were designed
        to be destroyed in stages, including the nation's transportation grids
        (the network of traffic signals, rail transport and air traffic control)
        and the nation's financial systems (i.e., the stock market), to create
        a &quot;fire sale.&quot; He followed that with the sabotage
        of  telecommunications networks (the nation's TV signals). Then, he
        assaulted the power grid at a main superstation power hub in West Virginia.
        After the death of Linh, Gabriel vengefully and explosively blew up the
        power station, causing a massive electricity blackout over DC and much
        of the East Coast. In order to increase the
        stakes and provide himself with bargainng power, Gabriel kidnapped
        McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy Gennero-McClane (Mary Elizabeth
        Winstead). He set out inside a semi-mobile 18-wheeler where his portable
        computer command center was operated, to begin hacking into the NSA building
        in Woodlawn, Maryland, where all of the nation's personal and financial
        records were backed up. At the last minute, Farrell was able to encrypt
        all of Gabriel's downloaded data with a secret code. McClane pursued
        Gabriel (with Farrell and Lucy seized as hostages) who fled in a van
        into a hangar. Just at the point where Farrell was forcibly compelled
        to divulge the encryption code, McClane arrived. He was shot in the right
        shoulder by Gabriel's last remaining henchman, but then shot himself
        through his own shoulder wound to kill Gabriel standing behind him, before
        the FBI rescue team arrived.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Michael Clayton (2007),</b> 119 minutes, D: Tony
          Gilroy<br />
          In writer Tony Gilroy's directorial debut film, Michael Clayton (George
          Clooney) was a ruthless, high-powered former prosecutor turned troubled &quot;fixer&quot; corporate
          lawyer (or &quot;special counsel&quot;) in New York for Kenner, Bach
          and Ledeen (headed by Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack)). His job was &quot;janitor&quot; -
          to clean up various problems and keep high-paying clients out of trouble,
          although he had problems of his own: a divorce, gambling addiction
          to poker, and a remaining debt of $75,000 (for a sour deal regarding
          a failed restaurant business) that he was struggling to pay off for
          his alcoholic brother Timmy Clayton (David Lansbury). The film opened
          with issues involving the law firm's involvement in a multi-billion-dollar
          class-action lawsuit (that was about to be settled pre-trial) against
          their client, an agro-chemical company named U/North. The company was
          accused of using a cancer-causing pesticide, and there were additional
          problems with the firm's top litigator -- unstable, guilt-ridden defense
          lawyer Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson). Edens had been working on the
          U/North case for 6 years and suffered a ranting/raving breakdown during
          a deposition in the case in Milwaukee when he stopped taking his medications.
          Also, Clayton found himself in a deadly predicament when there was
          a failed car-bombing designed to kill him. The key to the film was
          that Edens was planning to sabotage the pre-trial settlement of the
          lawsuit with U/North's ruthless chief in-house counsel Karen Crowder
          (Tilda Swinton), by distributing large numbers of red-bound copies
          of a confidential scientific report (Memorandum # 229). The report,
          from one of U-North's own internal research teams (and signed by CEO
          Don Jefferies (Ken Howard)), told about the hazardous effects of human
          exposure to the weed killer involved in the lawsuit. Edens had been
          persuaded to turn against U/North (and blow the case) by one of the
          young plaintiffs in the case - a farm-girl named Anna (Merritt Wever),
          with whom he had became infatuated. To stifle Edens, Crowder had hired
          henchmen to track and spy on Arthur's phone-calls and whereabouts -
          and then to kill him - by faking his suicidal death from an overdose
          (by injecting him between the toes). They also plotted to kill Michael
          with a car bomb, because he was suspicious that Arthur didn't leave
          a suicide note at the scene, and that Arthur was on his way to meet
          Anna at the airport on the same evening he died. In
          the film's final scene, U/North's Karen Crowder calmly assured her
          executives at a board meeting about the impending successful settlement
          of the lawsuit. Then outside in the hallway, she was surprised by 
          a live confrontation by Michael Clayton - not dead from the car-bomb
          but quite alive. He blackmailed her, proposing that he could be bought
          off for $10 million to keep quiet (&quot;$10 million dollars, bank
          of my choosing, offshore, immediately!&quot;). She agreed (&quot;You
          have a deal&quot;),
          but didn't realize that he had secretly broadcast their conversation
          about her agreement to provide  hush money. He then told her: &quot;You're
          f--ked&quot; - after which he snapped her picture with his cellphone's camera
          and then identified himself: &quot;I'm Shiva, the God of Death.&quot; As
          she collapsed to the floor, she was arrested by Michael's police
          detective brother Raymond (Kevin Hagan), who had heard everything.
          The end credits played over Michael Clayton's $50 drive around
          town (&quot;Just drive&quot;) in a taxi, viewed in a long-held shot.</font></p>        </td>

              Joel and Ethan Coen<br />
              In this Coen Brothers' dark crime-thriller drama, the Best Picture-winner
        of the year,   in June of 1980 in a border area of Texas and Mexico,
               local cowboy, welder and Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin)
              came upon the bloody aftermath of a bad heroin drug deal and shoot-out
              in the desert, and discovered $2 million in drug funds cash. A
              second enigmatic, psychotic, and notorious hitman-killer Anton
              Chigurh (Javier Bardem), whose signature weapon was a high pressure
              air pistol used to indiscriminatingly kill, escaped from being
              jailed after strangling the deputy sheriff (Zach Hopkins). Hired
              to retrieve the money, he was known to flip a coin to determine
              a victim's fate. Both were under the purview of wise, about-to-retire,
              disillusioned and laconic Terrell County Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy
              Lee Jones), a third-generation law officer who was dismayed by
              the increasing violence and trail of carnage (it was truly &quot;no
              country for old men&quot;). Meanwhile, a Dallas businessman (Stephen
              Root), involved somehow in the drug deal, hired Carson Wells (Woody
              Harrelson), a bounty hunter, to control the &quot;situation&quot; with
              Chigurh and retrieve the money. Chigurh relentlessly tracked after
              Moss and engaged in a number of confrontations and gun firefights,
              killing Wells and eventually killing Moss at a motel in El Paso,
              TX. In the final shocking and chilling scene, the amoral Chigurh
              visited with Moss' recently-widowed Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald)
              who refused to play his coin-flip game, knowing his intentions
              (&quot;I ain't gonna call it.....The coin don't have no say. It's just
              you&quot;). After remorselessly killing her and leaving her house, his
              car was broadsided at an intersection and he was severely injured.
              In the final scene, retired Sheriff Bell recalled two dreams he
              had of his sheriff-father, and wistfully related them to his wife

              El Orfanato)</b>,
              105 minutes, D: Juan Antonio Bayona<br />
              This chilling gothic supernatural thriller, by first-time director
              Juan Antonio Bayona, was about an abandoned Spanish seaside orphanage,
              now restored and set up for &quot;special
          children.&quot; As a young orphaned child, now-married wife Laura 
          (Belen Rueda) had been raised at the institution.  30 years later,
          she moved in with her doctor husband Carlos Sanchez (Fernando Cayo)
          to reopen the orphanage  to help disabled children. They had one child: Sim&oacute;n
          (Roger Pr&iacute;ncep), a lonely, 7 year-old adopted son who was diagnosed
          as ill and HIV positive (dying of AIDS). Strangely, he would
          often communicate and play hide-and-seek with six imaginary &quot;invisible
          friends&quot; (or 'ghosts') in the haunted building. One
          of his imaginary &quot;ghost&quot; friends
          was named Tomas. Through Tomas, Simon claimed
          that he knew that he was adopted (although he hadn't been told) and
          that he was going to soon die. During a children's  welcoming
          party at the orphanage (during which some of the children wore masks,
          including Simon), Simon had an argument with his mother, and then inexplicably
          disappeared. That night, Laura heard unexplainable banging noises in the orphanage (noises
          coming from a blocked, closeted door under the stairs). Subsequently,
          Laura sought many ways to try and discover Simon's whereabouts, including
          a police psychologist.  During her search, Laura
          came upon evidence, through her recently-deceased social worker Benigna
          Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) who had worked at the orphanage when
          Laura was there as a child, that she had a deformed son named Tomas
          (hidden away and masked) who disappeared just like Simon.  Shortly
          after Laura's adoption, Tomas was found dead (drowned) on the beach
          after some of the other orphans had played a trick on him. Nine months
            after Simon's disappearance, Laura sought out psychic medium Aurora
            (Geraldine Chaplin) for clues to Simon's whereabouts and evidence
          of anything else in the orphanage. She was led
          to discover some ominous clues to the orphanage's sordid past - there
          were sacks of human ashes and partial skeletal remains in the orphanage's
          coal shed. [Note: Laura deduced that Benigna
          vengefully poisoned and cremated the bodies of the five children responsible
          for Tomas' death: Martin, Rita, Alicia, Guillermo, and Victor, all
          friends of Laura's, who then became 'ghosts.' Their ashes and bones
          were placed in sacks in the coal shed.] Laura's spooked husband Carlos
          left, and for two days, Laura became crazed and imagined the spirits
          of the 'ghost' children in her presence from the past. Eventually,
          the ghosts led her to discover Simon in the secret cellar/basement
          room accessible through a closet door under the stairs. [She had accidentally
          blocked the door and he perished there.] She imagined that she found
          him alive and carried him in his arms (as the camera circled them),
          but he was really dead on the floor after being trapped there many
          months earlier.  In the end, Laura took an overdose of pills to be close to her dead son,
          who came to life in her arms, as did all the other deceased children.
            When her husband Carlos returned, he walked up to the gravestone
            marker of his wife and son and the other children, to lay roses
            there. </font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Paranormal Activity (2007)</b>, 86 minutes, D: Oren
            Peli<br />
          This low-budget, breakout, independent supernatural-horror film (another
          'found footage' example, similar to the faux-documentary style of <i>The
          Blair Witch Project (1999)</i>) was director Oren Peli's highly-effective
          and successful feature debut. The chilling film came into wide
          release following a massive social-media viral marketing campaign.
          It was followed by many sequels: <i>Paranormal Activity 2 (2010), Paranormal
          Activity 3 (2011), Paranormal Activity 4 (2012), Paranormal Activity:
          The Marked Ones (2014)</i>, and<i> Paranormal
          Activity: The Ghost Dimension (2015)</i>. The
          suspenseful 'bump in the night', minimalist thriller (completely bloodless)
          was set in the fall of 2006. A  young 20-something
          couple: day-trading Micah (Micah Sloat) and his live-in teacher-girlfriend
          Katie (Katie Featherston), had just moved into a two-story suburban
          San Diego tract house. Over a three week period,  inexplicable
          late-night incidents and malevolent or 'ghostly' hauntings occurred.
          Katie believed that a malevolent, demonic force had been tormenting
          her since her childhood. With typical male bravado, Micah set up a
          night-vision camcorder that was set on a tripod
          in their bedroom, to document on videotape the mysterious nocturnal
          entity. They consulted with a famous psychic named  
          Dr. Fredrichs (Mark Fredrichs) who suggested that a demon was indeed
          targeting Katie, and that they might need professional help from  demonologist
          Dr. Johann Averies. The clueless Micah, who wasn't helping to diminish
          the nightly visits, continued to film with a battery of video cameras
          at night and was determined to solve the problem on his own. He brought home
          a Ouija board and attempted to confront the menacing forces threatening
          the entire house, further exacerbating the problem with the spirits
          whose energy was becoming increasingly angry. Ultimately, Katie (who
          had suffered a bite mark and gripped a crucifix until her hand bled)
          seemed to become demonically possessed. In the shocking and alarming
          ending, Micah's body was hurled at the video-camera and then a bloodied
          Katie walked slowly into view. She smiled at the camera and then lunged
          at it - the screen cut to black. The epilogue's title card stated:
          &quot;Micah's body was discovered by police on October 11, 2006. Katie's
          whereabouts remain unknown.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              D: Marjane Satrapi, Vincent Paronnaud<br />
Marjane Satrapi's dark, coming-of age, autobiographical animated film (nominated
for Best Animated Feature Film) was based on her best-selling graphic novels.
In the dramatic biopic film, 11 year-old Marjane (or Marji) Satrapi (voice of
Chiara Mastroianni), a big Bruce Lee fan, grew up during the 1979 Islamic revolution
(against the US-backed Shah of Iran). She was forced to survive an oppressive
regime under Ayatollah Khomeini that imposed strict and fundamentalist Islamic
law. She also suffered after the start of the Iran-Iraq war period (fought from
1980-1988) marked by rampant death and destruction. Her critically-ill uncle
Taher who had a bad heart was unable to obtain a passport to leave the country
for medical treatment, and died. As she grew older, she became more defiant and
outspoken against the government and its abuses. She was sent to a school in
Vienna, Austria in 1983, but then after a number of difficult experiences, she
returned to Iran in 1993 after the conclusion of the war. One
of her friends, Nima, fell to his death (from a rooftop) when he
tried to escape a raid on a forbidden drinking party. She visited
her imprisoned, soon-to-be executed Uncle Anouche (voice of Fran&ccedil;ois Jerosme/Iggy
Pop), an Iranian political prisoner, when he gave her a second swan made of hardened
bread crumbs, calling it &quot;the uncle&quot; of the first swan he gave her
during his first nine-year prison sentence. As she laid in bed with the
two swans, Marjane cursed God and imagined the two swans swimming out to sea.
In a  heartbreaking scene, Marjane, who had been transformed into becoming
            a major political dissident, left repressive Iran forever to live
            in Europe, and saw her Grandmother (voice of Danielle Darrieux/Gena
            Rowlands) for the last time, but she never forgot that her homeland
            was Iran. A final voice-over was of young Marjane's memories  about
            when she was told how her Grandmother kept smelling fresh: (&quot;Well,
            I'll tell you. Every morning, I pick fresh jasmine flowers, and when
            I get dressed I put them into my brassiere. That way, I smell nice
            all day&quot;). The closing credits featured falling jasmine flowers
			 (white flowers on a black background).</font></p>          </td>

                  D: Gore Verbinski <br />
        This was the third swashbuckling film in the <a href="series-piratesofcaribbean.html"><em>Pirates
        of the Caribbean</em></a>  franchise series
        of adventure-fantasy films, preceded by  <i><a href="series-piratesofcaribbean2.html">Dead
        Man's Chest (2006)</a></i>, and
        followed by <i><a href="series-piratesofcaribbean4.html">On Stranger
        Tides (2011)</a></i>. It began with pirate Captain Jack
        Sparrow (Johnny Depp) trapped in Captain Davy Jones' (Bill Nighy) Locker
        after confronting the Kraken, and in need of rescue. To help save Jack,
        Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and her fiancee Will Turner (Orlando
        Bloom) aligned themselves with resurrected and nefarious Captain Barbossa
        (Geoffrey Rush) of <i>The Black Pearl</i> and witch Tia Dalma (Naomie
        Harris) (aka Calypso, Jones' lover), to travel to the Singapore to join
        with the forces of infamous pirate lord Sao
        Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). He  possessed a ship and an important map  of the
        World's End, the gateway to Davy Jones' Locker where Sparrow was held.
        Their ultimate goal was to use The Nine Pirate Lords of the Brethren
        Court army, at all corners of the globe, to convene and then fight against
        the British. British naval forces were led by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom
        Hollander), the chairman of the East India Trading Company, and the commander
        of the <i>Endeavor</i>.
        He had taken control and enslaved the malevolent, tentacle-faced pirate
        Captain Davy Jones (by taking possession of his disembodied heart) and
        his ghostly <i>Flying Dutchman</i> crew. In addition, Admiral James Norrington
        (Jack Davenport), the former fiancee of Elizabeth, was reluctantly allied
        with Beckett, and was on his own crusade to destroy every pirate ship
        on the high seas. In the film's conclusion during a decisive and wild
        sea battle between the many forces, Will
        Turner  proposed and was married to long-time love Elizabeth on the deck
        of <i>The Black Pearl</i>. A
            few moments later, Will boarded the<i> Flying Dutchman</i> to retrieve
            the Dead Man's Chest, but was mortally stabbed in the heart by captain
            Davy Jones. Captain Jack was able to stab Jones' heart and kill him
            (using Will's hand). Legend had it that the person who stabbed Davy
            Jones' heart would become the next immortal captain of the <i>Flying
            Dutchman</i> - therefore, Will became his replacement
            (Will's heart was cut out of his body by his father &quot;Bootstrap
            Bill&quot; (Stellan Skarsgard)
          and placed in the chest). This allowed time for
          Elizabeth and Jack to escape the <i>Dutchman</i>, just as it  went
          down into a whirlpool. Will was reborn and became the new captain of
          the resurrected <i>Dutchman</i>,
              destined to sail as its captain (with his father) for eternity,
          with the crew freed from the curse and in human form. The two pirate
          ships, the <i>Pearl</i> and the <i>Dutchman</i>, destroyed Beckett's
          ship the <i>Endeavour</i> with Beckett on board. After making  love
          to Elizabeth (now Mrs. Turner) on his one day in 10 years allowed on
          land before saying a final goodbye and departure, Will
          sailed off on the <i>Dutchman</i>, leaving Elizabeth pregnant and with
          the chest containing his heart. They promised
          to see each other again in a decade. Elizabeth
        promised to keep Will's beating heart safe in the chest.</font></p>        </td>

              Jan Pinkava<br />
              This was the 8th computer-animated feature film from Disney/Pixar,
              the winner of the Best Animated Feature Film Oscar. The title 
              character of the family-oriented film was a French chef country
              rat named Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt), who could smell food ingredients
              while his gluttonous, indiscriminate, red-colored older brother
              Emile (voice of Peter Sohn) could not. Watching TV, Remy idolized
               Paris' celebrated chef Auguste Gusteau and his restaurant. Gusteau
               was the author of a best-selling cookbook titled: &quot;Anyone
              Can Cook.&quot; Remy sadly learned during one broadcast that Gusteau's
              restaurant, after the reknowned chef's death, was downgraded to
              4-stars after a poor and &quot;scathing&quot; review
              from harsh Parisian food critic Anton Ego (voice of Peter O'Toole).
              After Remy and his family of rats were driven from their country
              home by a gun-toting grandma named Mabel, he found himself in Paris
              in front of Gusteau's, now downgraded and newly owned and managed
              by short-statured, dictatorial Chef Skinner (voice of Ian Holm).
              Remy teamed up (as an odd-couple) with non-culinary-skilled, shy
              Alfredo Linguini (voice of Lou Romano) (hired as a garbage boy)
              to create culinary dishes in the restaurant. In the arrangement,
              Remy hid in the young man's tall toque hat and pulled on Linguini's
              hair to direct his motions like a puppeteer, in order to recreate
              various dishes (under Skinner's orders) and to teach him how to
              cook. Linguini was also under  the supervision
              of another formidable and bossy chef Colette Tatou (voice of Janeane
              Garofalo). Remy and Linguini  both lived in fear that their
              secret would be discovered. Linguini inherited the restaurant
              as its rightful heir, because according to the letter from his
              deceased mother, he was the (illegitimate) son of Auguste Gusteau.
              Skinner was forced out, but went on to create a line of frozen
              food products. Once Linguini revealed that the real cooking talent
              came from Remy, his staff walked out, and Remy's rat family colony
              and Colette were forced to rally together to keep the restaurant
              open, and to serve critic Anton Ego who announced that he would
              be attending. When Anton was served a traditional &quot;peasant
              dish&quot; of ratatouille, it reminded him of eating his mother's
              cooking as a boy. He met chef Remy (after all the other customers
              left) to compliment him and to call him &quot;nothing less than
              the finest chef in France,&quot; but did not reveal the secret
              chef in his glowing review. Although Gusteau's restaurant was shut
              down due to the presence of rats (after Skinner and a health inspector
              ratted on them), the discredited Ego (as a &quot;small business
              investor&quot;) subsidized a new restaurant and became one of its regular customers
              - the final shot in the film was of Linguini's and Remy's new bistro
              named &quot;Ratatouille&quot; in the city of Paris.</font></p>        </td>

                  (2007)</a>,</strong> 92 minutes, D: Chris Miller<br />
        This childrens'/family-friendly fantasy-adventure comedy was the 3rd
         computer-animated feature film in the popular  <a href="series-shrek.html"><em>Shrek</em></a> franchise-series.
        It was preceded by <a href="series-shrek.html"><i>Shrek (2001)</i></a> and <a href="series-shrek2.html"><i>Shrek
        2 (2004)</i></a>, and  followed
        by <i><a href="series-shrek4.html">Shrek Forever After (2010)</a></i>.
        In the film's opening in the fantasy Far Far Away kingdom, the happily-married,
        newly-wed couple: awkward but lovable green ogre Shrek (voice of Mike
        Myers) and Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) were about to succeed
        to the throne in the event of the death of King Harold (voice John Cleese).
        Before the ailing King died, he explained to them that his under-achieving,
        rebellious 16 year-old nephew Arthur &quot;Artie&quot; Pendragon
        (voice of Justin Timberlake), Fiona's cousin, was the true and rightful
        heir if he could be located. Competing to be King and plotting to overthrow
        Shrek was handsome Prince Charming (voice of Rupert Everett) who wished
        to avenge the death of his mother - the Fairy Godmother, and attain his
        own &quot;happily ever after.&quot;  Shrek and his sidekicks - Donkey
        (voice of Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), set off
        to find
        &quot;Artie,&quot; just after  Fiona announced that she was pregnant.
        During the trek, Shrek suffered nightmares and expressed major fears
        of fatherhood. Simultaneously, Prince Charming attempted to invade the
        kingdom, stage a coup, overthrow and take over the government, and assume
        the throne. He had allied himself with many other fairy-tale villains,
        including Captain Hook (voice of Ian McShane). Loser, skinny, dorky slacker
        &quot;Artie&quot; was found as an underachieving student at Worcestershire
        Academy, an elite boarding school, and was very apprehensive about becoming
        the new King. On an island, the group met up with Artie's retired ex-wizard
        teacher, Merlin (voice of Eric Idle) before being transported back. Meanwhile,
        Fiona and Queen Lillian (voice of Julie Andrews) escaped from Charming's
        assault, but then many of them were captured, including Fiona's fairy-tale
        friends (Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, The Big Bad Wolf, The Three Blind
        Mice and The Three Little Pigs, Dragon, and Donkey and Dragon's children),
        and four princesses: Cinderella (voice of Amy Sedaris), Sleeping Beauty
        (voice of Cheri Oteri), Rapunzel (voice of Maya Rudolph), and Snow White
        (voice of Amy Poehler). The princesses were imprisoned in Rapunzel's
        tower. After Shrek and his companions returned to Far Far Away, Charming
        was conspiring to kill Shrek, whose forces were 
        mostly overwhelmed, but with Artie's ingenuity and clever ruses, he convinced
         the villains to stop and turn over a new leaf. He revealed
        his leadership qualities and was able to foil Charming. Charming's attempt
        to kill Shrek failed, and the usurper was covered by the bricks of the
        collapsing tower brought down by Dragon's tail. Artie agreed to become
        the kingdom's new monarch (King Arthur), and Fiona delivered ogre triplets
        to be cared for back in the swamp.</font></p>        </td>

                  3 (2007)</a>, </strong>138 minutes, D: Sam Raimi<br />
        This 3rd installment of the comic-book series of <i>Marvel</i> superhero-fantasy
        films was also the last part of director Sam Raimi's trilogy in the <a href="series-spiderman.html"><em>Spider-Man</em></a> franchise-series.
        Two films followed in the next decade with a new director Marc Webb:
        <i><a href="series-spiderman4.html">The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)</a></i>, and <i><a href="series-spiderman5.html">The Amazing Spider-Man 2
        (2014)</a></i>. In this story set a number of months after the events of
        the second film, Peter's steady girlfriend remained Mary Jane Watson
        (Kirsten Dunst), now a struggling Broadway actress, although Peter's
        student lab partner, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) also vied for his
        attention. Peter
        was a Columbia University student while working as a freelance photographer
        for <i>The Daily Bugle, </i>with rival co-worker Eddie
            Brock (Topher Grace).  Peter's
        ex-best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), son of Norman Osborn (Willem
        Dafoe), sought revenge for his father's death (blamed on Spider-Man),
        by resurrecting himself as the new Goblin. Meanwhile,
        escaped prisoner Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) (whom Peter later
        learned was allegedly responsible for the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff
        Robertson)), was being sought by police. He fell into a particle accelerator
        and became a shape-shifting, humanoid sand creature later known as Sandman. In
        addition to these new foes, a mysterious, parasitic black goo (an alien
        symbiote) affixed itself to Peter's red-and-blue spider-suit - his costume
        turned  jet black, and he assumed further powers. However, his personality
         was seriously altered, turning him hostile, aggressive and dark. He
        also became flirtatious toward Gwen, making MJ jealous and on the verge
        of breaking up (and hooking up with Harry). Meanwhile, Peter's rival
        Brock took over his job and was determined
        to defame and incriminate Spider-Man. After Peter was able to remove
        the symbiote, it attached itself to Brock  who became the  new
        host, transforming him into a fanged and clawed Venom. The new villain
        teamed up with Sandman to target Spider-Man. In the film's conclusion,
         the allied Sandman and Venom battled Spidey as he attempted to save
        an abducted MJ atop a skyscraper in front of the Manhattan skyline,
        while Harry-Goblin switched allegiances to help Peter. Harry was lethally
        impaled with is own glider, while Brock and the symbiote were vaporized
        by an explosion. Peter accepted Marko-Sandman's apology for the death
        of his uncle and let him escape. The film ended with Peter's reconciliation
        with MJ. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Tim Burton<br />
              Director Tim Burton's musical, and part melodramatic thriller-slasher
              film was an adaptation of the 1979 Tony Award-winning  
          musical by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler.
          The bloody and dark story, set in the Victorian era, was considered
          a semi-slasher film due to its themes of serial murders and cannibalism.
          In the plot, ex-convict Sweeny Todd / Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp),
          who felt he had been wrongly-imprisoned in Australia for 15 years,
          returned to  Fleet Street in his hometown of London. Formerly in the
          mid-1840s, his name was Benjamin Barker, when he was happily-married
          with a daughter named Johanna (Jayne Wisener as teenager). Adopting
          the name Sweeney Todd, he was highly bitter and sought vengeance against
          his accusers, in particular corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) who
          had seduced-raped his wife Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly) during his absence,
          prompting her to attempt to commit suicide by poisoning. The Judge
          then took custody of Johanna (Jayne Wisener) and adopted  her as his
          ward. The demonic and psychopathic Todd opened up a barber shop,
          specializing in throat slashings with a straight razor blade. Due
          to his murderous rampage, he was labeled &quot;The Demon Barber
          of Fleet Street.&quot; His
          lover and sinister accomplice, widowed Mrs. Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham
          Carter), the proprietor of a meat pie shop below the barber shop, served
          meat pies (composed of fresh cadaver meat). Todd had set up his barber
          chair above a trap-door so that his victims' bodies would drop below
          and be deposited in Lovett's bakehouse. He successfully sought vengeance
          by eventually slitting the throats of both the Judge and his accomplice
          Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall). In the film's conclusion, mistaken
          identity  caused Todd to kill his own
          wife Lucy (an insane beggar woman), when he also realized that Mrs.
          Lovett had been motivated to jealously misled him (about Lucy's suicide)
          to keep him all for herself. Enraged, he hurled her into her own opened
          bakehouse oven. Todd then allowed Mrs. Lovett's  boy assistant Toby
          (Ed Sanders) to slit his throat, and he expired as he bled over Lucy's
          corpse. </font></p>        </td>

          Paul Thomas Anderson</font><br />
          <font size="2">Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's
          visually-stunning and well-acted biographical epic-drama was based
          upon Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel <i>Oil!</i> about the mad scramble
          for profits in the oil business. The main character was ambitious,
          charismatic and pioneering oilman Daniel Plainview (Oscar-winning Daniel
          Day-Lewis). In his early days during the late 1800s, he had been a
          hard-working, silver miner prospecting for the valuable ore in a pit-mine
          in New Mexico. On a ruthless and driven quest to become wealthy, he
          then discovered oil (black gold) in Southern California (Los Angeles)
          at the start of an oil boom in the early 20th century. He informally
          adopted an orphaned boy named H.W. (Dillon Freasier), and made him
          his  business partner to form a so-called
          'family-run operation.' Then, in 1911 in the area of Little Boston,
          CA, Daniel purchased  the land at the farm of
          Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a self-proclaimed teenaged preacher and healer,
          and the twin brother of Paul Sunday (also Paul Dano). Eli's goal was
          to funnel his $10,000 (the full purchase price) to build a new parish,
          known as the Church of the Third Revelation. The soft-spoken Eli constantly
          feuded with and confronted the exploitative and cold-hearted Daniel,
          resenting the fact that he owned drilling rights and had governance
          over the surrounding land bought from his manipulated neighbors for
          bargain prices. The only holdout was William Bandy (Hans Howes), who
          refused to sell. In the process of amassing wealth and growing his
          oil empire, Plainview became increasingly misanthropic, lonely, greedy,
          despondent and paranoid. His relationship with H.W. (who had been deafened
          from an explosion) became more distant, and as his emotional life deteriorated,
          Daniel established another relationship with a man claiming to be his
          half-brother, Henry Brands (Kevin J. O'Connor). However, when Daniel
          later suspected that Henry was an imposter, he forced him to confess
          that he only knew
          Daniel's brother in Kansas, and had assumed his identity after his
          death. Plainview cold-bloodedly murdered Henry, and buried him on the
          Bandy property. The next day, Bandy offered to lease his land, in exchange
          for Daniel's baptism in Eli's Church (with a confession that he was
          a sinner and had abandoned his son). After
          the marriage of H.W. to Eli's younger sister Mary (Colleen Foy as adult)
          in 1927, and the announcement of their plans to move to Mexico and
          begin his own oil business, Daniel disowned H.W. as a &quot;bastard&quot; orphan.
          In the film's climactic conclusion set in Plainview's bowling alley
          in his mansion, radio preacher Eli was reluctantly forced to confess
          that he was seriously in debt and was a &quot;false prophet and God
          is a superstition.&quot; 
		  The drunken Daniel then admitted that he had already stolen all the
		  oil  under Bandy's property, and proceeded to batter Eli to death in
		  the head with a bowling pin. Daniel's final words to his butler 
		  were: &quot;I'm finished.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              140 minutes, D: Olivier Dahan<br />
              This subtitled, biographical musical drama, an impressionistic
              and non-linear rags-to-riches film, told about the difficult, chaotic
              and tragic life of iconic French singer &Eacute;dith
              Piaf (Oscar-winning Marion Cotillard). Born in 1915 in early 20th
              century Paris, &Eacute;dith
              Gassion was a frail and sickly child (Manon Chevallier and Pauline
              Burlet). Abandoned and neglected by both parents, her alcoholic
              mother Anetta (Clotilde Courau) was a street singer in the Belleville
              district of Paris, while her father Louis Gassion (Jean-Paul Rouve)
              (who served in the Great War) was a circus acrobatics performer
              and street contortionist. She was raised by her paternal grandmother
               who was a madam in a Normandy brothel. She was discovered while
              singing for handouts on a Montmartre street corner (at age 19),
              with  her best friend M&ocirc;mone (Sylvie Testud), by nightclub-cabaret
              owner Louis Lepl&eacute;e
              (G&eacute;rard Depardieu). She acquired the nickname 'Little Sparrow&quot; (or
              La M&ocirc;me Piaf). (&Eacute;dith
               had agreed to sing for money instead of working as a prostitute
               for her pimp boyfriend Albert (Dominique Bettenfeld)). She was
               hired and managed by Lepl&eacute;e,
               but then he was shot dead, and there were scandalous allegations
               that &Eacute;dith was involved due to her connections to the mob
               through her pimp. She was given vocal lessons by strict coach
               and mentor Raymond Asso (Marc Barb&eacute;), and
               assisted by song-writer Marguerite Monnot (Marie-Armelle Deguy)
               to perfect her already-strong singing voice and stage presence. &Eacute;dith
               became a singing sensation in the 1930s in concert halls throughout
               Europe and the US. During a performance tour in NYC, she met and
               found short-lived happiness during an affair with already-married,
                world middle-weight French boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre
               Martins), who was taken from her in a plane crash on a flight
               from Paris to NY. She married singer Jacques Pills (Laurent Olmedo),
               but then a serious car crash in California in 1951 contributed
               to her lifelong addictions to pain-killing morphine and alcohol,
               and to a debilitating case of arthritis. In the poignant ending,
               her premature death at age 47 in 1963 from liver cancer was juxtaposed
               with her on-stage, signature-song performance of  &quot;Non,
               je ne regrette rien&quot; (I regret nothing).</font></p>
