          <p><font size="2"><b>The Abyss (1989), </b>140 minutes, D: James Cameron<br />
          Director James Cameron's expensive but impressive landmark science-fiction
              adventure film had a pacifist message similar to the one in <i><a href="dayearth.html">The
              Day The Earth Stood Still (1951)</a></i>. It received   four
              Academy Award nominations, and won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. In
              the startling, credit-less opening title sequence, the words &quot;THE
              ABYSS&quot; emerged from the darkness, and
                then the camera descended down into the letter &quot;Y&quot; into
                the ocean - there appeared a view of an American, ballistic missile
                nuclear submarine, the <i>U.S.S. Montana; </i>the experimental
                submarine was on patrol near the Cayman Trough, a very deep water
              area, and experienced a momentary loss of power.  In
              early 1994, when the US submarine attempted to follow a fast and
              highly maneuverable entity (or &quot;bogey&quot;)
                - possibly a provocative alien species, it unexplicably struck
                an undersea mountainous ridge and quickly sank into the abyss,
                falling into the deep Caribbean Sea waters (about 25,000 feet
                down). This was soon after followed by a frighteningly-realistic
                drowning scene, and a scene of divers surveying the drowned corpses
              - with facial expressions that mocked death. With
              a hurricane and the Soviets approaching, the US Navy attempted
              a rescue and salvage operation, by requesting and demanding help
              from the crew of an underwater oil-drilling platform known as Deepcore
              - the prototype of a roving, seabed oil-drilling station. The assignment
              was to be reluctantly led and conducted by Deepcore's rig foreman
              Virgil &quot;Bud&quot; Brigman (Ed Harris), and his assertive, estranged wife Dr. Lindsey Brigman
                (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), Deepcore's designer and project
                engineer. Both would now be forced to work closely together even
              though there were involved in a pending divorce. The
              Deepcore personnel members were also joined by US Navy SEAL commandos,
              headed by Lt. Hiram Coffey (Michael Biehn), who was leading the
              effort to untrigger the sunken submarine's cargo of 24 potent,
              Trident nuclear missile warheads: (&quot;8
                M.I.R.V.s per missile - that's a hundred and ninety-two warheads&quot;).
                It was revealed, as a foreshadowing, that he was susceptible to pressure
                sickness (known as HPNS - &quot;High Pressure Nervous
              Syndrome&quot;) that was known to drive individuals insane. The
              film featured many computer-generated images during enigmatic encounters
              with the alien craft and visits with the watery, luminous abyss-dwelling
              aliens - known as NTIs (Non-Terrestrial Intelligences), including
              the revelatory emergence of a glowing purple/pink ship in front
              of Lindsey -- and her later description of it to  &quot;Bud&quot;:
              (&quot;It... it was like a dance of light!&quot;). In  the
              amazing &quot;pseudopod&quot; sequence, a CGI water-based tentacle 
			  or tube of water morphed into the faces of Lindsey and Bud. Coffey was
              intent on destroying the NTIs, and armed a warhead retrieved from
              the submarine to eliminate the aliens; during Lt. Coffey's two
              major tense, action sequences after he became delusional and paranoid
              from the intense pressure, he knife-fought with Bud and engaged
              in a &quot;chase&quot; scene involving two mini-submersibles that
              culminated in Coffey's death when he was crushed within his submersible
              by the pressure, but Bud and Lindsey were stranded in their leaking
              mini-submersible with only one aqualung. Lindsey
              made the devastating decision to let Bud use their sub's sole diving
              suit to swim back to the platform, towing her body behind him in
              the frigid water. Subsequently, Lindsey drowned (went into deep
                hypothermia) and Bud was called upon to frantically resuscitate
                her using a combination of methods: heart-shocks, pounding on
                her chest, screaming at her, slapping her, crying, and mouth-to-mouth
            CPR, until she gasped and took a breath. The resuscitation sequence was 
			paralleled by Lindsey's speech to Bud
            when he decided to engage in a free-fall wearing an experimental
            diving suit (breathing oxygenated fluid instead of air) - a possible
            'one-way' trip to descend into the 2.5 mile deep Abyssal Trench to
            defuse a nuclear bomb warhead. Lindsey sent heartfelt and reassuring
            messages that were relayed to him as he
            descended dangerously into a deep ocean trench to disarm the nuclear
            warheads on the submarine: (&quot;I know how alone you feel... alone
            in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you.
            Oh Bud you're not alone...I'm with you. I'll always be with you,
            Bud, I promise that&quot;). After
            dismantling the warhead in a tense sequence (he had to guess the
            wire to be cut), Bud ran out of oxygen, and was encountered by beneficent,
            angelic-looking NTI's (Non-Terrestrial Intelligences) who rescued
            him; they took him to their awe-inspiring underwater city and their
            mothership - in a <a href="twot.html"><i>2001</i></a>-ish
            and/or <a href="clos.html"><i>Close Encounters</i></a>-like sequence. During
            his time with the NTIs, Bud was shown TV clips about the destructive
            nature of human beings with images of war, genocide and aggression
            - one of the originally deleted scene (restored in the director's
            cut) was the astonishing &quot;tidal
                  wave&quot; sequence in which both coasts (and an unnamed Russian
                  port and other global locations) were threatened by massive
                  amounts of water (1,000 foot high tidal wave megatsunamis controlled
                  by the NTIs - but then subsided (followed by a warning from
                  the aliens to Bud and all of humanity against war-like aggression);
                  they changed their minds due to Lindsey's compassionate message
          to Bud: &quot;LOVE YOU WIFE.&quot; The film concluded with the rise of 
		  the alien ship to the ocean's surface,
          the saving of the Deepcore crew, and a reunion between Bud and Lindsey
          after their greeting: (&quot;Hi, Brigman,&quot; &quot;Hi, Mrs. Brigman&quot;). </font></p>        </td>

        Tim Burton's noirish, live-action comic-book superhero film was a more
        dark and menacing version of the campy and humorous 1966-68 <i>Batman</i> TV
        series and feature film <i>Batman (1966)</i>. The ambitious blockbuster
        hit, the highest-grossing film of the year, featured the title character
        -  the brooding Caped Crusader/Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) - a winged
        vigilante battling crime after his parents' murder. Mobster henchman
        Jack Napier (the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents many years earlier)
        was also transformed after falling into a vat of acidic chemicals, to
        become the insane and outlandish Joker (a scene-stealing, over-the-top,
        clownish Jack Nicholson, top-billed). With a
              grotesque visage on a pure white face (with an impossibly-wide,
              hideous, perma-grin on his blood-red lips), he personified extreme
              avarice, anarchy, cruelty, and sick humor. Calling himself the
              maniacal, insane and clownish Joker and using gadgets as weapons,
              he vowed to spread a reign of terror over Gotham City against
              his masked nemesis. [Note: In tribute to Nicholson's inimitable,
              over-the-top portrayal of the Joker, Heath Ledger reprised the
          character in <i>The Dark Knight (2008)</i>.]</font></p>        </td>

            was a physically fit athlete who had pride in his country, but that
            disappeared with his debilitating injury. His disillusionment was

              D: Woody Allen<br />
            Perhaps Woody Allen's darkest, most somber movie, <em>Crimes and
            Misdemeanors (1989)</em> took a long, provocative, and ultimately
            downbeat look at morality with its ensemble cast. The tragi-comedy
            was impressive for its literate and provocative questioning about
            God's existence and life's meaning. Dual, multi-layered stories about
            Manhattanites, each composing about one-half of the film, were interwoven
            together, and interconnected by the character of a mutual friend
            - a lone holy man and rabbi named Ben (Sam Waterston) who was going
            blind. The first story dealt with Judah Rosenthal (Martin Landau),
            a wealthy, law-abiding, well-respected,
            middle-aged ophthalmologist who was married to Miriam (Claire
            Bloom) - Rosenthal was successful in nearly every way. However,
            an enraged and obsessed flight attendant and ex-lover Dolores Paley
            (Anjelica Huston), his mistress with whom he had been cheating, threatened
            to divulge the scandal and ruin his life. With this dilemma facing
            him, Judah was forced to take extreme measures - he contemplated
            the murder of his mistress by contacting his seldom-seen
            brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) with Mafia connections. His guilt over
            her murder forced him to revisit his past and ask basic questions
            about his own values, the unfairness of life, virtue, 'the eyes of
            God,' a god-less universe, justice for evil-doing, and unequal punishment
            of the wicked. Meanwhile, in the lighter-spirited other half of the
            movie, Cliff Stern (Woody Allen), a dedicated but struggling, serious
            documentary filmmaker (who was married but in the process of separating
            from his wife Wendy (Joanna Gleason), Lester's sister), was reluctantly
            forced to direct a film of his despised rival - his superficial,
            vain but extremely successful brother-in-law and TV sit-com producer
            Lester (Alan Alda). Complicating matters, Stern had to compete with
            Lester over the object of his impossibly-romantic affections - the documentary's attractive
            production associate  Halley Reed (Mia Farrow).</font></p></td>

              Spike Lee<br />
            This was the
            third (and breakout) feature film for African-American writer/director
            Spike Lee (who also starred as the pizzeria's delivery boy Mookie),
            whose resume already included: <em>She's Gotta Have It (1986)</em>,
            and <em>School Daze (1988).</em> Film critics wrongly feared that
            Lee's film was a call to revolution and would cause and incite similar
            responses from black urban-dwellers. However, it   was an even-handed,
            complex, unapologetic but still-disturbing social protest work about
            racism, racial pride, class struggle, intolerance, oppression and
            violence (based on real-life events). The controversial thought-provoking
            film provided a raw portrait of explosive conflict and relations
            between Italian- and African-Americans, Koreans and white law-enforcement
            in a multi-ethnic Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood block (in Brooklyn)
            during a stifling hot summer day. During the
            opening credits, hip-hop group Public Enemy performed the film's
            hard-edged anthem and title rap song, &quot;Fight
            the Power.&quot; The multi-ethnic cast of the film provided three-dimensional
            characters, and featured on-going commentary by local
            black DJ Mister Senor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson). Other roles
            included white Italian-American pizzeria owner Sal (Danny Aiello),
            and 25 year-old pizza delivery boy Mookie (Spike Lee) and his girlfriend
            Tina (Rosie Perez). The tensions began to escalate
            in this slice-of-life film because of a complaint by Mookie's friend
            - a militant patron named Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) (and later
            by boom-box carrying Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn)) that there were no
            pictures of 'brothers' on the &quot;Wall
            of Fame&quot; in Sal's restaurant. A boiling point was eventually
            reached in this street-wise landmark film.</font></p>          </td>

              Van Sant, Jr.<br />
              Director Gus Van Sant's penetrating, post-modern second film, a
              crime drama and road trip saga, was a risky piece of work - under-appreciated
              and overlooked, yet it became his breakthrough film. The film was
              based on the 1990 published autobiographical novel by James Fogle.
              Set in the year 1971, it followed the aimless lives of four resourceful
              dropouts cruising in the Pacific Northwest to steal prescription
              drugs (dilaudid, morphine and cocaine) from various pharmacies
              and hospitals, while living a dreary communal life. The 26 year-old
              junkie leader of the pack of dysfunctional teens was Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hughes
              (Matt Dillon), accompanied by his addicted wife Dianne Hughes (Kelly
              Lynch), Bob's best friend Rick (James LeGros) and his teen junkie
              girlfriend Nadine (Heather Graham). Bob became increasingly
              desperate when faced with the consequences of drug addiction (a
              lethal overdose by  Nadine) and pressure from police authorities.
              By the film's conclusion, Bob had entered a methadone treatment
              program to go straight, split from Dianne who had left him for
              Rick, and was shot and seriously wounded by another junkie and
              on a stretcher bound for a hospital to be kept alive -  he ironically
              noted that it had &quot;the fattest pharmacy in town.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

            Just one year after playing catcher &quot;Crash&quot; Davis in <em><a href="bulldurham.html">Bull
            Durham (1988)</a></em>, Kevin Costner appeared in this - another
            baseball-themed film - coupled with the religious themes of
            faith and redemption<em>.</em> It was adapted
            from W. P. Kinsella's novel <em>Shoeless Joe</em>.  The sports fantasy-drama
            was almost dreamlike (aided by the mystical score by James Horner).
            This sentimental, modern classic became a smash hit in its
            unique depiction of Americana. The Capra-esque
            film recalled <em>Harvey (1950)</em>, a film in which its main character
          (James Stewart) believed he was befriended by a giant 6-foot rabbit
          that no one could see. (The 1950 b/w film was seen  at one point in
          the film on TV, to emphasize the connection.) Idealistic
          36 year-old Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner), a transplanted city boy-turned-Iowa
          corn farmer, heard a ghostly Voice telling him to build a baseball
          diamond in the middle of his corn field (&quot;If you build it, he
          will come&quot;) - and then another bit of advice - to &quot;ease
            his pain.&quot;  His wife Annie (Amy
            Madigan) and their young daughter Karin (Gaby Hoffmann) were semi-supportive
            but worried about their finances if he plowed down their crops. No
            one but those who believed could see the ghostly ballplayers who
            began to appear. Ray met with various sad and wistful icons, including
            the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) who was banned from
            baseball for life after the 1919 Black Sox scandal, a disillusioned,
            reclusive J.D. Salinger-like writer in Boston named Terence Mann
            (James Earl Jones), and a small-town doctor named Doc &quot;Moonlight&quot;   Graham
            (Burt Lancaster) - a rookie player who years earlier yearned to make
            it into the major leagues. The film reached its climax with Mann's
            famous monologue on the place of baseball in American history: &quot;The
            one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America
            has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It's been erased like
            a blackboard, rebuilt, and erased again. But baseball has marked
            the time. This field, this game, is a part of our past, Ray. It reminds
            us of all that once was good, and that could be again. Oh people
        will come, Ray. People will most definitely come.&quot; By the film's
        conclusion, he was able to restablish a broken connection with his deceased
        father John Kinsella (Dwier Brown) through a game of catch on the field
        he had built. </font></p>          </td>

            Director Edward Zwick's historical wartime drama was one of the very
                best, fact-based Civil war films. The two historical novels on
                which it was based were 1973's <em>Lay This Laurel</em> by
                Lincoln Kirstein and 1965's <em>One Gallant Rush</em> by Peter
                Burchard. Another source was comprised of  the
                letters written by the commander of the 600-man regiment - the
                centerpiece of the film. It also featured
                a Grammy-winning, powerful score by James Horner accompanied
                by The Harlem Boys Choir. The well-received film had five Oscar
            nominations: Best Art/Set Decoration, and Best Film Editing,
            with three wins: Best Supporting Actor (Denzel Washington), Best
            Cinematography (Freddie Francis), and Best Sound Editing. It
            depicted the overlooked but brave and distinguished participation
            of all-volunteer, African-American soldiers on the side of the
            Union in the first all-black 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts
            Volunteer Infantry (composed of runaway slaves and northern &quot;freemen&quot;).
            The unit was led by 25-year old white commander, Col. Robert Gould
            Shaw (Matthew Broderick) who came from a privileged, abolitionistic
            family in Boston. The film focused on the hard training of the troops
            before battle to earn credibility with prejudiced military authorities,
             and their actual demonstration of courage, bravery, sacrifice and
            determination during combat. The movie climaxed with their final,
            suicidal assault in mid-July 1863 on the impregnable Fort Wagner
            near Charleston, South Carolina - it failed but ultimately turned
            the tide of the war. Strong supporting roles were from bitter,
            ex-slave recruit Pvt. Trip (Denzel
            Washington in a star-making role), born leader Sgt. Major John Rawlins
            (Morgan Freeman who transcended typical Hollywood stereotypes
            about African-Americans with his distinctive performance) and
            Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes).</font></p>          </td>

              Branagh<br />
            Director/screenwriter Kenneth Branagh's  adaptation of William
            Shakespeare's timeless, epic play <em>Henry
            V </em>- was his debut film as both screenwriter and director. From
            three Academy Award nominations (including Best Actor and Best Director),
            it won the Oscar for Best Costume Design. The
             play was chiefly about royal responsibility, war and its effects.
             The nature of the film was deeply affected by the historical context
            in which it was created -- it debuted during a post-Vietnam
            era when there was great cynicism about war. Branagh's
            revisionistic film was dramatic, grandiose, passionate and darkly
            serious. It told about the title character -  
            young, 15th century British King Henry V, including his differences
            with King Charles VI of France (Paul Scofield), his invasion of France
            in 1415 A.D., and his victory at the crucial and bloody Battle of
            Agincourt against a larger French force. Henry
            took as his bride French princess Katherine of Valois (Emma Thompson, Branagh's wife at the
            time), the daughter of Charles VI. The film's highlights were -- Henry V's pre-battle speech to his troops
            at the siege of Harfleur, from Act III, Scene 1, beginning with the
            stirring line: &quot;Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; or close the wall
            up with our English dead,&quot; and his St. Crispin's Day address
            to his battle-weary men, from Act IV,
            Scene 3, &quot;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he
          today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

          </b>This dramatic courtroom thriller was taglined: &quot;As
          a lawyer all she wanted was the truth. As a daughter all she wanted
          was his innocence. How well do you really know your father?&quot; Hungarian-American
          immigrant Michael J. Laszlo (Armin Mueller-Stahl), an anti-Communist,
          was threatened with having his US citizenship revoked, and being
          deported to Hungary to stand trial for war crimes. Laszlo insisted
          that it was a case of mistaken identity. His daughter Ann Talbot
          (Jessica Lange), a tough Chicago defense attorney, unwisely decided
          to defend her father in the case. One of her motivations was her
          son Mikey's (Luke Haas) deep love for his grandfather. Talbot's
          prepared defense was that the communist Budapest government (and
          its AVO secret police) had fabricated the allegations due to Laszlo's
          fanatical anti-Communist feelings. The US federal government's
          position, argued by prosecutor Jack Burke (Frederic Forrest), was
          that Laszlo had falsified his original citizenship application
          by failing to disclose his name &quot;Mishka&quot; - and his leadership
          and association with the terrorist organization, political party
          and death squad known as Arrow Cross that had brutally persecuted
          and murdered scores of Hungarian Jews. The presiding judge was
          Judge Irwin Silver (James Zagel), a Jew. During
          the denaturalization trial in a Chicago federal court, evidence was
          presented showing a copy of young Laszlo's Arrow Cross ID card with
          his name &quot;Laszlo
              Miklos.&quot; The picture matched his visa application. Talbot
              argued that any evidence was forged or inauthentic. However, there
              were surviving witnesses who testified to 'Mishka's' atrocities.
              During cross-examination, Ann was able to cast some doubt on some
              of the prosecution's charges. During the trial, the judge and opposing
              lawyers traveled to Budapest, where Ann planned to speak to a witness
              who couldn't travel, and was handed some documents by a member
              of the secret police. During the witness' testimony, Ann discredited
              him - she dismissed the accusations and documents by claiming that
              the witness had identified three completely different individuals
              as 'Mishka.' Judge Silver promptly dismissed the government's case.
              Before leaving Europe, Ann visited Melinda Zoldan (El&#380;bieta
              Czy&#380;ewska), the sister of Tibor Zoldan, one of Laszlo's fellow
              Hungarians (and a member of the Arrow Cross organization!) to whom
              he had written numerous checks. In Zoldan's wallet was a ticket
              to a pawn shop for a music box. When she redeemed the pawn ticket
              in Chicago, she found proof of her father's guilt. The pretty music
              box contained B/W photographs of her father involved in atrocities
              and war crimes. Ann denounced her deceitful father - threatening
              to never have Mikey or herself see him again. She sent the damning
        photographs to prosecutor Burke, who publicized them in the press. </font></p>        </td>

              was this sleeper hit - a satirical and hilarious take on the fate

              Cameron Crowe's fresh and sweet HS teen love story (his directorial
              debut film) was far and away one of the best of its type, with
              added intelligent resonance about coming-of-age, facing difficult
              challenges, and making choices. Realistic empathic performances
              abound: A  charming yet average, recently-graduated
              jock-teen Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) was determinedly interested
              in  Diane Court (Ione Skye), a brainy and beautiful biochemistry
              student. However, she was being overprotected by her single father
              James Court (John Mahoney) who was also contending with troubling
              allegations of IRS tax violations. Its most memorable and iconic
              image was of a 'boom-box' hoisted over-head by Lloyd to play Peter

              D: Steven Soderbergh<br />
              26 year-old writer/director Steven Soderbergh's independent
              film (his first feature film) - a low-budget, minimalist, character-driven
              debut film was the kinky, sharply-acted, and provocative, with
              suggestive discussions of sexual topics but without nudity or sex
              scenes.  It was written in eight days and filmed over five weeks
              on a budget of $1.2 million, and became a huge hit at the Sundance
              Film Festival. The  compelling effort also
              won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, becoming
              a  catalyst for the 'independent' (non-Hollywood) film
              movement. There was explicit dialogue in videotaped discussions
              and revelatory confessions of women in New Orleans talking about
              their complex sexual experiences. Reclusive drifter Graham Walton
              (James Spader) called the voyeuristic videotaping a &quot;personal
              project,&quot; serving as a substitute for his own emotion-less, impotent and dispassionate
              life. Infidelity was revealed between his college-buddy turned
              yuppie lawyer John Mullany (Peter Gallagher), and the sexually-adventurous
              bartender sister Cynthia Patrice Bishop (Laura San Giacomo) of
              his own sexually-repressed, frigid and neglected wife Ann Bishop
              Mullany (Andie MacDowell). In one of the film's memorable scenes,

              minutes, D: Rob Reiner<br />
            This witty and likeable, lightweight, old-fashioned romantic comedy
            was intended to answer the sexual politics question, &quot;Can two
            friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?&quot; The
            main timely premise was whether a man and woman can be friends without
            sex interfering. Director Rob Reiner directed this smart, modern-day
            'screwball comedy' (his fifth film) of the semi-autobiographical
            tale - it was compiled from the shared recollections of actual romances,
            and sometimes resembled a sitcom. The engaging, episodic film keenly
            observed romance, relationships between males and females, friendship
            and sex. The summer of 1989's 'sleeper' film
            had a number of startling resemblances to Woody Allen's witty, urban
            romance <em><a href="anni.html">Annie Hall (1977)</a></em> including:
            the black and white titles and the film's title song &quot;It Had
            to Be You&quot; (sung by Diane Keaton in Allen's film), direct camera interviews-testimonials,
            split-screen techniques, the Manhattan backdrop, evocative George
            Gershwin tunes, obsessive talk about sex and death, and Harry and
            Sally's first meeting in 1977 - the year the similar film was released.
            The film's ending paralleled Allen's <em><a href="manhattan.html">Manhattan
            (1979)</a></em>. However, the two films also differed: <em>When Harry
            Met Sally...</em> illustrated how friends can ultimately realize
            that they're better as lovers, while <em>Annie Hall </em>showed how
            lovers may end up better as friends. Its most
            unforgettable scene was Sally's noisy counterfeit orgasm in a deli,
            causing the director's mother (one of the witnessing customers) to
            order: &quot;I'll have what she's having.&quot; In
            the film itself, two long-time acquaintances, often pessimistic,
            fast-talking and controlling Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) and bubbly
            Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) grappled with their friend-relationship
            over a 12-year period (beginning in the spring of 1977 as students
            when they shared a drive to New York from Chicago, and thoroughly
            irritated each other along the way), as they grew up and matured.
            Their love was not &quot;at first sight&quot; but
            took years to develop as the reluctant two often bumped into each
            other, reconnected and formed a friendship. The leads' best friends,
            Marie (Carrie Fisher) and Jess (Bruno Kirby), helped Harry's and
            Sally's friendship to evolve, and actually fell in love and got married
            themselves. A turning point for Harry and Sally was when they slept
            together one night, but then Harry was subsequently unable to express
            commitment, leading to their breakup. In the happy ending finale,
            on New Years' Eve, the two realized that they were meant for each
            other.</font></p>          </td>
