        <p><font size="2"><b>American Sniper (2014)</b>, 134 minutes, D: Clint
          Eastwood<br />
          Director Clint Eastwood's violent war drama was essentially a biopic
          of the life of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper). During
          four tours in the Iraq War (after the tragedy of the terrorist attacks
          on 9/11), he became noted for being the most lethal marksman in the
          US military, with 255 kills. The account was based on Kyle's own 2012
          memoir &quot;American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper
          in U.S. Military History.&quot; During his many tours of duty, Kyle's personal
          demons and PTSD surfaced, and his marriage to  brunette Taya Studebaker
           (Sienna Miller) (resulting in two children) suffered from multiple
          stresses and strains. The film opened in Texas where Kyle grew up,
          trained to become an expert with a rifle, and worked as a ranch-hand
          and cowboy. The patriotric young man was inspired to enlist in the
          Navy after the August, 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings (in Tanzania and
          Kenya), and he trained to become a US Navy SEAL sniper. His  
          tours in the Iraq War involved his pursuit of Al-Qaeda's sadistic second-in-command &quot;The
          Butcher&quot; (Mido Hamada), and his dogged tracking  of a deadly Iraqi sniper known as Mustafa (Sammy Sheik).
          When he finally returned home to civilian life, he continued to be
          haunted by memories of his war years, and began to slowly heal by working
          with severely disabled and wounded veterans in the local VA hospital.
          However, he lost his life when shot at a firing range by disturbed
          vet Eddie Ray Routh (Vincent Selhorst-Jones).</font></p>      </td>

        Director Tim Burton, known for quirky and original films, helmed this
            biopic (&quot;Based on True Events&quot;) of  American portrait painter
            Margaret Keane (Amy Adams). It was narrated by newspaper reporter
            Dick Nolan (Danny Huston) who admitted: &quot;It's the strangest
            goddamn story that I ever covered.&quot; The story began in 1958
            in N. California, where Margaret Ulbrich (with her young daughter
            Jane) split from her husband and moved to North Beach - a famous
            area filled with art galleries in San Francisco. To help earn a living,
            the shy, insecure and introverted Margaret created and sold her own
            portraits of waifs with large and expressive wide-open eyes. Margaret's
            people portraits were distinctively original as it was noted - &quot;Eyes
            are windows to the soul!&quot; She
            soon met and married Walter (Christoph Waltz), who was posing as
            an artist of Parisian landscapes, but was in fact a part-time real-estate
             agent.  Before long, Walter had convinced Margaret that he could
            sell her paintings, while she was secluded back at home in her painting
            room. She then discovered that he was a major fraudster and abusive
            con-artist for a number of reasons: (1) he had no talent at all -
            Walter had originally been selling Parisian paintings as his own
            after covering up the real painter's name - S. CENIC, (2) he was
            promiscuous and had kept it a secret that he had a 10 year-old daughter
            named Lily, and (3) he was profiting by selling Margaret's increasingly-popular
            paintings, and deceitfully taking credit for her works of art. When
            she came to her senses, Margaret broke up with Walter and moved to
            Hawaii with Jane to start a new life in Honolulu, while demanding
            an official divorce. Desperate to keep their secret, the manic Walter
            blackmailed Margaret to produce more paintings and sign over her
            rights to her paintings in exchange for a divorce. Eventually she
            found the courage to legally confront Walter with a lawsuit - proving
            in a painting contest that she was the creator of the 'big-eyes'
            paintings..</font></p>        </td>

        famous for his superhero &quot;Birdman&quot; character in a trilogy of big-budget
        films in the 1990s, but  now was mostly forgotten. He became  determined
         to pursue a comeback. He was also struggling 
        with frequent derisive and taunting visitations by the  caustic voice
        of 'Birdman' during internal conversations with himself. 
        In his one last attempt to gain visibility and recognition, redeem himself,
        and rebuild his career, Riggan took it upon himself to write, direct,
        and star in a live Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story: &quot;What
          We Talk About When We Talk About Love.&quot; However, his 'Birdman'
          alter-ego disagreed, promoted Riggan's return to blockbuster cinema,
          and urged Riggan to abandon the troubled, doomed-to-fail theatrical
          play. [Note: The entire plot mimicked actor Keaton's
          identification with his earlier 'Batman' superhero character and its
          aftermath in his own career.] As Riggan's first Broadway play was about
          to open, many personal and professional issues arose: (1) Riggan's
          co-star Ralph (Jeremy Shamos) was injured on the set, (2) Ralph had
          to be replaced by self-absorbed, intense, egotistical, method actor
          Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) who was known to be difficult, volatile
          and uncontrollable, (3) Riggan was in a difficult relationship with
          his drug-addicted, recently-in-rehab daughter and personal assistant
          Sam Thomson (Emma Stone), (4) another of Riggan's co-stars - neurotic
          Broadway debutante Lesley Truman (Naomi Watts) was sleeping with Mike,
          (5) a third co-star Laura Album (Andrea Riseborough), Riggan's most
          recent and unstable lover/girlfriend, told him she was possibly pregnant,
          (6) Riggan's producer, best and loyal friend, and lawyer Jake (Zach
          Galifianakis) announced that the play's finances were over-budget,
          and that the initial previews were disastrous, and (7) <i>NY
          Times</i> theater critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) was preparing to 'kill' the
          play with a scathing review. During the opening night's final scene
          when Riggan was  to commit suicide with a prop gun on stage,
          he used a real gun and unexpectedly shot himself in the head. Afterwards,
          he awoke in a hospital after the play had been rated an astounding
          success (for its ultra-realism). Tabitha's review became the film's
          subtitle:  &quot;The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.&quot; The film ended ambiguously in Riggan's
          empty hospital room with an open window. </font></p></td>

        Director Richard Linklater's amazing, lengthy coming-of-age drama was
            shot over a 12 year period (2002-2013) (in a total of 39 days) to
            closely follow the childhood and adolescence of Mason Evans, Jr.
            (Ellar Coltrane), as he aged from 6 years old to age 18 when he left
            home to begin college. He grew up in Texas, where he lived with his
            divorced parents: Olivia (Patricia Arquette) and Mason Evans Sr.
            (Ethan Hawke), and his bratty older sister Samantha or &quot;Sam&quot; (Lorelei
            Linklater). In 2005, Olivia was remarried to her University of Houston

            divorced parents, an abusive, strict and alcoholic stepfather, squabbles
            with his sister, Mason Sr.'s interactions with his kids (bowling,
            a ballgame, camping), Mason Jr.'s growing interest in girls,

        This tear-jerking,  non-exploitative, emotionally-fraught teen-aged romantic
        drama was based upon John Green's bestselling young-adult novel of the
        same name, regarding a teen couple who both faced a serious life-threatening
        illness. The two cancer patients in Indianapolis, IN were introduced
        separately: 16 year-old, stoic, smart and book-loving Hazel Grace Lancaster
        (Shailene Woodley) was diagnosed with stage-four metastatic thyroid cancer.
        The malignancy had spread to her lungs - forcing her to wear a cannula
        (oxygen tube) and always have an oxygen tank. She
        was supported by her loving parents: Frannie (Laura Dern) and Michael
        (Sam Trammell), who encouraged her to find therapeutic support at a teen
        cancer group meeting at a church. There, she met verbose, optimistic-minded
        Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; Waters
        (Ansel Elgort), who had lost a leg to bone cancer (replaced by a prosthetic
        limb), but was currently in remission. The two shared their favorite
        book choices and quickly fell in love, even though they faced uncertain
        futures. Gus overwhelmed Hazel when he offered her tickets (funded by
        the Make-A-Wish Foundation) to take a romantic, life-affirming &quot;cancer
        journey&quot; to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author Peter Van Houten (Willem
        Dafoe). He had written the book &quot;An Imperial Affliction&quot; about a girl
        named Anna (later revealed to be his own 8 year-old daughter) who died
        of leukemia. Once in Amsterdam, they discovered that Van Houten was an
        obnoxious, bitter, vindictive, and mean scotch-drinking alcoholic. Also
        during their fateful visit, Gus revealed that his cancer had returned
        and was now terminal. Back at home, soon after Gus prepared for his funeral,
        he succumbed to his disease. The film concluded with Hazel reading Gus'
        written eulogy for her - providing her with courage and strength
         to accept her own imminent death.</font></p>         </td>

          Miller</font><br />
          <font size="2">Inspired by real-life events, this sports-related crime
          docu-drama told about tragic and dysfunctional  relations regarding
          brothers who were wrestlers-in-training with a rich benefactor. The
          film was mostly set in Newtown Square (Delaware County), PA at a new
          state-of-the-art, 14,000 sq. foot athletic training facility (Foxcatcher
          National Training Center). It was located at the 800 acre &quot;Foxcatcher
          Farm&quot; estate of 50 year-old, beak-nosed, eccentric, egotistical, peculiar
          and arrogant millionaire heir John E. DuPont (Steve Carell). In 1986,
          wrestling enthusiast and philanthropist DuPont recruited Olympic
          Gold Medal-winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), the impressionable
          younger brother of similarly-lauded wrestler  Dave
          Schultz (Mark Ruffalo). Both brothers had been
          medal-recipients at the Soviet-bloc boycotted 1984 Olympics in Los
          Angeles, after which Dave was mentoring his brother as a full-time
          sparring and training partner. The plan was for Mark to prepare for
          the 1988 Seoul Olympics as part of Team Foxcatcher. After a period
          of training at Foxcatcher, Mark won a Gold Medal at the 1987 World
          Wrestling Championships. Dave finally moved to PA and joined his brother
          at the facility, where he became increasingly disturbed by Mark's cocaine
          use and deteriorating physical condition, and DuPont's menacing, domineering
          attitude and unhinged instability. DuPont's psychosexual motivation
          all along was possibly homoerotic, plus he sought respect for his coaching
          of world-class team members - especially from his disapproving and
          distant mother Jean DuPont (Vanessa Redgrave). After the death of the
          mother, and growing hostility between Dave and DuPont, an inevitable
          dark and tragic ending was bound to occur - he approached Dave and
          shot him to death in his driveway in early 1996. It was a cold-blooded,
          point-blank murder not entirely unpredictable. </font></p>        </td>

        Gillian Flynn's screenplay for this dark, plot-twisting psychological
            thriller was based on her own best-selling 2012 novel of the same
            title, about infidelity, deceit, murder, and betrayal. The catalyst
            for the grim plot (told partially in flashback via  
            diary entries) was the sudden
            disappearance of the &quot;Gone Girl&quot; of the title - on the occasion
            of a 5th wedding anniversary, pointing to the husband as the prime
            suspect during a frenzied media circus. In his childhood small-town
            of North Carthage, MO, former NYC journalist/magazine writer Nick
            Dunne (Ben Affleck) - now a co-owner of a bar and writing teacher,
            lived with his intelligent wife Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike), the inspiration
            for a popular series of &quot;Amazing Amy&quot; children's books written by
            her mother Marybeth Elliott (Lisa Banes). Nick
            reported that Amy had suddenly and unusually gone missing after a
            suspected home invasion. He was immediately questioned as a possible
            murder suspect by suspicious Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens)
            and Officer Jim Gilpinand (Patrick Fugit), who regarded him as cold,
            impassive, apathetic and unconcerned. The only individuals who supported
            Nick's version of events was his twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon)
            and his defense lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), while others thought
            he was a sociopath. The couple's supposedly perfect marital union
            was actually very troubled, marred in part by Nick's sexual cheating
            with pretty Andie Fitzgerald (Emily Ratajkowski), one of his students.
            The two often fought with each other, faced financial difficulties,
            and were forced to live off Amy's trust fund. The
          film's plot twist soon revealed that the highly-manipulative, mentally-unstable
            Amy, who enjoyed 'treasure'-scavenger hunts with cryptic clues, hadn't
            been abducted at all, but was alive and in hiding at an Ozarks campground.
            She had faked her own murder, set up and framed Nick as the guilty
            killer, and falsified a urine sample to make it appear that she was
            pregnant. She even considered committing suicide after Nick's expected
            conviction. A rapid change of heart  and major reversal about Nick
            occurred after she learned that he had been arrested for murder,
            and had expressed true remorse for his affair with Andie. With faked
            surveillance camera footage at the lake house of her wealthy
            ex-boyfriend Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris), Amy set  Desi   up
            as her kidnapper and brutal rapist before murdering him with a box-cutter
            during sex. She then returned home (covered in Desi's blood), and
            told authorities how she had escaped her kidnapper, and had come
            back to vindicate Nick of any wrongdoing. Without evidence of her
            guilt or responsibility for Desi's death, seven weeks later, she
            extorted Nick into reuniting with her in their marriage by revealing
            that she had inseminated herself with Nick's sperm stored at a fertility
            clinic.</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014, US/Germ./UK)</b>,
          100 minutes, D: Wes Anderson<br />
        The title of writer/director Wes Anderson's whimsical and quirky farce
        about friendship, theft and murder - a Euro-chic period film with an
        ensemble cast - referenced the name of a legendary and famous mountainside,
        between-the-wars 1930s resort hotel located in the Alps in the fictional
        country of the Republic of Zubrowka. The film was told with four timelines
        (the present, the 1980s, the 1960s, and the 1930s), and cleverly used
        color as a story-telling device. In the year 1968, the aging owner of
        the now aging hotel was immigrant Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham),
        who recalled to an Author-writer (Jude Law as character in 1968, and
        Tom Wilkinson as older adult) how he had served as a novice bellhop/lobby
        boy in the hotel during its golden glory days and was mentored by notorious
        but devoted and accommodating concierge Monsieur
        Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave  had a reputation as a ladies'
        man, providing sexual services to older ladies in addition to his regular
        duties. The flashbacked story set in 1932 (during a time of fascism in
        Europe) involved a valuable, priceless Renaissance painting known as
        &quot;Boy with Apple.&quot; A wealthy blonde hotel guest, 84 year-old dowager Madame
        C&eacute;line
        Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis (Tilda Swinton) (aka Madame D.) (the secret
        owner of the hotel) had bequeathed the painting to Gustave in her amended
        will, around the time of her mysterious murder in her own estate's bathroom.
        Her death was blamed on Gustave, due mostly to Madame D's opportunistic
        and greedy son Dmitri (Adrian Brody) who contested his mother's will
        and sought to recover the painting (and his mother's fortune) for himself,
         using his henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe). Those who sought
        to clear Gustave's guilt after he was falsely accused of the crime, arrested,
        and imprisoned included Gustave's mentored and trusted friend Zero (Tony
        Revolori as young boy) and Zero's lover-girlfriend Agatha (Saoirse Ronan)
        who worked as an apprentice at Mendl's, Gustave's favorite pastry shop.
        They arranged to steal the painting, break Gustave out of prison, and
        to prove that Dmitri was the real killer. The Madame's second amended
        codicil was located in an envelope stuffed into the back of the painting.
        It specifically stipulated that Gustave was the sole beneficiary of her
        entire fortune, including the hotel itself. After Gustave was shot dead
        by military soldiers, Zero (as Gustave's sole heir) succeeded him as
        the owner of the hotel.</font></p>        </td>

          in Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's novel
          <i>The Hobbit. </i>The entire Hobbit trilogy served as   a prequel
          to Jackson's <i><a href="series-lordoftherings.html">The Lord of the
          Rings</a></i> film trilogy. Jackson's action-oriented epic fantasy,
          with classic battle sequences, concluded the  tale of Bilbo
          Baggins (Martin Freeman). In the film's pre-titles opening sequence,
          the destructive and vengeful fire-spewing dragon Smaug (voice of Benedict
          Cumberbatch) set peaceful Laketown on fire. Fortunately, Bard the Bowman
          (Luke Evans) confronted Smaug and killed the creature with a black
          arrow to save young son Bain (John Bell) and become the town's new
          leader. He led the townsfolk to find refuge in the ruins of the town
          of Dale near Lonely Mountain. Elf King Lord Thranduil  (Lee Pace) arrived
          with his Elven gold-armored army forces, to bring aid and supplies
          to the displaced Lake-towners. Bilbo, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage)
          and other dwarves had watched the far-away flames of Laketown from
          Lonely Mountain in Erebor. Overcome by greed, dwarf prince Thorin -
          the future Mountain King and heir to Erebor's throne, became increasingly
          obsessed (with &quot;dragon-fever&quot;) to find and acquire all for himself
          the treasured Arkenstone inside the Mountain. [Note: All along, Bilbo
          had the precious stone hidden in his possession.] Meanwhile,
          Elrond, Lord of Rivendell (Hugo Weaving) arrived at the castle fortress
          of Dol Guldur to free Gandalf (Ian McKellen) (aka Mithrandir) from
          imprisonment by the Dark Lord (Witch King) - Necromancer / Sauron (voice
          of Benedict Cumberbatch). He received unexpected help from others,
          including grey wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) who chanted a telepathic
          incantation or spell to help aid in the release and rescue of Gandalf.
          Additional allies in the rescue included Elf-Queen Galadriel (Cate
          Blanchett) and Lord Saruman (Christopher Lee). Once Gandalf was brought
          to safety, he declared that he was off to Erebor to warn the Dwarves
          of a vision he had of the future - a major battle against the Orcs.  At
          the same time, Leader Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett) with his vast
          army of Orcs (and support from his son Bolg (John
          Tui)) were marching toward the Lonely Mountain
          at Erebor and threatened war to acquire the treasured riches originally
          held by Smaug. The large build-up in the film at the base of the Lonely
          Mountain set the stage for a climactic battle as the five armies of
          Dwarves, Elves, two contingents of Orcs, and Laketown's Men converged
          there, to fight for the future of Middle Earth.</font></p>        </td>

          (Philip Seymour Hoffman), urged a reluctant Katniss to become a &quot;Mockingjay&quot; symbol
          as part of a &quot;hearts and minds&quot; strategy against the Capitol.
          With her trusted friends, tributes Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and Finnick
          Odair (Sam Claflin), and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss vowed
          to save the nation from the Capitol. The Capitol's bombing of a refugee
          hospital in District 8 led to counter-retaliation - a suicidal human
          wave by District 5 protestors to destroy the Capitol's hydroelectric
          dam (its source of electricity), in addition to efforts by President
          Coin's elite special-forces team to rescue Peeta and other prisoners.
          Once he had been saved (almost too easily), Peeta attempted to strangle
          Katniss - a sign that he had been brainwashed ('hijacked') to kill
          her. The film concluded with preparations for an assault on the Capitol's
          principal military stronghold in District 2 - the only district remaining
          loyal to the Capitol.</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Imitation Game (2014, UK/US)</b>, 114 minutes,
          D: Morten Tyldum<br />
        The film's title &quot;the imitation game&quot; referred to Alan Turing's name
        in 1950 for his own Turing Test - a test to see if a machine could think
        and exhibit intelligent, human-like behavior. In this biographical-historical
        war drama (often condensed and not entirely representative of  the
        real historical facts), the main character was British crypt-analyst,
        computer scientist and mathematician Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch),
        who was the main force in decrypting Nazi-German intelligence messages
        (using an Enigma code) for the Allied British government during WWII.
        His efforts undoubtedly shortened the war by two to four years. The film
        juggled three different time frames: Turing's early teenaged years in
        the late 1920s when he was bullied, the latest time period in 1951, and
        the most prominent time period in the middle - from 1939 through the
        war years. Part of the film touched on Turing's closeted homosexuality
        and how it profoundly affected his life. Cambridge-educated cryptologist
        Turing was recruited by the British government to break the Nazi's code
        for the Enigma - a machine that they used to send encrypted &quot;unbreakable&quot;
        instructions to their Axis-Powers military personnel. He was assisted
        by pioneering female Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), another Cambridge
        graduate, to work at Bletchley Park (an English country house-estate)
        with other code-breakers. They were able to devise and develop Colossus
        (unnamed in the film) - an automatic machine to help with the decryption.</font></p>        </td>

          Anderson<br />
        This sex and drug filled post-noir crime drama was based upon Thomas
        Pynchon's 2009 novel of the same name. It was set in the underworld crime
        scene of Los Angeles in 1970. The main character, PI/detective Larry
        &quot;Doc&quot; Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), a pot-smoking stoner-hippie, became
        embroiled in complex plot during his investigation of various strands
        of  kidnapping cases. In the film's opening in a beach house, &quot;Doc&quot; was
        visited by his sexy ex-girlfriend Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston),
        who reported that powerful real-estate developer Michael Z. &quot;Mickey&quot; Wolfmann  (Eric
        Roberts), her new wealthy boyfriend and sugar daddy - was about to be
        kidnapped by his wife and her boyfriend/lover and committed to an insane
        asylum (in order to acquire his insurance money). &quot;Doc&quot; was also commissioned
        to find Glenn Charlock (Christopher Allen Nelson), a white supremacist
        and Aryan Brotherhood member and one of Wolfmann's bodyguards. When found
        unconscious next to Charlock's dead body in a brothel, &quot;Doc&quot; was questioned
        by combative, brutish LAPD Lt. Detective Christian F. &quot;Bigfoot&quot; Bjornsen
        (Josh Brolin), about Charlock's murder and the disappearance of Shasta
        and Mickey. He was aided in his release from the LAPD and helped in subsequent
        searches by attorney Sauncho Smilax, Esq. (Benicio Del Toro) and Deputy
        DA Penny Kimball (Reese Witherspoon). In a related third case,  &quot;Doc&quot; also
        went searching for possibly-deceased, surf-music saxophone player Coy
        Harlingen (Owen Wilson) - the missing husband of ex-heroin addict Hope
        Harlingen (Jena Malone), who was later revealed to be an underground
        police informant in hiding. &quot;Doc&quot; also crossed paths with erotic massage
        parlor employee Jade (Hong Chau), hedonistically-perverted, drug-snorting
        dentist Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd (Martin Short) (who was  found dead from
        fang bites in his neck), and loan-shark Adrian Prussia (Peter McRobbie),
        a baseball-bat killer. The many disappearances and deaths
        all led to clues suggesting that an international, underworld drug smuggling
          syndicate known as &quot;The Golden Fang&quot;  (also the name of the boat used
               to smuggle heroin into the country) was involved in a conspiracy
        with the LAPD, that was  directly tied to the murder Doc was trying to
        solve.</font></p>        </td>

          Nolan<br />
        Director Christopher Nolan's lengthy, gripping, and dazzling sci-fi family
        drama was set in a future dystopic time period in the year 2067, when
        massive crop failures and incessant dust storms on the scorched Earth
        threatened humanity's existence with worldwide famines. Widowed engineer
        and former NASA pilot Joseph (&quot;Cooper&quot; or &quot;Coop&quot;) Cooper (Matthew McConaughey),
        now a farmer/homesteader, was signaled by a supernatural 'ghost' in the
        bedroom of his young 10 year-old daughter Murphy or &quot;Murph&quot; (Mackenzie
        Foy as young girl). Communications were in the form of dust patterns
        on her bedroom floor that signified binary code coordinates. &quot;Coop&quot; was
        summoned to the indicated location - a secret NASA facility-laboratory
        headed by NASA scientist - Professor John Brand (Michael Caine), Cooper's
        former supervisor/mentor. He was informed that a group of 12 scientists
        were sent 10 years earlier through a wormhole (that mysteriously appeared
        48 years earlier near the rings of Saturn) into another distant galaxy
        -- and that a new mission had to be launched to find out whether three
        of the astronauts had discovered  potentially-habitable planet-worlds.
        &quot;Coop&quot; agreed to the lengthy mission on the <i>Endurance</i>        that
        meant separation from his family for years. He set off with fellow crew
        members-astronauts including Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Dr. Doyle
        (Wes Bentley), Dr. Romilly (David Gyasi), and the wise-cracking militarized
        robot TARS (voice of Bill Irwin). As time passed during his absence,
        Murph (Jessica Chastain as adult) became a brilliant Planet-A NASA scientist
        who  communicated with her lost-in-space father. After various catastrophes,
        deaths and challenges during his space adventure, &quot;Coop&quot; realized that
        he was the &quot;ghost&quot; in Murphy's room - due to their differing time periods.
        And through his wristwatch gift given to young Murphy before he left,
        &quot;Coop&quot; was able to send her a Morse Code message - enabling her to ensure
        the survival of humanity through a mass exodus. 
        In the film's conclusion, &quot;Coop&quot; reunited with his now-elderly daughter
        (Ellen Burstyn) on an orbiting space colony-settlement circling Saturn. </font> </p>        </td>

          Director Rob Marshall (with Walt Disney Studios) created this musical
          fantasy - a tale of adventure adapted from Stephen Sondheim's 1986
              Broadway musical, and inspired by a mash-up of four Brothers Grimm
              fairy tales (&quot;Cinderella,&quot;  &quot;Little
              Red Riding Hood,&quot;   &quot;Jack and the
        Beanstalk,&quot; and &quot;Rapunzel&quot;). The film's plot was about a childless
        couple, a Baker (James Corden) and his Wife (Emily Blunt), whose family
        tree was cursed by a vengeful and evil Witch (Meryl Streep). To remove,
        break or reverse the spell (and help the Witch create a potion to reverse
        her ugliness), they had to engage in a scavenger hunt to procure four
        magical items in three nights: a blood-red cape (Little Red Riding Hood
        (Lilla Crawford)), a strand of corn-yellow hair (Rapunzel (MacKenzie
        Mauzy)), a pure-gold slipper (Cinderella (Anna Kendrick)), and a milk-white
        cow (Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and the Beanstalk). During their journey
        to gather the items, the couple came across the four fanciful characters
        from other fairy tales to help fulfill their requests. There were multiple
        'happy endings': Cinderella's marriage to the Prince (Chris Pine), Jack's
        killing of the Giant on the beanstalk and newfound wealth with his mother
        after selling a golden egg, the rescue of Little Red Riding Hood (and
        her Grandmother (Annette Crosbie)) from the Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp),
        the Witch's youthful transformation  after feeding three of the 
        items to Jack's Milky-White cow to produce the potion, and the pregnancy
        of the Baker's Wife. However, everything wasn't resolved in the film's
        dour second ending: the Prince cheated on Cinderella with the Baker's
        Wife, the Witch lost her magical powers but ran off with Rapunzel's Prince
        (Billy Magnussen) - the brother of the Prince, and the angry Giant's
        widowed wife (Frances de la Tour) stomped around causing earthquakes
        and destruction. After many tragedies, including the deaths of some of
        the major characters (i.e., the Baker's Wife, Red's mother and grandmother,
         and Jack's mother), the remaining group members worked together to eliminate
        the Giant's wife, and then resolved to help raise the Baker's newborn
        baby boy as a surrogate family. The Witch delivered a  cautionary moral
        of the tale about carefully raising children: &quot;Careful the tale you
        tale, that is the spell, children will listen.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          In this R-rated legal-courtroom and family drama/thriller, successful,
              cynical, unethical and slick Chicago urban defense lawyer Henry
              &quot;Hank&quot; Palmer (Robert Downey, Jr.) made plans to return to his
              rural home of Carlinville, IN, when news of his mother's death
              arrived. He was in the midst of a divorce from his unfaithful wife
              Lisa (Sarah Lancaster). His family back in rural Indiana included:
              his  older brother Glenn (Vincent D'Onofrio) - a tire shop owner
              who still lived at home (after a car accident caused by drunk 17
              year-old Hank), his developmentally-disabled, autistic younger
              brother Dale (Jeremy Strong) with a penchant for Super 8 video-recording
              everything, and his estranged, arrogant, patriarchal father Joseph
              (Robert Duvall) - the town's venerable, crusty old Judge and a
              recovering alcoholic with memory issues. In a diner, Hank also
              met his ex-girlfriend Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Powell (Vera Farmiga)
              - with whom he may have conceived an illegitimate, college-aged
              daughter Carla Powell (Leighton Meester). At
               the same time, recently-paroled ex-criminal Mark Blackwell (Mark
               Kiely) that Joseph had sent to jail for 20 years was found dead
               by the side of the road after a hit-and-run crash. Joseph became
               a prime murder suspect, charged with second-degree murder. The
               local Attorney C.P. Kennedy (Dax Shepard) chosen by Joseph to
               defend him was inadequate for the job, when compared to the prosecutor
               Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton). Hank was compelled to remain
               in town and become his father's lead attorney. During the trial,
               the Judge admitted he had a lapse in his memory (due
               to chemotherapy treatments for his terminal cancer) and could
               have killed Blackwell (there was forensic blood evidence on his
               car). He was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to four years
               in Indiana State Prison. A few months into his term, the Judge
               was compassionately released to allow him to die at home, where
               Hank was able to reconcile with his antagonistic father before
               he passed away.</font></p>        </td>

            Lord, Christopher Miller<br />
        This family-oriented, computer-animated comedy was based upon the LEGO
        brand of brick construction pieces or toys used for building structures.
        In the film's preface set in LEGO universe, a blind yet noble old wizard
         named Lord Vitruvius (voice of Morgan Freeman), one of the Master Builders,
        failed to protect a super-deadly weapon known as the &quot;Kragle&quot; from
           evil Lord Business (voice of Will Ferrell) - an evil, tyrannical
           businessman in Bricksburg. (&quot;Business&quot; was also known as &quot;President
        Business&quot; of the Octan Corporation.) After the failure, Vitruvius
        predicted that a yellow-faced individual known as &quot;the Special&quot; would
        stop the &quot;Kragle&quot; with a &quot;Piece of Resistance&quot; and save them
        all. Eight and a half years later, ordinary, lowly, anthropomorphic LEGO
        mini-figure Emmet Brickowski (voice of Chris Pratt), a cheerful, nice-guy
        construction worker was introduced living in Bricksburg. At his work
        site, he discovered the &quot;Piece of Resistance&quot; that President Business planned to use
        to destroy the LEGO universe. Emmet also met a tomboyish Wyldstyle (voice
        of Elizabeth Banks), who along with her boyfriend Batman (voice of Will
        Arnett), helped Emmet to escape from Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson) (with
        a two-sided head), Business' lieutenant. Emmet joined a resistance movement
        after realizing that he was &quot;the Special&quot; who would was called
        upon to combat Business's plan to freeze or glue everything together
        in the LEGO world with the &quot;Kragle&quot; - a tube of Krazy Glue with the label partially rubbed
        out. The glue in the tube was held back by the cap (the &quot;Piece of
        Resistance&quot;). Would Emmet fulfill the role of the &quot;Special&quot;, conquer his
        nemesis, and be able to save his LEGO friends? [Note: The film's
        plot twist was that in the live-action 'real world,' a young imaginative
        boy named Finn (Jadon Sand) was playing with his LEGO toys in his basement
        (the fanciful story being enacted), and his threatening father was known
        as &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot; (also voice of Will Ferrell) - the embodiment
        of &quot;Business.&quot;] </font></p>        </td>

            J.C. Chandor</font><br />
          <font size="2">Writer/director J.C. Chandor's   crime and marital drama-thriller
              was set in the year 1981 in the violent urban environment of New
              York City. The central character was Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac),
              a successful, hard-working immigrant (Hispanic-American) owner
          of a small but growing heating-oil distribution company-business. He
          was married to WASP Anna (Robbins) Morales (Jessica Chastain), the
          daughter of a corrupt Mafia gangster. Morales had purchased the business
          from his father-in-law, to continue the supply and delivery of Standard
          heating-oil to consumers.  Morales vowed to remain righteous, honest,
          above-board and law-abiding, but found himself being tempted into illegal
          activities, double-dealing, and foul play in the face of intense competition.
          During a period of harsh winter conditions and rampant crime, he had
          to contend with corrupt rivals who were randomly hijacking his
          trucks enroute, stealing oil, and  violently attacking his drivers,
          to deliberately intimidate him and run him out of business. Some of
          the truckers were privately forced to arm themselves with handguns
          to protect themselves, without Morales' knowledge or permission. Meanwhile,
          his wife urged him to not be weak but to violently fight back against
          his enemies. Morales also faced ongoing investigations conducted by
          Assistant DA Mr. Lawrence (David Oyelowo) to uncover price fixing and
          tax evasion and other illegalities in the heating oil distribution
          industry - including the past when his father-in-law ran the business.
          Morales was in the midst of purchasing a $2.5 million, prime East River
          dockside harbor property (a terminal) for access to imported, overseas
          petroleum, but the likelihood of the deal being finalized was quickly
          falling apart. After making a huge 40% downpayment on the property,
          if he was unable to pay the remainder within 30 days, he would lose
          his deposit and the terminal deal. However, after consoliding all of
          his funds (including hidden funds from his wife who had been &quot;skimming&quot;
          company money) to complete the deal, Morales was confronted by one
          of his disgruntled, armed truckers named Julian (Elyes Gabel), who
          had been severely beaten earlier. To his surprise, Julian committed
          suicide in front of him. In the film's final moments, it appeared that
          Morales was able to strike a political and business deal with the now-cooperative
          Assistant DA. </font></p></td>

            him to  continue to confront various
            voting-rights and social problems in the South, and to promote legislation
            to protect African-American voting rights. Johnson had already passed
             the 1964 Civil Rights Act and was reluctant to push further. King
            joined several other leaders and campaigns, including John Lewis'
            Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), to plan a peaceful
            march in Alabama, to specifically confront Alabama Governor George
            Wallace (Tim Roth) with their demands on the steps of the State Capitol.
            During the first televised march, violence broke out against the
            peaceful activist protesters, including beatings by the local gas-masked
            Alabama State Troopers as the group crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
            The march culminated in President Johnson's signing of the Voting
            Rights Act of 1965. A sub-plot of the film involved the FBI's (and
            director J. Edgar Hoover's) attempts to monitor King and investigate
            his alleged infidelities to his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo). </font></p>

          <font size="2">This compelling, coming-of-age buddy comedy-drama was
          about the friendly relationship that developed between two unlikely
          individuals in Sheepshead Bay (an area of Brooklyn, NY): retired, grouchy,
          foul-mouthed, hard-drinking, cynical, gambling-inclined Vincent MacKenna
          (Bill Murray) and precocious 12 year-old Oliver Bronstein (Jaeden Lieberher)
          - the adopted son of his new neighbor Maggie Bronstein (Melissa McCarthy),
          a single-mom divorcee and radiology CAT-scan tech operator in the midst
          of a bitter custody battle. The irascible, misanthropic, mostly-broke
          and hedonistic Vincent was a Vietnam War vet, had a fluffy Persian
          cat named Felix, and was tasked with caring for his Alzheimer's-afflicted
          wife Sandy (Donna Mitchell), while also spending time with his love
          interest - pregnant Russian stripper/prostitute Daka Parimova (Naomi
          Watts). Oliver was attending a Catholic private school where he was
          regularly bullied. While often asked to 'babysit' for Oliver (for $12/hour)
          due to Maggie's late work hours, the mentoring Vincent (a questionable
          'father figure') would take him to unexpected places, such as bars,
          strip clubs, and the racetrack, with lessons on horse-betting and how
          to punch a bully, among other things. Because of his debt to a loan-shark
          named Zucko (Terrence Howard), Vincent suffered a stroke and required
          hospitalization and therapy. And then, Maggie demanded that Vincent
          could no longer see her son - due to his unhealthy influence on Oliver.
          In the film's conclusion, Oliver chose Vincent for his &quot;Saints
          Among Us&quot; school project and publically nominated and declared him to be a Saint.</font></p></td>

            Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland<br />
           Lisa Genova's bestselling 2007 novel of the same name was the basis
           for this intimate character study and tearjerking family drama regarding
           50 year-old Columbia University linguistics professor Dr. Alice Howland
           (Julianne Moore), who was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
           Before the diagnosis, Alice lost her thoughts and words during a lecture,
           and became disoriented while jogging. The news
           was devastating to her loving, fellow professor husband John Howland
           (Alec Baldwin) and their three grown children: youngest daughter Lydia
           (Kristen Stewart) - an aspiring actress on the West Coast, Tom (Hunter
           Parrish), and eldest daughter Anna Howland-Jones (Kate Bosworth).
           Some of her children opted to take genetic testing to determine their
           own vulnerabilities. The film followed the up-and-down progression
           of Alice's disease, with some periods of clarity and others of regression. Distressingly
           - as she gradually became more and more vulnerable and her memory
           emptied and deteriorated, her vibrant personality and self-confidence
           disappeared. She lost her teaching job, and to help cope, she used
           various strategies to try to deal with her diminished capacities.
           One tactic - to record a video urging herself to suicidally overdose
           on sleeping pills, failed when she forgot midstream what she was doing.
           Her illness brought her closer to her daughter Lydia, who moved back
           to care for her mother during her declining days. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Theory of Everything (2014, UK)</b>, 123 minutes, D:  James Marsh<br />
        Director James Marsh's biographical romantic drama presented a detailed
            look at the life of acclaimed   theoretical astro-physicist
        Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). The basis for the film came from Hawking's
            own ex-wife Jane (Wilde) Hawking (Felicity Jones) and her adapted
            memoir &quot;Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen&quot; (2007).
            The story of Hawking's life began with his days in the early 1960s
            at the University of Cambridge as a gifted cosmology student with
            an interest in discovering &quot;the theory of everything&quot;,
            and his romantic life with fellow medieval Spanish literature student
            Jane - his future wife. During the process of writing his thesis
            on 'black holes,' he realized that he was losing muscle control.
            Early symptoms of twitches and degenerative muscle weakness led to
            a diagnosis of at the age of 21 of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
            (ALS) (or Motor Neurone Disease (MND)), aka Lou Gehrig's disease.
            Even as Stephen's condition slowly worsened, Jane vowed her love
            for him, married him, and they had a son named Robert, a daughter
            named Lucy, and a third son named Timothy. As the incurable disease
            worsened, Stephen was forced to use a wheelchair, and lost his ability
            to speak after a tracheotomy, but then was able to communicate with
            a computerized, robotic voice synthesizer. On his new machine, he
            put together his best-selling book, <i>A Brief History of Time</i>.
            Eventually Stephen's marriage to Jane failed, and she remarried Jonathan
            Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox), while he remarried his nurse Elaine
            Mason (Maxine Peake). The film's high-point was Hawking's inspiring
            speech with these words: &quot;However bad life
            may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While
            there's life, there is hope.&quot; </font></p></td>

          Fr./Belg./It.)</b>,
          95 minutes, D: Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne<br />
        This French psychological urban social-awareness drama was set near Liege,
        Belgium, where at the small Sowal solar panel manufacturing plant, factory
        worker Sandra Bya (Oscar-winning Marion Cotillard), a young Belgian mother
        with two children, had been off work during medical-leave treatment for
        depression. In the factory, the plant's manager boss M. Dumont (Baptiste
        Sornin) followed through on a suggestion offered by Sandra's immediate
        shop-foreman supervisor Jean-Marc (Olivier Gourmet). The idea was to
        cut Sandra's job, and pay her sixteen workmates a 1,000 Euro bonus for
        their overtime work to fill in. Sandra learned that 14 of her 16 colleagues
        had opted for the bonus during a Friday evening's vote. Through an appeal,
        Sandra was given until Monday morning (the deadline for a second secret
        ballot vote) to appeal to her co-workers to give up their monetary bonuses.
        During the weekend, Sandra appealed to as many colleagues as she could
        (with mixed results and reactions), but then was devastated to learn
        that her bullying foreman Jean-Marc was politicking against her return
        to work. She took an overdose of Xanax, but was saved by her supportive
        husband Manu (Fabrizio Rongione). On Monday when the second vote was
        taken, the votes were split 8-8, not enough to change the ultimate decision.
        In the twist conclusion, Sandra was summoned into Dumont's office and
        offered her job, but in exchange for his decision, a new African immigrant
        worker - a contracted welder named Alphonse (Serge Koto), wouldn't be
        rehired after September. Sandra responded by declining her job offer.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Unbroken (2014)</b>, 137 minutes, D: Angelina Jolie<br />
        Director Angelina Jolie's WWII biopic was adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's
        2010 biographical, true-to-life account of Italian-American
             Louis &quot;Louie&quot; Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), titled: <i>Unbroken:
            A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption</i>.
            Zamperini had gained fame during the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin
            as a US athlete (nicknamed  &quot;The Torrance Tornado&quot;) when
            he ran a record-breaking pace (56 seconds) in the final lap of the
            5,000 meter race. His future resilience and fortitude came during
            his training years when his brother Pete (Alex Russell) advised: &quot;If
            you can take it, you can make it.&quot; During
            his service during WWII, his bomber-plane crashed and he drifted
            on an inflatable raft (with two other crew members) for 47 days on
            the Pacific before he was captured and became a POW in  Japanese
            prison camps for two years. He suffered and endured continued beatings,
            abuse and torture from a particularly cruel and sadistic Japanese
            officer named Sgt. Mutsuhiro &quot;The Bird&quot; Watanabe (Japanese
            pop star Miyavi). At the end of the war, the Allies liberated the
            camps and Louie was freed. The epilogue of the film was a documentary-styled
            review of Louie's life after the war, including his marriage and
            family life, his religious faith and devotion, and his participation
            in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan.</font></p>

          <font size="2">In this intensely-dramatic coming-of-age tale,  talented
              19 year-old young drummer/percussionist Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller)
              was a first-year student in an elite NYC musical conservatory (the
              fictional Shaffer Conservatory) under the tutelage of notorious
              studio jazz band conductor Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons). After
              being recruited as an alternate drummer in the band, Andrew soon
              learned that Fletcher had a reputation for abusiveness, cruelty
              (physical and emotional), harsh language, and ruthlessness in reaching
              perfection. Andrew's aspirations and dreams of greatness were challenged
              as he attempted to meet the demands of his taskmaster. As events
              transpired, including Andrew's expulsion from Shaffer for attacking
              Fletcher  in an instance of extreme exasperation, it was revealed
              that Andrew was only one in a series of Fletcher's tutored and
              tortured victims - a previous student named Sean Casey had hanged
              himself in suicidal despair over Fletcher's abusive techniques.
              An ethics legal complaint filed against Fletcher, with Andrew serving
              as one of the anonymous witnesses, resulted in Fletcher's firing
              from Shaffer. Afterwards, Andrew and Fletcher met up and agreed
              to perform together at a jazz festival concert, culminating in
              a battle of talent and wits on-stage between the vengeful Fletcher
              (who knew that Andrew had testified against him) and the indomitable
              Andrew who was determined to succeed. </font></p></td>

          115 minutes, D: Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e<br />
          This biographical adventure drama was based upon the 2012 memoirs of
          Cheryl Strayed titled <i>Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific
          Crest Trail</i> - an account of her solo, life-affirming, three-and-a-half
          month, 1,100-mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail, from California
          to Portland, OR. After the 1991 death of her beloved mother Bobbi Grey
          (Laura Dern) when she was 22 years old, Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon)
          began a streak of self-destructive behavior. She knew that her mother
          had suffered badly from her mentally and physically abusive father
          Ronald Nylund (Jason Newell), and became so depressed and emotionally
          pained by the loss that she sank into drug use (and heroin addiction),
          and promiscuous sex (leading to an aborted pregnancy). Her domestic
          life went into a downward spiral that destroyed her marriage to Paul
          (Thomas Sadoski). Four years later and homeless, she became determined
          to take an arduous back-packing trek along part of the PCT. It would
          become a journey of self-discovery, redemption, transformation, and
          contemplation, as she looked back on both the good and bad aspects
          of her past during her difficult upbringing in Minneapolis, MN. Along
          the way, she encountered physical hardships and feelings of guilt and
          grief, but was supported by many mostly-helpful and interesting strangers
          (on and off the trail), and began to overcome the demons that had possessed
          her. She encountered a red fox during her trip that she interpreted
          as the spirit of her watchful mother.</font></p>
