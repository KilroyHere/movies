          T</font><font size="2">his entertaining and daring satirical
              black comedy, with a screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky, was about
              the absurdities of war. It was set in 1944 during WWII - the
              main character was charming, callow, larcenous, scheming American
              Navy officer, Lt. Cmdr. Charles E. Madison (James Garner). His
              main job, residing in a swanky London hotel, was to be a  &quot;dog-robber&quot;  -
              to make sure his superior general, commanding officer Rear Adm.
              William Jessup (Melvyn Douglas), was comfortable and supplied
              (with everything from Hershey bars, to liquor, food, and Cokes).
              He was despised and called a womanizer (&quot;a complete rascal&quot;)
              by his prim British war-widow motor-pool chauffeur and ambulance
              driver Miss Emily Barham (Julie Andrews), who had strong anti-American
              prejudices (what he termed: &quot;sentimental contempt&quot;).
              She hated his loud and brash ways, wastefulness, and avowed cowardice
              - although they did have romantic feelings for each other. Their
              situation drastically changed when the commanding admirals decided
              that they wanted the first American casualty of an upcoming dangerous
              mission (the D-Day invasion of Omaha Beach) to be a sailor -
              to be filmed for PR's sake, and Madison was ordered to arrange
              it when Admiral Jessup suffered a nervous breakdown. In the film's
              twisting conclusion, it appeared that Madison was killed by an
              exploding shell on the beach, and was subsequently lauded as
              a hero. However, he was wounded - with Jessup now planning to
              dub him &quot;the first man on Omaha Beach.&quot; </font><font size="2">        <br />

          that occurred over two and a half days between two middle-aged out-of-town

            Evie Jackson (Geraldine Page), a post-mistress from small-town Ohio,

            He was engaged and about to marry shallow widow Phyllis (Angela Lansbury)
            from Altoona, PA (the &quot;tomato from Altoona&quot;). Due to circumstances
            involving his soon-to-be stepson - Phyllis' 18-year-old, college
            student-son Patrick (Michael Anderson, Jr.) and his crazy girlfriend
            Zola (Joanna Crawford), Harry was invited to share a room with Evie.

          Alert</em> by Peter George and a script by Terry Southern. It
          was the first commercially-successful political satire about nuclear
          war, doomsday and Cold War politics. A crazed,
            anti-Communist psychotic US general Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden),
              paranoid about his own sexual potency, sparked a nuclear
              crisis with a pre-emptive strike against &quot;the Russkies.&quot; The
              American President Muffley (Peter Sellers in one of three roles)
              must deal with gung ho military brass Gen. Buck Turgidson (George
              C. Scott), bureaucratic bumbling, an incompetent Soviet ambassador,
              and a twisted, black-gloved German rocket scientist, Dr. Strangelove
              himself (Sellers again). It ended with the memorable bucking bronco
              image of Major Kong (Slim Pickens) riding the fatal bomb and howling
              wildly toward oblivion: &quot;YAHOO!! YAHOO!!&quot;</font></p>          </td>

                  UK)</a>, </b>112 minutes, D: Guy Hamilton<br />
                  The third entry in the long-running series of Bond films  and
                  the first official blockbuster for the franchise.
                  Considered by most viewers as the quintessential 'Bond' film
                  that set many precedents and the formula for future 007 films,
                  including: Sean Connery's definitive portrayal of the MI6 agent,
                  Bond gadgets, iconic 'Bond Girls,' the theme song and pre-credits
                  sequence, classic lines of dialogue, the Aston-Martin, great
                  action sequences, etc. After an initial pre-credits sequence
                  set at a Latin America drug lord's laboratory, Bond (Sean Connery)
                  was dispatched to investigate gold-obsessed bullion dealer-smuggler
                  Auric Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) staying at a Miami hotel. During
                  an affair with Goldfinger's mistress Jill Masterson (Shirley
                  Eaton) there, Bond was knocked unconscious by Goldfinger's
                  mute Korean servant Oddjob (Harold Sakata) with a lethal bowler
                  hat, and Masterson was asphyxiated to death by gold body paint.
                  During Bond's pursuit of Goldfinger to Switzerland, Bond assisted
                  Jill's vengeful sister Tilly (Tania Mallet), but she also lost
                  her life to Oddjob. Bond was captured and subjected to torture
                  via a laser-beam. Bond later pursued Goldfinger at his stud-horse
                  ranch in Kentucky where he learned of Goldfinger's grand plot,
                  known as &quot;Operation
                  Grand Slam,&quot;
          to infiltrate the US Depository at Fort Knox, contaminate the gold
          reserve, and disrupt the world's economy. </font><font size="2">In
          the climactic scene at Ft. Knox, Pussy Galore's Flying Circus (five
          planes) took off and sprayed Delta 9 nerve gas over the Fort Knox area
          and the facility's troops to gain entry, not realizing the canisters
          had been changed. A showdown occurred between Bond and Oddjob, both
          caught inside as a bomb ticked down. Bond cleverly electrocuted Oddjob
          and the timer on the bomb was disarmed. Later, escaping villain Goldfinger
          hijacked Bond's private jet enroute to the White House, but suffered
          death when the plane decompressed by a gunshot and he was sucked through
          a window. Bond and sexy, lesbian-leaning, but converted private pilot
          Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) parachuted to safety into the ocean with
          Bond before being rescued. <i>Goldfinger</i> was
            the first Bond film to win an Academy Award - its sole nomination
              for Best Sound Effects. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>A Hard Day's Night (1964, UK),</b> 90 minutes,
              D: Richard Lester<br />
            The Beatles' first charming, wacky, original and impish movie was
            released not long after the Fab Four's landmark debut appearance
            on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em>. At first thought to be a cross-promotional
            exploitation of their phenomenal 'Beatlemania', even critics agreed
            that it was an inventive, funny and ingenious musical comedy that
            later helped to inspire the music video craze. Innovative American
            director Richard Lester used the same type of goofy humor and imaginative
            visuals from his earlier experimental, grainy, hand-held short film, <em>The
            Running, Jumping and Standing Still Film (1959)</em> starring Peter
            Sellers and Spike Milligan, along with black-and-white film stock
            and a semi-documentary style. Screenwriter Alun Owen based his Oscar-nominated
            script on the group's frenzied popularity, supplemented by musical
            interludes of concert footage. The frantic film documents thirty-six
            hours of the group's life as they are on their way from Liverpool
            to London for a TV performance, marked by the memorable opening intercut
            to the title song - as the singing group is chased by screaming,
            hysterical and obsessed teenage girls while they board a train. The
            rock-and-roll stars express their charming, laid-back, and saucy
            personalities in this slice-of-life film that fictionalized their
            lives -- best exemplified during their interview scenes with their
            dry, playful one-liner responses (Reporter:   &quot;Are you a mod,
            or a rocker?&quot; Ringo: &quot;Um, no. I'm a mocker&quot;). Wilfrid
            Brambell also plays Ringo's &quot;very clean,&quot; eccentric grandfather
            who serves as the film's trouble-maker. The Academy's membership
            unjustly overlooked the now-classic songs in the film's un-nominated
            soundtrack in favor of those from <em>Mary Poppins </em>(&quot;Chim
            Chim Cher-ee&quot;), <em>Dear Heart</em>, <em>Hush...Hush, Sweet
            Charlotte</em>, <em>Robin and the 7 Hoods </em>(&quot;My Kind of
            Town&quot;), and <em>Where Love Has Gone</em>. However, George Martin,
            the Beatles' producer often recognized as the &quot;Fifth Beatle,&quot; was
        nominated for Best Adapted Score.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Marnie (1964), </b>130 minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
            Director  Hitchcock's psychological thriller - a tale of sexual
                perversity, a disturbed psychological state, and obsessive love
                - was a 'sex mystery' with the questioning tagline: &quot;Would
          his touch end Marnie's unnatural fears or start them again?&quot; In
          the film's opening, four brief sequences cleverly and economically
          presented clues to the main character's identity
          and appearance. The  title character Margaret
              'Marnie' Edgar (Tippi Hedren) was introduced as a  con
          artist, liar and compulsive thief (kleptomaniac). With black-dyed hair
          as a disguise, she had stolen $10,000 from her place of work (a tax
          consultancy), and then adopted a new identity (as a natural blonde).
          It revealed a behavioral pattern that she had established for herself.  Marnie
          was then hired as a typist at a Philadelphia
          publishing firm, where the owner - a wealthy widower and
          playboy Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), became romantically involved with
          her, in part as a challenge to try and understand her puzzling nature.
          With a disturbed psyche, Marnie
          was experiencing nightmares, severe panic attacks (occurring during
          a thunderstorm), and a phobic fear of the color red. Although Mark
          had discovered Marnie's embezzlement of funds, he kept her on as an
          employee and strangely blackmailed her into marrying him. During a
          much-debated rape scene, newly-wed husband Mark was with her during
          their honeymoon cruise to Fiji. He kissed her, ripped off her nightgown
          (the silky garment fell to her feet), embraced her, laid on top of
          her on the bed and took her (his face filling the entire screen). The
          sexually-frigid Marnie stared upward in a frozen, paralyzed catatonic
          state - completely lacking any passion or emotion, but then the scene
          cut away to a porthole. The source of Marnie's deep-seated problems,
          phobias, and prudishness were dramatically recalled during a nightmarish
          flashback - an incident that began to purge her problem. As a young
          5 year-old (Melody Thomas Scott), she had witnessed her 20 year-old
          prostitute mother Bernice Edgar (Louise Latham) attacked by sex partner
          and pedophile sailor (Bruce Dern). When the client started to also
          kiss and molest Marnie, and Bernice called out for help, Marnie
          defensively delivered a blow to his head with a fireplace poker - she
          mortally-wounded the seaman, although her mother
          was the one who took the blame and stood trial for the self-defense
          murder. She was desperate for love,
                but couldn't allow a man to be intimately close to her. She had
          almost entirely erased the memory of the killing. The mentally-ill,
          cheating, lying and disturbed Marnie had secretly feared that she wasn't
          loved, and would never be loved or have children, so she compensated
                by stealing and cramming robbed goods into her purse or suitcases
          (a Freudian symbol of her empty womb). In the conclusion, Mark provided
          assurances when he spoke to Marnie to convince her to think more highly
          of herself, and not regard herself as a cheat, a liar and a thief.
          He also vowed to help defend her, told her that she wouldn't go to
          jail, and that they would work out their mutual marital problems.</font></p>          </td>

              Stevenson<br />
              Disney's sugar-coated musical fantasy adaptation of the beloved
              P. L. Travers children's books won an Oscar for Best Original Score
              (&quot;Chim-Chim-Cher-ee&quot;),
              and featured Academy Award-winning Special Effects with its  
              amazing blending of live action with animated cartoon characters,
              plus audio animatronics (i.e., the robin). A sequel came many years
              later, <i>Mary Poppins Returns (2018)</i>, starring Emily Blunt.
              In the film's opening title sequence, prim and proper nanny
              Mary Poppins (Oscar-winner Julie Andrews in her film debut) was
              sitting on a cloud over Edwardian-era London with her talking parrot-headed
              umbrella while applying makeup. She was summoned to the Banks family's
              household at 17 Cherry Tree Lane after the children, Jane (Karen
              Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber), wrote their own advertisement
              for a kind and sweet nanny, in opposition to their father's demands:
              (&quot;Wanted,
              a nanny for two adorable children...(sung) If you want this choice
              position, have a cheery disposition...Rosy cheeks, no warts, play
              games, all sort. You must be kind, you must be witty, very sweet
              and fairly pretty, take us on outings, give us treats, sing songs,
          bring sweets...&quot;). She materialized as per their wishes, dropped
          down and entered at a  window
          (the children exclaimed: &quot;It's her. It's the person. She's answered
          our advertisement. Rosy cheeks and everything&quot;). Both parents,
          stodgy banker-father Mr. George W. Banks (David Tomlinson) and his
          oblivious, distracted wife and suffragette Mrs. Winifred Banks (Glynis
          Johns), needed a replacement nanny to help put their upset house in
          order. By singing songs to the children (&quot;A Spoonful of Sugar&quot; for
          example), she was able to easily discipline and coax them to behave
          and learn some of life's lessons. Carefree Cockney sidewalk street
          entertainer-artist (screever) Bert (Dick Van Dyke) was introduced to
          the kids. In a fabulous segment, the group jumped into a chalk sketch
          on the pavement that took Mary, Bert and the Banks children into an
          animated world, where they sang the catchy classic tune about a nonsense
          word: &quot;Super-califragilistic-expialidocious.&quot; In another
          fantasy adventure, Mary visited with them at the home of Bert's jolly
          Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) for a cheerful tea party held while floating
          to the ceiling (&quot;I Love to Laugh&quot;). Another time before the
          children visited their father's bank, Mary poignantly sang: &quot;Feed
          the Birds&quot; (pigeons),
          about an old bird woman (Jane Darwell in her final screen appearance)
          who would be selling breadcrumbs at St. Paul's Cathedral. Later, during
          Bert's cleaning of the Banks' living-room chimney, the scene moved
          up to the rooftop for a manic, fireworks-filled dance &quot;Step
          In Time&quot; by Bert and his fellow chimney-sweeps - it evolved into
          a huge Irish jig dance number on rooftops over London while dodging
          fireworks and cannon-blasts. In the film's major turning point, Mr.
          Banks told off his bank founder boss and chairman
          of the board - the elderly Mr. Dawes, Sr. (also Van Dyke): &quot;Go
          fly a kite!&quot; during his own dismissal. Happy now that he no longer
          worked at the stuffy bank, both he and Mrs. Banks took the children
          to the park for kite-flying (&quot;Let's Go Fly a Kite&quot;). In the
          triumphant finale, Mr. Banks was rehired and given a promotion by transformed,
          kite-flying Mr. Dawes who had a change of heart. With all of her tasks
          fulfilled, Mary Poppins took to the skies and sailed away.</font></p>          </td>

            Best Director-winning George Cukor's Best Picture-winning film was
            one of the best and most popular musicals of all-time. 
            It was adapted from Lerner and Loewe's Broadway musical play of the
            same name that ran for six years (1956-1962), that the two writers
             based on George Bernard Shaw's 1913 staged play <em>Pygmalion
            </em>that he had adapted
            from his own 1912 writings. The entire premise of all the derivations
            came from Latin poet Ovid's story of Pygmalion in his <i>Metamorphoses</i>. Arrogant,
            fastidious, and misogynistic linguistics Professor Henry Higgins
            (Rex Harrison repeating his Tony Award-winning performance on Broadway)
            in London casually wagered and challenged fellow linguist Colonel
            Hugh Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) that he could transform a poor,
            Cockney flower-selling, street urchin Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn)
            - a 'guttersnipe' - into a proper lady with prescribed diction/elocution
            lessons, so that she could obtain a respectable job working in a
            flower shop rather than selling flowers on the street. The
              irrepressible 'guttersnipe' was scrubbed, dressed, and tutored
              by her impatient and tyrannical teacher. During her torturous
              six-month elocution lessons (such as &quot;The
              rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain&quot;), she suddenly caught
              on how to speak with a proper upper-class accent. Her unrepentant,
              calculating drunk father Alfred P. Doolittle (Stanley Holloway),
              a dustman, saw an opportunity to get rich (&quot;With a Little Bit of
              Luck&quot;). He appeared at Higgins' residence for a handout and was
              bought off. Eliza  made an embarrassing first public appearance at the opening day Ascot
              Races, where she appeared to make a good impression initially,
              until by the racecourse, she shouted out in a vulgar Cockney accent:  &quot;C'mon
            Dover, move your bloomin' arse!&quot; She also
            caught the eye of high-born aristocratic suitor, a poor Freddy Eynsford-Hill
            (Jeremy Brett), who was interested in romance (&quot;On the Street
            Where You Live&quot;), and a love triangle formed. She
            posed as a mysterious noble duchess at an Embassy ball, and was a
            personal triumph within the Edwardian high society. There, a Hungarian
            phonetics specialist Zoltan Karpathy (Theodore Bikel) trained by
            Higgins vowed she had to be an imposter. He claimed that she couldn't
            be English because her speech was so impeccable for a native. Eliza
              won her reluctant teacher's love, but then stormed off after being
              transformed (and Higgins won the bet) when her callous tutor 
              wouldn't acknowledge her hard work or allow her kindness and even
              a certain degree of equality (&quot;Why Can't a Woman Be More
              Like a Man?&quot;). Although she was about ready to marry
              Freddy, Higgins realized that he really had an affection for Eliza:
              (&quot;I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face&quot;) - and she returned to him
              by film's end. She appeared in his doorway with her old accent: &quot;I
              washed my hands and face before I come, I did.&quot; The film concluded
              with Higgins' final line, asking for his slippers that Eliza had
              earlier thrown at him: &quot;&quot;Eliza ... Where the devil are
            my slippers?&quot;</font></p>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Pawnbroker (1964), </b>114 minutes, D: Sidney
              Lumet<br />
Director Sidney Lumet's mainstream, documentary-styled, b/w, socially-conscious
psychological urban melodrama (shot on location) was replete with a number of
quick flashbacks and montages to reveal the protagonist's horrific remembered-past
as a concentration camp survivor. It was the first US film to show a woman nude
from the waist up with bare breasts that was granted a Production Code seal because
the nakedness was integral to the story, and the film was enhanced with a jazzy
Quincy Jones score. The opening prologue was a slow-motion, nostalgic, and idyllic
mid-summer memory of a young, happy Jewish man (a university professor) with
his wife, his children and older relatives in an open country meadow, when suddenly
the images were jarred or interrupted by an unknown menace (the arrival of German
Nazi officials in a car). Twenty years after the
            war (and after his wife's death), Nazi concentration camp sole survivor
            and emotionally withdrawn, embittered pawnbroker Sol Nazerman (Best
            Actor-nominated Rod Steiger) worked in a grimy, claustrophobic Spanish
            and East Harlem pawnshop (at 116th St. and Park Ave.), and supportively
              lived with his sister-in-law Bertha (Nancy R. Pollack) in a suburban
              home on Long Island, with her two squabbling teenaged children.
            He had a distant relationship with Tessie (Marketa Kimbrell) (another
            camp survivor) with whom he slept and played cards, and he supported
            both Tessie and her father-in-law Mendel (Baruch Lumet). Sol also
            suffered through a cold acquaintanceship with friendly, middle-aged
spinster social welfare worker Marilyn Birchfield (Geraldine Fitzgerald).
            Sol's shop assistant was  brash, ambitious young Puerto Rican Jesus
            Ortiz (Jaime Sanchez), a reformed criminal, who was interested in
            a friendship and mentoring relationship with the closed-off Sol.
            Throughout the film, a series of quick-cutting flashbacks represented
            Sol's disturbing and associative memories of concentration
            camp horrors. Sol became very concerned and suffered a crisis of
            conscience when he learned that his silent black business partner-backer
            Rodriguez (Brock Peters), a local crime boss, was using the unprofitable
            pawnshop as an illegal front to launder money for his rackets - and
            brothel businesses. The fact that the pawnshop was being used to
            promote prostitution was a trigger to recall  memories of
            his dead wife's rape in the concentration camp. After Sol told Rodriguez
            that he refused to accept money from a brothel, he was beaten into
            submission to comply. In the film's most  controversial
            scene, a black prostitute (Thelma Oliver), Jesus' girlfriend who
            was employed by Rodriguez, bared her breasts for Sol in exchange
            for money.  Because Sol interpreted
            sex as dark and evil, he covered the young topless woman with her
            raincoat, and gave her a $20 dollar bill. After learning about Jesus'
            and the hooker's connections to Rodriguez, Sol cruelly
            denounced the young boy (and any association with him) and told him: &quot;You
            are nothing to me.&quot; Jesus became involved with old criminal
            neighborhood buddies in a plot to rob the shop. He was prompted to
            turn spiteful against his employer Sol, after Sol's cruel
            comment, but Jesus insisted to his accomplices that no guns would
            be used during the robbery. However, in the depressing and tragic
            conclusion, an armed robbery was led by a neighborhood gang leader
            Tangee (Raymond St. Jacques) and two thugs - the theft was connected
            and visualized as the ominous arrival of the three German officials
            in the film's opening. The thugs mercilessly beat up Sol when he
            refused to cooperate and turn over money to them. During
            the assault, Jesus stepped in to try and save Sol when a gun was
            aimed at him, and he was accidentally hit by the gunshot - Jesus
            crawled out to the sidewalk and died in the street, after confessing: &quot;I
            said no shootin'. No to hurt you.&quot; Sol realized that Jesus had
            sacrificed his life for him - and attempted to scream with his mouth
            grimacing and wide open, but with no sound emerging. Shockingly
            and cathartically, Sol's skewered and punctured his hand on a sharp
            metal receipt spindle in the shop used to hold pawn tickets or receipts
            - the self-inflicted wound was intended to force him to feel the
            physical pain and restore his humanity.</font></p>
