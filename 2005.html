              Kusama <br />
  This high-action, futuristic sci-fi thriller  was set  in the walled, fictional
        city-state and utopian haven of Bregna, a post-apocalyptic society in
        the year 2415. A small number of inhabitants
        were forced to live under the rule of the totalitarian Goodchild dynasty
        of genetic scientists. A devastating lethal virus in 2011 had killed
        99% of the population (leaving only 5 million people) and had caused
        everyone else who survived to become sterile. Mysterious
        assassin-rebel and trained freedom fighter Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron)
        worked for a group of underground, anti-government rebels (led by
        the Handler (Frances McDormand)) known as Monicans. Aeon Flux was
        assigned by the Handler to sabotage the Goodchild regime's central
        surveillance facility, defeat the regime, and eliminate its mastermind
        scientist and Chairman Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas), who had
        descended from the man who found a cure for the virus.  After the murder
  by government agents of Aeon's sister Una (Amelia Warner) who was found to
  be pregnant, Aeon disobeyed
  orders to kill Trevor and decided to protect him. He revealed
  deep secrets to her about the past - decades earlier while researching a cure,
  the original population had been cloned over seven generations, to ensure a
  population. Since everyone in Bregna was a clone grown from recycled DNA, many
  of the descendants of the original population were now unexplainedly disappearing,
  and/or experiencing troubling and destablizing symptoms (loss of sleep, bad
  dreams, incomplete memories of past lives, etc.). There were efforts being
  made to reverse the infertility problem. But nature was also beginning
            to find a way to overcome the sterility issue and women were again
            becoming pregnant naturally. In a subplot regarding a conspiracy,
            Trevor's evil younger brother Oren Goodchild (Jonny Lee Miller)
            was scheming to stage a coup - he wanted to destroy Trevor's experimental
            lab work and research to find a cure for sterility (and repopulate
            the city). Oren was also the one responsible for the murder of  Una.
  His plan was to kill the clones which were now reproducing, to maintain the
  power and continuity of the Goodchild dynasty. Oren also wanted to kill Aeon
  by destroying her DNA. In
  the finale, Aeon went against both Oren and her former allies by killing Oren.
  On a mission to destroy the Relical, a giant blimp/dirigible that circled
  above the city (and housed the main DNA library or storage system
  used for cloning), Aeon learned from the 400 year old hologramic Keeper (Pete
  Postlethwaite) inside the blimp that she was the clone of Trevor's
  wife from 400 years earlier, and was named &quot;Katherine.&quot; Years ago,
  the Keeper had rescued her, and had preserved and hidden her DNA,
  although Oren had ordered it to be destroyed. Oren hadn't wanted &quot;Katherine&quot; to
  influence Trevor. The Keeper had now brought her back - since the
  time was right - to &quot;reach
            Trevor&quot; - to show him that his &quot;perfect&quot; world wasn't
            so perfect. The Keeper was now ready to die since his mission was
            completed. Aeon Flux destroyed the &quot;Relical&quot; by
            planting explosives inside it - and as it descended, it crashed into
            the outer wall of Bregna and exposed the population to the outside,
            lushly-green jungle world, thought to be a wasteland. &quot;Katherine&quot; was
            reunited with Trevor - they joined hands: &quot;Now we can move forward,
            to live once for real, and then give way to people who might do it
            better.&quot; The last scene was 400 years earlier, when Katherine
            and Trevor, girlfriend and boyfriend, spoke to each other on a street: &quot;Hey,
            Katherine. Will I see you again?&quot; She smiled back, and the voice-over
            concluded that now, everyone had just one life remaining to live
            - and they were free to choose their own destiny: &quot;To live only
          once - but with hope.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

            This film was a reboot of the Caped Crusader franchise-series, following
            the failure of the two previous films: <i><a href="series-batman3.html">Batman
            Forever (1995)</a></i> and
            <i><a href="series-batman4.html">Batman &amp; Robin (1997)</a></i> and
            an 8-year gap. It was the first film in a so-called &quot;Dark Knight

            The superhero action-thriller crime drama (told with criss-crossing
            flashbacks) opened with the origin story of young Bruce Wayne (Gus
            Lewis as youth) - born into wealth and his father's business Wayne
            Enterprises. In crime-ridden Gotham City, 8 year-old Wayne watched
            as his parents Dr. Thomas (Linus Roache) and Martha (Sara Stewart)
            were mugged and killed by street criminal Joe Chill (Richard Brake)
            in an alleyway when they left an opera performance early. Orphaned
            Bruce was then raised by the family's butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael
            Caine). Traumatized by his parents' deaths and his own phobic fear
			of bats, 14 years later, vengeful billionaire playboy Bruce (Christian
			Bale as adult) was intent on vigilante justice by murdering paroled
			Joe Chill, who was to be released if he testified against his cellmate,
            gang and drug boss Carmine &quot;The Roman&quot; Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). But
			before Bruce could act, a blonde female  reporter-assassin (Catherine
			Porter) lethally shot Chill. He was encouraged to search for answers
			by his childhood friend and romantic sweetheart Rachel Dawes (Katie
			Holmes), the city's Assistant DA who believed in true justice, not
			revenge. For the next 7 years, Bruce relocated to Asia where he was
			mentored by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). He was invited to be trained
			in martial arts and joined to a mysterious group of vigilantes and
			assassins known as the League of Shadows. He also met with Ra's al
			Ghul (Ken Watanabe), the head of the League (later revealed as a
			decoy for the real leader). Once Bruce returned to Gotham City years
			later, he was presumed dead. It was an opportunity for Bruce to fight
			crime in the Gotham underworld with a new persona - Batman, and to
			live by day as a philanthropic playboy. He was assisted with his new identity
			(a masked
			Bat body-suit and a Batmobile Tumbler) by Alfred and Wayne Enterprises
			gadgets-maker Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). He resided in a Bat-Cave
			beneath Wayne Manor. His first target was shady psycho-pharmacologist
			Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) (aka the insane Scarecrow) at
			Arkham Asylum, who had plotted with the underworld (and drug smuggler
			Falcone). His plan was to expose all of Gotham's residents to a smuggled,
			fear-inducing toxic substance put in the water supply. The Scarcrow
			also revealed he was working for Ra's al Ghul, whose true leader was Henri
			Ducard! Ra's al Ghul's more dastardly plan was to vaporize Gotham's water
            supply with a microwave emitter, sending Crane's drug airborne to
            destroy the city and cause mass hysteria. He first set Wayne Manor
            ablaze, where Bruce was revived and rescued by Alfred. And then in
            an exciting action sequence, Batman fought Ra's al Ghul who was riding
            in the city's monorail with the emitter bound for Wayne Tower (in
            the center of Gotham). Their brutal struggle ended with the villain's
            death in a monumental train crash. Batman was heralded as the city's
            hero, as he further allied himself with honest police officer Sgt.
            James Gordon (Gary Oldman) (now promoted to Lieutenant), to continue
            fighting crime. From now on, Batman would be summoned with a Bat-Signal
            shining like a searchlight in the night sky, to fight the next evil
            criminal - the Joker! </font></p>        </td>

              Ang Lee<br />
          Best Director-winning Ang Lee's landmark and poignant, forbidden love
          story (and modern-day western) was about a 20 year relationship (1963-1983)
          between two married bi-sexual  cowboys. The
          two who fell in love were 19 year-old Wyoming ranch-hand Ennis Del
          Mar (Best Actor-nominated Heath Ledger) and aspiring rodeo cowboy Jack
          Twist (Best Supporting Actor-nominated Jake Gyllenhaal). Their first
          meeting in the summer of 1963 was as innocently-exuberant skinny-dippers
          in a pond, when the two ranchers worked together as sheep-herders near
          Brokeback Mountain. Ennis rebuffed Jack's daring attempt to kiss him
          and to mutually touch each other, but then returned sheepishly with
          his hat in hand and accepted their first kiss, before their first sexual
          experience (anal intercourse) together. It was an under-one-minute
          sexual encounter in a shared sleeping bag in a two-man tent. They seriously
          struggled in their awkward relationship, and after their summer together,
          both were married. Ennis wed fragile, waifish Alma
          Beers (Best Supporting Actress-nominated Michelle Williams) - with
          two daughters, and Jack tied the knot with tomboyish rodeo queen Lureen
          Newsome (Anne Hathaway) - with one son. Due to their conflicted feelings,
          both experienced strained marriages. Four years later in 1967, the
          two had a reunion in Wyoming. The two hugged each other tightly, as
          Ennis nervously looked around, then forcefully grabbed Jack and pushed
          him into a secluded spot by stairs where they kissed hungrily, while
          Ennis' wife Alma accidentally spied on their embracing passion from
          above and turned away. However, the two infrequently met for 'fishing'
          trips - but suspiciously never brought home any of their catch. In
          1975, Alma and Ennis divorced, and Alma took custody of the two daughters.
          Now that Ennis was free, Jack suggested that they retreat to a small
          ranch to live together, but Ennis rejected the idea of abandoning his
          family, and facing anger from locals for being &quot;queer.&quot; Even
          so, they continued to meet a few times a year in Wyoming, where Jack
          would drive to meet up. By 1978, Jack's marriage had also deteriorated,
          but the two still could not agree to live together. Some time
            after Jack's death in 1980, the anguished Ennis learned of his passing.
            Lureen told him that Jack had died while changing a tire that exploded,
            although Ennis imagined it as a gay-bashing homophobic incident in
            a field. Jack's parents disagreed with their son's wishes to spread
            his ashes at Brokeback Mountain. Ennis visited
            Jack's parents at their home, and discovered blood-stained shirts
            in Jack's childhood bedroom closet. The shirts belonged to himself
            and ex-lover Jack from when they fought together years earlier on
            Brokeback Mountain in 1963. Ennis held the intertwined shirts (Jack's
            shirt was on the outside) to his face and breathed in their scent.
          When he left, he took the shirts with him. Broke and lonely, Ennis
          lived in a trailer, where in 1983, he was visited by his 19-year-old
          daughter Alma Jr. (Kate Mara), who told him that she was engaged -
          she invited him to the wedding. In the melodramatic ending, Ennis
              went to his trailer closet where he again saw their two old
            shirts (hanging in the back of his closet). The two shirts were both
            together on one hanger, intertwined but reversed - Jack's blood-stained
            shirt was now covered by Ennis's. He also saw a postcard of Brokeback
            Mountain tacked next to the shirts and straightened it - he tearfully
            and regretfully cried about their forbidden homosexual love affair:
            (&quot;Jack, I swear...&quot;).</font></p>          </td>

              111 minutes, D: Michael Haneke<br />
              In this dark and dramatic psychological thriller about repressed
              childhood guilt, an upper-middle class couple were introduced living
              in a modern townhouse in Paris: host of a TV literary review show
              Georges Laurent (Daniel Auteuil) and his publisher wife Anne Laurent
              (Juliette Binoche), with their 12-year-old son Pierrot (Lester
              Makedonsky). Without explanation, the family began to receive anonymously-delivered
              parcels of videotapes, along with morbid, childlike drawings (of
              a boy's face with blood coming from his mouth, and of a bleeding
              chicken's neck). The mysterious videos revealed that the family
              was being surveilled or monitored from the street (day and night).
              More drawings arrived at Georges's workplace and Pierrot's school.
              Although interpreted as menacing and intrusive, the French police
              regarded the items as non-criminal. A third videotape viewed the
              estate where Georges grew up - pointing to the inescapable conclusion
              that the images were flashbacks that referred to Georges' haunted
              childhood memories. He recalled how at the end of France's Algerian
              War (1954-1962), an Algerian family working as farmhands at his
              parents' estate had a boy named Majid (Malik Nait Djoudi as child).
              [Note: The parents were killed during an anti-government demonstration
              and massacre in 1961, and their bodies were thrown in the Seine
              River.] As a six-year old, Georges (Hugo Flamigni as youth) had
              jealously resisted the idea of his parents adopting the orphaned
              boy by telling lies about him. Georges directed Majid to behead
              the family's rooster with an axe (and allegedly menaced him too),
              and soon after, Majid was sent back to the orphanage. Another videotape
              provided clues that led Georges, during his search for answers,
              to the street and address (# 049) of the now-grown, 40 year-old
              Majid (Maurice B&eacute;nichou), living alone in Romainville. 
			  In a short confrontational scene with
              him (that left Majid distraught and crying), Georges' conversation
              with him was again secretly recorded, and the tape was sent to
              Georges' employer (Bernard Le Coq). Meanwhile, the Laurent's son
              Pierrot disappeared (and Majid and his son (Walid Afkir) were
               suspected but innocent), but later, Pierrot reappeared unharmed. After
              the incident, Georges returned to Majid's apartment. After Majid
              again denied involvement in the tapes, he suicidally slashed his
              throat in Georges' presence. Afterwards, Georges suspected Majid's
              son of being responsible for the tapes. The son replied by asking
              Georges how he felt about being responsible for Majid's death.
              In the final scene, Pierrot and Majid's son were speaking together
              at their high school - were they co-conspirators? </font></p>          </td>

            Based upon   Gerald Clarke's 1988 biography <i>Capote</i>, this biographical
                drama followed events surrounding homosexual novelist-author
            Truman Capote's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) investigative research and
            authorship of his first non-fictional book <i>In Cold
            Blood</i>,
            published in 1966. In November of 1959, multiple cold-blooded murders
            were committed at the Cutter family's rural Holcomb, KS  farmhouse.
            He ventured to Kansas to the crime scene with his close friend and
            aspiring writer Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), where he gathered
            information on the case from Kansas
          Bureau of Investigation agent Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), with his
          interested wife Marie Dewey (Amy Ryan). Although Capote's original
          intent was to write a <i>New Yorker</i> magazine article, he decided
          to expand the story to a full-length non-fiction novel. In the
          process of his investigation, Capote creepily befriended both homicidal
          murder suspects - Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard &quot;Dick&quot;
          Hickock (Mark Pellegrino). With his celebrity status, Capote was able
          to gain access to them through his charismatic charm, and through bribes
          to Warden Marshall Krutch (Marshall Bell). With the remorseful and
          more sensitive suspect Smith in particular, the narcissistic Capote
          became emotionally close and recognized in him a mutually-kindred nature
          and self-deluded guilty spirit. He felt compassionate for Smith and
          intervened in his case, while at the same time (with mixed motives)
          was frustrated by delays and unable to find closure
          for his book. Capote  became part of the story itself as time dragged
          on and the case went through various appeals, new lawyers and postponed
          execution dates. The exploitative, self-serving and manipulative
          writer  was eventually able to coax intimate and
          horrific details about the night of the murders from Smith's testimony.
          At the end of his shattering book-venture, Capote began to self-medicate
          by drinking heavily while failing to recognize his own part in betraying
          Smith's trust. He reluctantly attended the execution of both Smith
          and Hickok in April of 1965. In the film's epilogue, it was stated
          that Capote, who had personally-unraveled although was now more famous
        than ever before, never wrote another book. </font></p>        </td>

          of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (2005)</a>,</b> 139
          minutes, D: Andrew Adamson<br />
        From the 7-book series of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; novels
        written by C.S. Lewis, three epic movies were adapted (from his books
        published from 1950-1952), including <i><a href="series-chroniclesnarnia.html">The
        Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)</a></i>,
        <i><a href="series-chroniclesnarnia2.html">Prince Caspian (2008)</a></i>,
        and <i><a href="series-chroniclesnarnia3.html">The Voyage of the Dawn
        Treader (2010)</a></i>. See <a href="series-chroniclesnarnia.html"><em>The
        Chronicles of Narnia</em></a> series. All of the family and children-friendly
        films followed the fanciful adventures of four British Pevensie siblings
        in the kingdom of Narnia, where a benevolent, Christ-like lion named
        Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) was the true king, and there were antagonistic
        forces including the evil White Witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton) who had frozen
        Narnia in the Hundred Years Winter. The film opened during the London
        Blitz when the four Pevensie children, the eldest Peter (William Moseley),
        Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes),  and the youngest Lucy
        (Georgie Henley) were safely evacuated by train to the countryside to
        reside in an estate with eccentric Professor Digory Kirke (Jim Broadbent),
        with housekeeper Mrs. Macready (Elizabeth Hawthorne). During a game of
        hide and seek, all of the children were soon to enter a large wardrobe
        (or armoire) that functioned as a portal to Narnia - a fanciful place
        with talking animals, including a flute-playing faun (half-man, half-goat)
        named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy) and anthropomorphic beavers. The narcissistic,
        tyrannical and power-hungry White Witch had cursed and condemned Narnia,
        Aslan's kingdom, to perpetual and eternal winter without Christmas or
        Spring or Summer. Edmund was briefly seduced by a sweet 'Turkish Delight'
        candy snack offered by the pale Witch (who claimed she was the Queen
        of Narnia), and then kidnapped and taken prisoner - to be used as bait
        to capture his siblings. Upon meeting Father Christmas (James Cosmo),
        each of the other 3 siblings received weapon-gifts to save Edmund and
        the kingdom: Lucy (a healing red cordial and small dagger), Susan (magical
        ivory horn and quiver with arrows), and Peter (a sword and shield). After
        evading the Witch's wolves led by Maugrim (voice of Michael Madsen),
        the  children met the mystical Aslan in his war camp, and vowed 
        to help Aslan  restore his kingdom. They believed it was
        their destiny to fulfill the prophesy of being the 'chosen ones.'
        If two sons of Adam (Peter and Edmund) and two daughters of Eve
        (Susan and Lucy), human beings in other words, sat on the four
        thrones, the White Witch's winter and reign would end. After the rescue
        of Edmund, the Witch visited Aslan's camp to again claim him, when Aslan
        sacrificially offered himself to her on a Stone Table and was fatally
        executed by stabbing. The beknighted Peter assembled and led Aslan's
        army to battle the Witch's invading army, as Aslan was magically resurrected.
        Aslan joined the battle in progress, confronted the witch, and broke
        her neck with his giant jaws. Aslan's forces entered the Witch's palace-castle
        to free her petrified Narnian prisoners. As foretold, the Pevensies were
        crowned and enthroned as King Peter the Magnificent, Queen Susan the
        Gentle, King Edmund the Just, and Queen Lucy the Valiant. The film ended
        15 years later, when the young adults left the kingdom of Narnia by tumbling
        back through the wardrobe, discovering that they hadn't aged a single
        day.</font></p>          </td>

              D: Fernando Meirelles<br />
              Based upon John Le Carre's 2001 novel about political intrigue,
              this engrossing and suspenseful dramatic thriller was told with
              flashbacks. The story was propelled by the mysterious brutal murder
              of Amnesty Int'l social-activist wife Tessa Abbott-Quayle (Rachel
              Weisz) - an outspoken care worker in the cluttered, AIDS-ravaged
              shantytowns of Nairobi, Kenya. Her corpse (and the body of her
              Kenyan driver) were found in the dried and cracked arid shore of
              Lake Turkana in remote NW Kenya - both dead from a suspected bandit
              raid. It was discovered that her driver was actually handsome,
              African co-worker/colleague Dr. Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kound&eacute;)
              with whom she may have committed infidelties (although he was revealed
              to be gay). Suspicions that he may have arranged her murder ended.
              Newly-widowed, passive British diplomat-husband Justin Quayle (Ralph
              Fiennes) was motivated to commence a risky, obsessive and death-defying
              mission to discover the reason for his wife's death. It was discovered
              that the core reason for the deaths included evidence of malpractice
              by a Canadian multinational corporation (KDH Pharmaceuticals),
              involved in pharmaceutical corruption and greed. Justin's big-wig
              boss Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) in the Foreign Office,
              who also supervised Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston), the acting head
              of the British High Commission, was leading the conspiracy with
              big pharma, that was recklessly and unethically testing its TB
              drug Dypraxa (with potential harmful side-effects) on the unsuspecting
              Kenyan population. The strident and dedicated Tessa had uncovered
              the truth of the damaging conspiracy from her work in the villages
              - and had lobbied to have the drug tested and redesigned - a very
              costly and lengthy process. Obviously, she had been killed to end
              and silence her objections. After the diligent horticulturalist
              (&quot;constant
              gardener&quot;) learned the truth
            of the conspiracy and why Tessa was murdered, Justin returned to
            the place of her death to await assassins that he knew would be sent
            to kill him. At Justin's church funeral, Tessa's cousin Arthur
            &quot;Ham&quot; Hammond (Richard McCabe) read outloud
            an intercepted, incriminating letter (mailed to him by Justin just
            before his death). It was written by Bernard Pellegrin to Sandy Woodrow
            about the scandal. It uncovered their plan to &quot;keep a tighter
            rein,&quot;
            block and deny Tessa's reports and inquiries into the company's corruption:
            (&quot;The issue here is deniability. If nobody told us Dypraxa was
            causing deaths, we can't be held responsible&quot;). The Quayles
            were both vindicated through their murders. Justin hadn't committed
            suicide, but was killed - he suffered from eight bullet wounds from
            three different guns. Pellegrin departed from the ceremony hounded
            by inquisitive journalists.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Crash (2004/2005, US/Germ.),</b> 114 minutes,
              D: Paul Haggis<br />
              The Best Picture-winner of the eligible 2005 films was writer/director
              Paul Haggis' R-rated ensemble film, a highly-contrived crime drama
              with belief-defying coincidental, intertwining stories and inter-related
              (stereotyped) characters. The themes were urban alienation, racism,
              anger, and fear involving whites, blacks, Latinos, Asians, and
              Iranians in Los Angeles, CA. The tagline of the message movie explained
              the film's title: &quot;Moving
              at the speed of life, we are bound to collide [or crash into] with
              each other.&quot; The plot that covered a 36-hour period began
              with events that introduced two detectives: African-American
              Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his Latino partner-lover Ria (Jennifer
              Esposito), who after a car accident, racially clashed with
              the female Asian driver Kim Lee (Alexis Rhee). A flashback returned
              to the previous day, in an LA gun shop where the white owner (Jack
              McGee) argued with a Persian customer, an Iranian shop-keeper named
              Farhad (Shaun Toub). Farhad was there with his daughter Dorri (Bahar
              Soomekh) to buy a gun for his family's protection following the
              9/11 attacks. That evening, a violent car-jacking by two blacks
              (Anthony (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) and Peter (Larenz
              Tate)) targeted a white couple: LA District Attorney Rick Cabot
              (Brendan Fraser) and his bigoted wife Jean (Sandra Bullock). In
              the stolen black Lincoln Navigator SUV, the two thieves struck
              and seriously injured an innocent pedestrian, an unidentified Asian
              man (a &quot;Chinaman&quot;)
               (later revealed to actually be a Korean man named Park (Daniel
              Dae Kim) - a human trafficker!). Meanwhile, heavily-tattooed, often-discriminated
              against Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) was
              on his second job of the night at Farhad's shop (after being treated
              inappropriately at the Cabot house), repairing a lock on a defective
              door. In another part of the city, two uniformed policemen were
              identified as racist cop Sergeant John Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his
              rookie partner Officer Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Hansen (Ryan Phillippe).
              Recently, Ryan was upset about his ailing  'Pop' (Bruce Kirby)
              and argued with his African-American HMO administrator Shaniqua
              Johnson (Loretta Devine) over pain medication. The two cops pulled
              over an SUV driven by a well-to-do black couple: TV director Cameron
              Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his attractive but drunk wife Christine
              (Thandie Newton). (She was performing oral sex on him before the
              arrest.) During a humiliating, sexualized body-search, Ryan touched
              Christine's private parts while patting her down, causing the conflicted
              Hansen to regard it as an injustice. Shortly later at another accident
              scene, Sgt. Ryan heroically rescued Christine from an overturned
              vehicle after a crash. The two black car-jackers also assaulted
              Cameron driving his SUV, and responding Officer Hansen, with the
              previous incident with Ryan on his mind, dropped any potential
              charges. Then, off-duty Officer Hansen picked up suspicious-looking
              car-jacker Peter who had fled from the earlier crime-scene. During
              their tense drive back, Hansen fearfully shot Peter, hid his corpse,
              and burned his car. It was revealed that Peter was Detective Waters'
              missing younger brother. Waters was subsequently disowned by his
              drug-addicted mother (Beverly Todd) for not finding Peter alive.
              After Farhad's shop was vandalized earlier, the vengeful shopowner
              assaulted locksmith Daniel at his home with a gun (fortunately
              loaded with .38 blanks accidentally purchased by Dorri), after
              suspecting him in the robbery. Daniel's young 5 year-old daughter
              had also saved him by jumping into his arms. The final incident
              was Anthony's theft of the white van of the injured and hospitalized
              Korean pedestrian (the husband of the Asian woman in the film's
              first crash), when he discovered several Thai and Cambodian refugees
              chained in the back. He drove to Chinatown to set them free, and
              then  noticed
              another crash - Shaniqua was
        involved in a minor fender bender.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)</b>,
            119/122 minutes, D: Scott Derrickson <i><b><br />
            </b></i>Director Scott Derrickson's supernatural horror film
            (and courtroom drama) loosely documented the true story of a tragic
            exorcism. In real-life, German-Catholic Anneliese Michel was allegedly
            possessed and began to have exorcisms in September of 1975, lasting
            until mid-1976 when she passed away. The disturbing psychological
            thriller about corresponding issues of faith and science was marked
            by many flashbacks to tell the backstory and the failed exorcism.
             19 year-old Catholic college girl Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter)
            died under the care of Catholic parish priest Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson),
            who was performing an exorcism on the demonically-possessed female.
            He was accused of negligent homicide, but pleaded not guilty. The
            Archdiocese decided to have Moore defended and represented by career-minded,
            successful agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), while the
            prosecution was headed by devout Christian Ethan Thomas (Campbell
            Scott). It was clear that Emily Rose was possessed as a college
            student alone in her room late one night at 3 am (&quot;the
            devil's hour&quot;)
            during a thunderstorm. She displayed double-jointed and contortionist
            positions and grotesque convulsions as she moaned and screamed.
            In the frightening scenes of Emily's rapidly-evolving, self-destructive,
            demonic spiritual possession, she spoke in tongues and destroyed
            religious symbols. She ate bugs, starved herself, practiced physical
            self-abuse (tore her hair out), and saw people's faces transformed
            into demonic faces. She lashed out at the parish priest who wanted
            to rid her of the &quot;dark,
            powerful forces.&quot; Medical
              experts testified in the trial for the prosecution that she probably
              suffered from both psychosis (visions) and epilepsy, while Father
              Moore expounded his continued belief in demon possession.  The
              court prosecutor claimed that Moore ignored Emily's epilepsy and
              schizophrenia, and instead concentrated on superstition, letting
              her become emaciated from dehydration and starvation when she stopped
              taking her anti-psychotic medication. Father Moore argued that
              her medications had actually impeded the success of the exorcism.
            The audio-taped exorcism was played during the court case - it was
              performed on a wet and wild Halloween night, mostly in a barn,
              buffeted by winds and her violent screams. Emily spoke in tongues
              or various languages, and ultimately revealed that there were six
              demons inhabiting her. They identified themselves as both Belial
              and Lucifer - two historical demons that had possessed Cain, Nero,
              and Judas Iscariot and one of the Legion. Emily died a few weeks
              after the exorcism. In a letter that she wrote before her death,
              she told about a vision - a visitation from the Virgin Mary, and
              chose to continue suffering (with stigmata marks on her hands)
              rather than ascending to Heaven, in order to prove that God and
              the Devil were real (&quot;People say that God is dead, but how
              can they think that if I show them the Devil?&quot;). Although
              the priest was found guilty in the case, he did not serve jail
              time. In the conclusion, Father Moore and Bruner visited Emily's
              gravesite, where her epitaph on the tombstone (chosen and placed
              there by Moore) was from the
              Bible (Philippians 2:12): &quot;Work
            out your own Salvation, with fear and trembling&quot; - words that
            Emily had spoken the night before she died. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005),</b> 90 minutes,
              D: George Clooney<br />
              Director/actor/co-writer George Clooney's B/W political docu-drama
              focused on legendary veteran radio and CBS-TV news reporter
              Edward R. Murrow (portrayed by  David Strathairn), who had engaged
              in a challenging attack in the mid-1950s against notorious, red-baiting
              US Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (Himself in archival footage) from
              Wisconsin  and his paranoia-inducing 'McCarthyism' brandished during
              hearings in the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).
              The film's title famously referred to Murrow's famous signature
              phrase - his broadcast sign-off. The film opened and closed (as
              a framing device) with Murrow's speech after accepting an award
              on October 25, 1958, to the RTNDA (Radio-Television News Directors
              Association) - a group of news professionals who were honoring
              his notable career at a gala tribute. Murrow spoke about the positive
              good and power of television to educate and inform. He first described
              &quot;what is happening to radio and television,&quot; and ended with: &quot;This
              instrument can teach, it can illuminate - and yes, it can even
              inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined
              to use it towards those ends. Otherwise, it is merely wires and
              lights in a box. Good night, and good luck.&quot; The film then
              flashbacked earlier to 1953, when Murrow was the host of the CBS-TV
              newsmagazine show '<i>See It
              Now</i>' (airing from 1951-1958), and also hosted the celebrity
              talk-show '<i>Person to Person</i>' (airing from 1953-1961). Murrow's 'See It Now' was
              momentous for criticizing the Red Scare (a Communist witch-hunt)
              perpetrated by Sen. McCarthy. His first challenge, coordinated
              with his news producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney), was to confront
              fear-mongerer McCarthy and expose the fraudulent accusations against
              discharged Air Force Officer Milo Radulovich (Himself in archival
              footage). The officer was blamed for his father's alleged ties
              to Communism, including Radulovich's refusal to denounce his family
              member. Although a controversial move (and a potential threat to
              CBS' commercial sponsors, including Alcoa), Murrow and others decided
              to courageously air the story, claiming that the officer's civil
              rights were infringed when he was dismissed without a formal hearing
              or trial. A second case heard by the HUAC involved the case of
              Pentagon employee Annie Lee Moss who also was defended after she
              denied all of the baseless and inflammatory charges. In the resultant
              backlash, McCarthy  interpreted the attack as an invitation
              to also accuse Murrow of personally being a Communist. McCarthy
              was allowed to appear on Murrow's show where he repeated his unsubstantiated
              claims and accusations that Murrow was a Communist. Murrow decisively
              refuted McCarthy and vindicated himself. It was learned that Radulovich
              was reinstated into the military, but then news also arrived that
              assailed CBS News journalist Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) had committed
              suicide. Shortly later, the US Senate became involved in an investigation
              of McCarthy, leading ultimately to his political downfall. However,
              pressures brought to bear on the CBS news organization forced 
              Chief Executive William &quot;Bill&quot; Paley (Frank Langella)
              to severely cut back on Murrow's controversial show, by shortening
              it to 30 minutes, moving it to Sunday afternoons, and limiting
              it to only five additional episodes.</font></p>        </td>

        This children/family-friendly 4th installment in the 8-film franchise-series
        of  <a href="series-harrypotter.html"><em>Harry
        Potter</em></a> films (and the first PG-13 rated), was specifically based
        on J.K. Rowling's fourth fantasy-adventure novel published in 2000. It
        was the sequel to <i><a href="series-harrypotter3.html">Harry
        Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)</a></i> and was followed by
        <a href="series-harrypotter5.html"><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the
        Phoenix (2007)</i></a>. In this series' time-frame,
        14 year-old wizardry student Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) was about
        to enter into his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
        He was suffering from nightmares about Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes)
        threatening, conspiratorial plans with his terrorist followers known
        as the Death Eaters. Harry's forehead scar with reoccurring pain was
        possibly the cause of his visions. At school, he was reunited with classmates
        Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). Headmaster
        Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) introduced a new Defence Against the
        Dark Arts teacher, the eccentric Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody
        (Brendan Gleeson). Then, during the selection of 'champion' combatants
        (17 years and older) from Hogwarts to compete against other magic schools
        in a Triwizard Tournament, Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) of Hufflepuff
        was chosen to represent Hogwarts. He would compete against rivals Viktor
        Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) of E. Europe's Durmstrang Institute and Fleur
        Delacour (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy) from France's Beauxbatons Academy
        of Magic. Inexplicably and mysteriously, the Goblet of Fire had also
        chosen Harry as a fourth competing combatant. The three tasks were difficult
        and varied: retrieving a golden egg and engaging in a gladiatorial battle
        with a dragon, a Black Lake underwater rescue, and a hedge maze-puzzle.
        In the meantime during the tournament, Harry and his close friends attended
        the Christmas-time Yule Ball - although Harry's real love interest Cho
        Chang (Katie Leung) was Cedric's date, and Ron jealously watched as Hermione
        arrived with Viktor. At the end of the final challenge, the two finishers
        Cedric and Harry reached the Triwizard Cup at the same time. The two
        were transported into Voldemort's presence in a graveyard where his Death
        Eater follower Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) (aka 'Wormtail'), who
        had betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort, murdered Cedric. Harry engaged
        in a wand 'killing' duel with the revived and resurrected form of Voldemort,
        before escaping with Cedric's corpse. In the film's conclusion, &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody
        explained to Harry that he had submitted his name to the tournament,
        and had manipulated his victory. But then, Moody - who was about to kill
        Harry - was revealed as an imposter impersonating Barty Crouch Jr. (David
        Tennant), one of Voldemort's Death Eaters. Crouch, Jr. was returned to
        the prison at Azkaban.</font></p>        </td>

              David Cronenberg<br />
              Canadian director David Cronenberg's crime-thriller and marriage
              drama told about a happily-married couple (and family of two children)
              in the small Indiana town of Millbrook. Edie Stall (Maria
              Bello) was a successful lawyer, married to Tom
              Stall (Viggo Mortensen), her mild-mannered diner manager-husband. An
              attempted robbery in the diner at closing time was foiled by
              Tom's quick-acting, self-defensive skills. With a combination of
              dazzling, ferocious and lethal  fighting-shooting skills, Tom destroyed
              two &quot;ruthless&quot; drifter
              criminals, Leland and Billie (Stephen McHattie and Greg Bryk).
              [The two criminals had bloodily massacred motel staff members in
              the opening scene.] Stabbed in the right
              foot during the assault, Tom was lauded by the community as a &quot;local
              hero&quot; and &quot;man
              of few words&quot; -
              but his past soon came back to haunt him after increased media
              attention. Irish organized crime mobster Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris)
              appeared in town in a black sedan with thugs to settle the score,
              knowing Tom as &quot;Joey Cusack&quot; - a brutal killer from Philadelphia
              that had left him scarred on his face (from barbed wire) and blind
              in his left eye. As Fogarty explained, Tom's/Joey's stalking  was
              not easily &quot;over
          and done with.&quot; Tom
              had claimed earlier in the film to his young six-year old daughter
              Sarah (Heidi Hayes) that &quot;there's no such thing as monsters,&quot; although
              he was now facing his own past 'monsters'. He had been living a
          lie for many years. During Fogarty's attempted swap of kidnapped adolescent
              son Jack (Ashton Holmes) for Tom at the farm-home, Tom dispatched
              with Fogarty's two men but was shot in the shoulder - after which
          son Jack killed Fogarty with a shotgun to protect his father. After
          painfully admitting his violent killer past to Edie as another person
          named Joey Cusack, Tom  suffered strained family relations with
          his distraught wife. He  journeyed to Philadelphia to visit his
          older brother Richie Cusack (William Hurt), the head of a city crime
          syndicate, at his Escalade estate. During a tense confrontation, Richie
          was envious that his brother Joey was &quot;living
              the American dream&quot; and claimed that disfigured Fogarty and
          others had taken their anger out on him. When
          Richie refused Joey's peace gesture (&quot;I'm
            here to make peace. Tell me what I gotta do to make things right&quot;),
            he told Joey point-blank: &quot;You could die, Joey.&quot; Richie
            had ordered his four hitmen to assassinate Joey by garrotting,
            but he swiftly killed the four thugs and then confronted his brother
          one final time before fatally shooting him in the head. The film ended
          without further dialogue in a dining room table scene involving the
          entire Stall nuclear family after Tom returned home. The two Stall
          kids understatedly welcomed their father. Sarah brought a place setting
          for her dad and Jack moved the main dish platter closer to his father.
          Edie, still feeling like she was living in a nightmare, shared a painful
          glance with Tom.</font></p>          </td>

          This bittersweet comedic drama's title &quot;Junebug&quot; referred
          to a large, scarab-shaped beetle that began flying in late spring to
          eat and reproduce. In the independent film's character-driven plot,
          newlywed Chicago art gallery dealer-owner Madeleine Johnsten (Embeth
          Davidtz) took a business trip to the South (North Carolina) with her
          husband, George Johnsten (Alessandro Nivola). She was interested
              in visiting an unknown, local &quot;outsider
              artist&quot; - an eccentric, Christian-fundamentalist, ornery and
              bigoted, anti-Semitic painter named David Wark (Frank Hoyt Taylor),
              to offer him a contract to show his art in her gallery. During
              their awkward and uneasy homecoming, they resided at George's rural,
              backwater family homestead, where the sophisticated, cultured,
              British-born, cosmopolitan and affluent Madeleine was treated as
              a distrustful 'outsider' by George's parents - a very resentful
              and judgmental Peg (Celia Weston) and soft-spoken wood-carving
              hobbyist Eugene Johnsten (Scott Wilson). The parents realized that
              their out-of-place son had escaped and married up in status and
              wealth, and was living with different values and a quality of life.
              Nonetheless, the very-worldly Madeleine became friends with George's
              almost-full term pregnant sister-in-law, Ashley (Amy Adams), the
              gregarious, star-struck, childlike and wide-eyed wife of George's
              resentful, inarticulate and frustrated younger brother Johnny (Ben
              McKenzie). Their marriage had become anxious and strained due to
              the fact that both were high school dropouts, and that Johnny was
              still living at home while working a lowly job in a kitchenware
              warehouse known as Replacements, Ltd. As time progressed, it was
              clear that Madeleine and George hadn't confronted the profound
              differences between themselves (and their upbringings) due to a
              very short courtship. While Madeleine was blithely negotiating
              a waiver-contract with the elusive artist, she coldly ignored the
              family's attentiveness to Ashley, who went into labor. Madeleine
              was devastated when George abruptly announced the tragic news that
              Ashley's infant son (who was to be named Junebug) was born &quot;blue&quot;
              (stillborn). The film's last words were delivered by a relieved
              and conflicted George to Madeleine as they drove away to return
              to Chicago at the end of their visit: &quot;I'm so f--king glad
              we're out of there.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>King Kong (2005),</b> 187 minutes, D: Peter Jackson<br />
            This newly-interpreted, monster-related epic fantasy-adventure-action
                film was the second remake of the classic film <a href="kingk.html"><i>King
                Kong (1933)</i></a>, preceded by producer Dino De Laurentiis'
                remake <i>King Kong (1976)</i> starring
                Jessica Lange, Charles Grodin and Jeff Bridges. A more recent
                reboot was <i>Kong: Skull Island (2017)</i>. In this version
                set in Depression Era 1933 (like the original), daring filmmaker
                Carl Denham (Jack Black) hired struggling and destitute vaudeville
                actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) to appear as the leading lady
                in his film project, scripted by captive
                playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) (Ann's future love interest).
                After obtaining a rare map to mysterious (and fictional) Skull
                Island, Denham and his cast and crew traveled on a tramp-steamer
                the <i>SS
                Venture</i> (originally bound for Singapore). They were sidetracked
                in the fog to the remote and uncharted island abundantly populated
                by various prehistoric creatures (giant bugs, bats, and dinosaurs)
                and threatening, cannibalistic savage black natives. Ann was
                kidnapped from the ship and presented as a ritualistic sacrificial
                offering on a large rock platform to appease &quot;Kong&quot; (Andy
                Serkis in motion capture) - an enormous, 25 foot tall ape or
                gorilla. The silverbacked, beastly Kong immediately fell in love
                with his &quot;beauty&quot; and became protective of Ann, while
                a rescue party was dispatched from the ship to locate and save
                her in the thick, impenetrable jungle. The valiant expedition
                party encountered battling dinosaurs and other primaeval creatures
                and some lost their lives, while Ann (who was rescued multiple
                times by Kong) was taken to the ape's mountainous lair. Jack
                found Ann there and was able to distract Kong with huge bats,
                before they raced back to the ship where Kong followed and was
                subdued and knocked out by Denham's chloroform. The greedy and
                exploitative Denham schemed to take Kong back to NYC, where he
                was advertised and displayed as &quot;The Eighth
                Wonder of the World.&quot; For a high admission price at Broadway's
                 Alhambra Theatre, audiences were thrilled to observe Kong shackled
                 onto a stage. When frightened and spooked by flashing cameras,
                Kong broke loose and went on a rampage in the streets to locate
                his true love Ann. Driscoll led the ape to Ann's location, where
                Kong was calmed by her presence. The two were briefly reunited
                in Central Park at a frozen pond before Kong was forced to flee
                with her for refuge to the top of the Empire State Building skyscraper.
                There in the dramatic climax, Kong defended himself from attacks
                by military planes, but eventually succumbed to his mortal wounds.
                Ann was rescued by Jack as bystanders gathered around Kong's
                corpse on the street below. Denham's classic final line ended
                the film: &quot;It wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty
                killed the Beast.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              minutes (Director's Cut), D: Ridley Scott<br />
              Director Ridley Scott's R-rated religious-historical epic war-drama,
              a 'sword-and-sandal' tale, was set during the Crusades in the Middle
              Ages of the 12th century (the year 1184 AD). The film opened by
              introducing the film's ultimate hero -- humble, hard-working French
              blacksmith Balian de Ibelin (Orlando Bloom), an ex-warrior living
              in a remote village. He had just lost his unborn child and grief-stricken
              wife (Nathalie Cox) who had committed suicide. He was approached
              by a group of Crusaders who had briefly returned home from the
              Holy Land (during a lull in the struggle between Christians and
              Muslims, occurring between the 2nd and 3rd Crusades). Among them
              was fabled knight-crusader Lord Godfrey, Baron of Ibelin (Liam
              Neeson), who claimed that he was Balian's true and long-absent
              father. Balian refused Godfrey's first request to return with him
              to Jerusalem to defend the holy city. But then, Balian learned
              that the local town Priest (Michael Sheen), his brutal and corrupt
              younger half-brother, had mercilessly ordered the beheading of
              Balian's suicidally-&quot;sinner&quot; wife before her burial.
              Enraged although normally non-violent, Balian murdered the Priest,
              and then fled the town to try to follow after and seek his father's
              aid and redemption for his act. He met up with Godfrey enroute
              to Jerusalem, explained his plight, and was trained in sword-fighting
              and the chivalric honor code. However, Godfrey was mortally wounded
              when his scheming brother and nephew, who wanted the title of Baron,
              attacked him. In the Italian city of Messina on the island of Sicily,
              Balian was knighted the new Baron of Ibelin before Godfrey passed
              away. The noble Balian journeyed onward to Jerusalem, where he
              soon became acquainted with the city's political leaders. The Christians
              were led by monarch King Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) - a silver-masked
              leper, and his second-in-command Tiberias (Jeremy Irons), Jerusalem's
              Marshall. He also met King Baldwin IV's sultry sister Princess
              Sibylla (Eva Green) who was unhappily married to her scheming,
              ruthless, power-hungry, anti-Muslim husband Guy de Lusignan (Marton
              Csokas), a Templar Knight and in line to Jerusalem's kingship.
              The traitorous Guy was allied with the cruel knight-warlord
              Raynald of Ch&acirc;tillon (Brendan Gleeson) who 
              was also interested in aggressively stirring up a destructive war
              against the Saracen King Saladin (Ghassan Massoud), the Muslim
              potentate. During this time, Balian entered into a secret affair
              with Sibylla, when he was also tempted by King Baldwin IV to take
              control of the city's army and curtail Guy and the Templars' plans
              to instigate conflict. Following the death of the King and Sibylla's
              murder (by a mercy-killing poisoning) of her own leprous son (from
              a previous marriage) - the next-in-line nephew, Queen Sibylla was
              forced to crown her husband Guy as the King. Immediately, he declared
              war on the Saracens and tried to eliminate Balian. Saladin's militarily-superior
              army overpowered the Crusaders in battle, took Guy captive, executed
              Raynald, and marched on Jerusalem, as Tiberias fled for Cyprus.
              The brave and heroic Balian was left behind to defend and save
              the besieged city. On the brink of destruction, Jerusalem was surrendered
              in exchange for allowing its defeated citizens to leave. Balian
              also dueled and defeated Guy in a sword fight (and dishonored him),
              but spared his life. In the film's epilogue, the now famous Balian
              had returned (with Sibylla) to France, where he resumed his work
              as a blacksmith and refused to again join the Crusades when a group
              of English knights passed through town.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: George A. Romero
          <br />
          This fourth film of <a href="series-dead.html">Romero's <i>Living Dead</i></a> franchise
          series was a post-apocalyptic horror film. The comeback film presented
          a symbolic class struggle after the dysfunctional collapse of human
          society and a feudal-like society had developed. Exploited masses
          of poverty-stricken residents in Pittsburgh, PA were forced to live
          in the empty, embattled streets and slums, where they were fed and
          provided with medical aid by the city. Although protected by mercenaries
          (armed guards) and electric fences, society on the outskirts of the
          city (with deserted suburbs and barren rural areas) had become overrun
          by undead, flesh-eating walkers, nicknamed &quot;stenches.&quot;
           In the city's protected,   zombie-free enclave (known as
           the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot;), it was bordered on three sides by
            large rivers and on the fourth side by   an area called &quot;The Throat&quot;
           - a bridge that was &quot;the only overland access,&quot;  fortified
           with an electric barricade. Meanwhile, the self-serving elite lived
           in  Fiddler's Green, a zombie-free enclave (a well-protected, 
           luxury high-rise condominium for the wealthy) and ruled over by powerful,
           greed-driven, super-capitalist Paul Kaufman (Dennis Hopper). The city's
           opportunistic feudal overlord, a ruthless despot, lived in the plush
           #1 penthouse apartment. He had sponsored the manufacture of the heavily-armored <i>Dead
           Reckoning</i> - a tank vehicle armed with machine guns, rockets and video cameras,
            and a fireworks-launching pad, to both control and distract-mesmerize
           the ghoulish zombies. The designer of the vehicle, combat unit leader
           Riley Denbo (Simon Baker), with his hot-tempered, second in command,
           Spanish-speaking Cholo DeMore (John Leguizamo), led and commanded
           dangerous forays, patrols and missions to look for and scavenge for
           ever-dwindling supplies for the residents of the city and Fiddler's
           Green, and in particular for Kaufman. In a backstory,
           double-crossing Kaufman was experiencing an internal uprising of dissension
           and unrest led by Cholo, his personal mercenary-assistant for three
           years. Cholo hijacked and commandeered <i>Dead Reckoning</i>,
           and planned to  blast Fiddler's Green with missiles. Kaufman requisitioned
           that Riley repossess the stolen $2 million dollar vehicle that he
           had designed, and capture or kill Cholo (who ended up  bitten
           and  undead). Meanwhile, the entire area went under siege by
           the marauding zombies, inspired by the more evolved and intelligent
           Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), a former gas station attendant. The undead
           demonstrated how they were smarter than originally believed. They
           could be trained to shoot guns and use weapons, and walk underwater
           to breach the city's once-secured perimeter defenses. The city's surviving
           inhabitants would be trapped by their own electric fencing. Eventually
           in the inevitable climax, the zombies effectively besieged the corrupt
           city and led a successful, inexorable attack against the fortified 
		   Fiddler's Green area. Kaufman was
           killed in a double-confrontation by both zombified Cholo and Big Daddy
           in his underground garage. In the conclusion, Riley fled the city,
           heading in <i>Dead Reckoning</i> toward Canada 
           to find land without other people or zombies.</font></p>          </td>

                de L'Empereur),</b> 80 minutes,
              D: Luc Jacquet<br />
              This real-world nature documentary about tall and heavy, flightless
              Emperor penguins living in the South Pole's Antarctica was awarded
              the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature of its year. With a marvelous
              narration provided by Morgan Freeman, it followed the annual, instinctual
              20-day journey of the penguins every autumn, from their normal
              habitat at the open ocean shore, across bleak frozen tundra to
              a solidly ice-frozen, inland breeding ground over 70 miles away.
              Breeding aged penguins (5 years and older) would walk there, marching
              in a line, to participate in ancestral courtship behaviors (during
              a fascinating dance-ritual), then mate (or procreate), and the
              female would lay a single egg. For two more months, the males were
              then entrusted with protecting and incubating each fragile egg
              by cradling it on top of their feet. Meanwhile, the females headed
              back to the sea to fatten up by eating fish. Then, as the chicks
              were about to hatch, the females returned to the inland plain nesting
              grounds to reunite with their mates, and care and feed their hatchling
              offspring. Once the females returned, the roles reversed as the
              exhausted and starved males  (without food for about 4 months)
              headed back to the ocean for food. During the remainder of the
              year, the adults would repeat the march back and forth, until the
              weather warmed, the ice melted, and the chicks were ready to join
              them in the ocean. Four years later, the grown-up chicks would

          <p><font size="2"><b>Memoirs of a Geisha (2005),</b> 144 minutes, D:
              Rob Marshall<br />
              Based on the 1997 novel by Arthur Golden, this cinematically-gorgeous,
              coming-of-age, melodramatic romance story was set in the late 1920s
              and progressed into the war years. Although well-received, the
              film was  criticized for casting Chinese actresses as Japanese
              women in three major roles. It told about a young Japanese girl
              who  became a geisha in Kyoto, Japan's
              Gion district. Living in a Japanese fishing village with her impoverished
              parents in 1929, a father (Mako) sold his two young daughters:
              9 year-old, blue-eyed Chiyo Sakamoto (Suzuka Ohgo as child, Zhang
              Ziyi as adult), and her older sister Satsu (Samantha Futerman)
               to a Kyoto geisha house (or &quot;okiya&quot;) in Kyoto's hanamachi
               (geisha district). Due to being less attractive, Satsu was separated
               from Chiyo and transferred to a brothel in the red-light district,
               while Chiyo was raised in a geisha house by Mrs. Kayoko &quot;Mother&quot; Nitta
              (Kaori Momoi), the Madame or proprietress. The main ruling geisha
              Hatsumomo (Gong Li), fearing Chiyo as a potential rival, immediately
              became envious, jealous, cruel and threatening due to Chiyo's beauty.
              During Chiyo's training to service male clientele (with song, instrumental
              music, dance, and conversation, and instruction in tea ceremonies),
              she was often blamed for wrong-doings by the malicious Hatsumomo.
              When Chiyo disobediently sought contact with her ostracized sister
              Satsu, she was demoted for her dishonor and rebelliousness by &quot;Mother&quot;
              - she lost her geisha training, was demoted to maid-servanthood,
              and went further in debt. At the same time, she
            received a letter informing her that both of her parents had died.
              With her hopes about becoming a geisha dashed, the
            12 year-old happened to be treated with kindness by a wealthy client,
            The Chairman Ken Iwamura (Ken Watanabe). She became enamoured of
            him and dedicated herself to reestablishing herself as a geisha
            worthy of his love. In a fortunate turn of events in 1935, 15 year-old
            Chiyo was reinstated and promoted to geisha-hood as an apprentice
            (&quot;maiko&quot;) by Hatsumomo's bitter rival, Mameha (Michelle
            Yeoh), who became Chiyo's mentor. Chiyo took on a new name as a geisha
            - Sayuri. To raise her notoriety and popularity, Mameha created
            a bidding war to auction off Sayuri's virginity (in a deflowering
            ceremony known as &quot;mizuage&quot;), propelling her into full
            geisha-hood. She attracted the attention of influential male bidders
            including the Chairman's business partner Toshikazu Nobu (K&#333;ji
            Yakusho), and Mameha's own wealthy patron (or &quot;danna&quot;)
            known as the Baron (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). When Sayuri attained a
            record-breaking bid for her virginity from Dr. Crab (Randall Duk
            Kim), &quot;Mother&quot;
            adopted her as her daughter - and made her heiress to inherit
            the &quot;okiya&quot;, while superceding another rival geisha named
            Pumpkin (Youki Kudoh) and also banishing Hatsumomo. Just as Sayuri
            was attaining celebrated status, events of WWII, including the latter
            part of the Sino-Japanese War (1941-1945), interrupted her ascent.
            By 1944,  most geisha houses were closed, and many geisha-girls
            became factory workers or took work in other occupations. Sayuri
            became a rural kimono-maker for a while, but then found herself
            being bid upon by two potential patrons (or &quot;dannas&quot;)
            - American Colonel Derricks (Ted Levine) and Nobu, although Sayuri
            was not interested - her heart was dedicated to a relationship with
            the Chairman. In the film's resolution, Sayuri was reunited with
            the Chairman, who told her that he had arranged for her apprenticehood
            with Mameha. Finally able to express their unrequited love for each
            other, they shared kisses.</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Munich (2005)</b>, 164 minutes, D: Steven Spielberg<br />
          Director Spielberg's lengthy docu-drama and political action-thriller
              was based on George Jonas' book <i>Vengeance</i> published in 1984.
              The film was a reenactment of the 1972  assault
              (September 5th) on  Israeli athletes in their Olympic Village
              apartment during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Eight
              masked Palestinian terrorists, in a group known as Black September,
              invaded the village and killed two Israeli athletes and abducted
              nine others. They fled to the airport where they demanded safe
              passage out of Germany and the release of Arab prisoners in Israeli
              and German prisons. In a standoff with German police and military
              forces at the airport, the remaining nine hostages were killed,
              while one  German police officer lost his life. Back in Israel,
              Prime Minister Golda Meir's (Lynn Cohen) government organized retaliation
              known as &quot;Operation Wrath of God&quot; to track down and eliminate (with
              &quot;eye for an eye&quot; justice) the Palestinians (in the PLO) responsible
              for the death of the Israeli athletes. A four man-unit of Jewish
              volunteers, led by hand-picked young and idealistic bodyguard and
              Mossad agent Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana), a member of the covert
              Israeli Intelligence Agency, was commissioned. Their objective
              was to target and assassinate, one-by-one, the terrorists responsible,
              while working with an unofficial handler Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush).
              By relying on paid informants such as Frenchman Louis (Mathieu
              Amalric), the group tracked and killed several in Europe (Rome,
              Paris, Cyprus, Athens and London) and Beirut, Lebanon by various
              means including shootings and bombings. During their militant activities,
              the assassins discussed their ambivalent feelings about the morality
              of what they were doing, and concerns over injuring innocent bystanders.
              During their dangerous task, the squad had concerns that their
              informant Louis was allied with their opposition, the PLO, or
              that they were working at cross-purposes with the US' CIA. Three
              of the four-man team of assassins: &quot;fixer&quot; 
			  or &quot;cleaner&quot; Carl (Ciar&aacute;n
              Hinds), German document forger Hans (Hanns Zischler), and explosives
              expert Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz) were killed themselves. Ultimately
              disillusioned, and suffering from a crisis of conscience, Avner
              - who was also feelings the effects of  PTSD and intense paranoia,
              left and flew to live in Brooklyn, NY to be reunited with his wife
              and young child, where Ephraim was unable to coax him to return
              to Israel and Mossad. A postscript stated that 9 of the men originally
              targeted by Mossad were assassinated. The elusive organizer of
              the Munich Massacre and the squad's prime target - Ali Hassan Salameh
        	  (Mehdi Nebbou), was eventually killed in 1979.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The New World (2005),</b> 135 minutes, D: Terrence
              Malick<br />
              Writer/director Terrence Malick's visually-stunning poetic historical
              epic and romantic costume drama - his fourth feature film, was
              enhanced with classical music (Mozart and Wagner), and
              marked by the extensive use of narrated internal monologues. In
              the evocative opening sequence, natives on land watched astonished,
              curious, and fearful as foreign vessels - three ships off the coast
              of the New World in Virginia, in the year 1607, arrived with a landing
              party.  The expedition was led by Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher
              Plummer)  with the objective of establishing
              a colony. One of the ship's idealistic, rebellious and stubborn prisoners,
               27 year-old Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), was brought to
              shore, pardoned from being hanged for mutiny, and admonished sternly
              by Captain Newport. Smith was chosen by Captain Newport to lead
              an envoy inland. When the expedition group became lost, it was
              confronted and attacked, and Smith was captured by the natives
              (&quot;the naturals&quot;). As the legend told, he was brought before local
              Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg), when the lovely and graceful
			   &quot;princess&quot; Pocahontas
              (&quot;Playful One&quot;) (Q'orianka
              Kilcher), the favored daughter of Powhatan, saved him from death
              out of curiosity and empathy. The two fell in love as he taught her English
              words. With the love of Pocahontas, Captain Smith realized his
              life's transformation. Eventually however, Capt. Smith was forced to
              leave the tribal group and return to the English settlement,
              where he was confronted by lack of leadership, in-fighting, starvation,
              crime, disease and other evils (cannibalism) in contrast to the
              natives. Smith felt like he had been awakened from his &quot;dream.&quot;
              During the winter, the &quot;Princess&quot; brought a rescue party
              with food, clothing, and supplies to the beleaguered and starving
              Jamestown fort inhabitants - where Smith had been appointed governor.
              The two  were briefly reacquainted, but Smith feared if they
              showed too much recognition, her life would be in danger. Pocahontas
              despaired and mourned  the death of Captain Smith when he abandoned
              her to ambitiously search for the Northwest Passage, and she was
              told that he had died during his journeys (a false claim). Pocahontas,
              who had, in the meantime, married loyal farmer John Rolfe (Christian
              Bale), was summoned to England to meet King James (Jonathan Pryce).
              She experienced an uncomfortable reunion scene in the garden of
              a country estate with her first love: regretful Jamestown explorer
              Captain John Smith, as they remembered their past together, and
              he admitted that he had made a mistake in leaving her. However,
              by now, she was truly in love with Rolfe. In the film's conclusion,
              she was running and playing hide-and-seek with her only child Thomas
              (Jonathan Gonitel) in a manicured English garden of the estate.
              Before she was able to return to the New World with Rolfe, Pocahontas
              acquired pneumonia and died in bed (with her weeping husband next
              to her), on the 13th of April, 1616. Rolfe and the boy set sail
              for America, and the film closed with shots of the clear streams
              and towering forests of the New World. </font></p></td>

            126 minutes, D: Niki Caro<b><br />
            </b>The film's tagline referred to an historic case regarding womens'
            rights and female empowerment: &quot;All She Wanted Was
            To Make A Living. Instead She Made History.&quot; The drama was based
            upon the 2002 book: <i>Class Action: The Story of Lois Jenson and
            the Landmark Case That Changed Sexual Harassment Law</i>. Similar
            to <i>Norma Rae (1979)</i>, this semi-fictionalized movie was inspired
            by the first major successful sexual harassment case in the US -- <i>Jenson
            v. Eveleth Taconite Company. </i>In the
            film, the lawsuit was filed in 1988 (although it was 1984 in reality),
            and various trials (condensed in the film) lasted from 1992 to 1998.
            In the film's backstory, single mom Josephine &quot;Josey&quot;
            Aimes (Charlize Theron) (based upon Lois Jenson) was being badly
            abused by her wife-beating husband. In the late 1980s with her two
            young children Karen (Elle Peterson) and troubled son Samuel
            &quot;Sammy&quot; Aimes (Thomas Curtis), she moved back to her small
            northern Minnesota hometown to live with her parents Hank (Richard
            Jenkins) and Alice Aimes (Sissy Spacek). Josey's
            dismissive, unapproving mining father Hank was angered at his seemingly-promiscuous
            daughter for bearing Sammy out of wedlock, while Alice offered unwise
            advice about reconciling with her husband. Encouraged
            by her mining trucker friend Glory Dodge (Frances McDormand) and
            Glory's husband Kyle (Sean Bean), &quot;Josey&quot; began working
            as one of only a few female iron miners at the Eveleth Mines (with
            a male/female ratio of 30:1), where her father also worked. To avoid
            conflict with her family, Josey and her kids moved in with Glory
            and her husband after she had applied for the job. At work, she was
            subjected to unwanted, degrading, and intimidating ridicule and sexual
            advances from the other miners in the hostile anti-female environment,
            especially from her shift supervisor Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Sharp
            (Jeremy Renner), her ex-HS boyfriend. Harrassments included graffiti,
            obscenities, semen left in a locker, and a Porta-john tipped and
            turned over with traumatized female worker Sherry (Michelle Monaghan)
            inside. Josey's complaints about abusive work conditions fell on
            deaf ears when she spoke to her main supervisor Arlen Pavich (Xander
            Berkeley) and to the mine owner Don Pearson (James Cada), who wished
            for Josey to resign and accused her of promiscuity. The board of
            directors refused to hear her concerns or do anything. When Bobby
            sexually assaulted Josey at work, she resigned - and sued the mining
            company for sexual harassment under a new workplace law designed
            to strengthen equal opportunity. She was represented by reluctant
            NY lawyer, Bill White (Woody Harrelson), a one-time hockey star,
            who helped her to begin filing a class-action lawsuit. He urged her
            to receive support and backing from other disgruntled female workers
            with the same complaints - but most of them were reluctant to speak
            out. To explain her side of the issue, in the film's most dramatic
            scene, Josey addressed hostile union members during a union meeting
            who were vehemently opposed to her lawsuit, and succeeded only when
            her father Hank came to her backing with an emotional speech. In
            court, the mining company was represented by female lawyer Leslie
            Conlin (Linda Emond), while Judge Halsted (John Aylward) presided.
            During the trial, the mining company attempted to accuse Josey of
            having a long history of promiscuity, focusing on her teenage past
            (seen in flashback, young &quot;Josey&quot; portrayed by Amber Heard)
            when she was raped by her high-school teacher Paul Lattavansky (Brad
            William Henke), resulting in her illegitimate pregnancy with son
            Sammy. During cross-examination by Josey's lawyer, young Bobby Slade
            (Cole Williams), a witness to the rape, claimed it was consensual
            sex, although his testimony was declared perjured. The case became
            a full-blown class-action suit  when &quot;Josey&quot; was finally
            joined by other miners (male and female), led by the rallying of
            Glory (who was suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease). In the film,
            the case was left unresolved, except for explanatory title cards.
            In fact, the judge ruled against the mining company, declaring that
            it should have prevented the misconduct. It was ordered to pay out
            compensatory damages to the plaintiffs. The company was also compelled
            to set up a sexual harrassment policy and educate its workers. [Note:
              In December 1998, the Eveleth Taconite Mine in Minnesota settled,
            and paid fifteen women a total of $3.5 million.]</font></p>        </td>

              Jane Austen's 1813 novel was the basis for this romantic drama,
              an oft-filmed book about love and values, with examples such as <i>Pride
              and Prejudice (1940), Pride and Prejudice (2003), </i>and the unusual <i> Pride
              and Prejudice and Zombies (2016)</i>,
              and a number of TV movies. In this PG-rated period drama set in
               late 18th-century England, the focus was on the Bennet family,
              led by  Hartfordshire, middle-class landed-gentry parents:
               low-key Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) and his overbearing, excitable
              and obsessed wife Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn). They had five marriageable
              age daughters: pretty, thoughtful and shy, but bland Jane (Rosamund
              Pike), stubborn, verbally-smart, charming and strong-willed Elizabeth
              (or &quot;Lizzie&quot;) (Keira Knightley), bookish Mary (Talulah
              Riley), immature Katherine or &quot;Kitty&quot; (Carey Mulligan),
              and young and wild Lydia (Jena Malone). If the girls could not
              marry into wealth and Mr. Bennet died, the small Bennet family
              estate would be inherited by the eldest male heir, Mr. Bennet's
              cousin Mr. William Collins (Tom Hollander) - a minister, and the
              family would become destitute. With the parents (especially the
              high-spirited Mrs. Bennet) interested in finding suitable matches
              for their daughters, two wealthy young bachelors happened to arrive
              in the nearby neighborhood (Netherfield) for the summer: rich Mr.
              Charles Bingley (Simon Woods) from London and his best friend,
              the dashingly-handsome Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen),
              along with Bingley's pretentious sister Caroline (Kelly Reilly).
              At a local public ball event, the Bennets brought their daughters
              to meet the newcomers. Jane and Mr. Bingley were mutually attracted
              to each other, but the outspoken Elizabeth almost instantly sparred
              with the seemingly-aloof, egocentric and snobbish Mr. Darcy. For
              the remainder of the overly-dramatic and beautifully-shot romantic
              film, the star-crossed lovers Elizabeth and Darcy separated, but
              often crossed paths and argued with each other - with stinging
              reproach. Although uninterested, Elizabeth found herself courted
              by the lower-class, shallow and pompous Mr. Collins, while she
              briefly became infatuated with handsome militia-member Lt.
              George Wickham (Rupert Friend). A turning point in Elizabeth's
              and Darcy's relationship came during a rainstorm when the two met
              in an outdoor shelter and Darcy expressed his love for her and
              proposed marriage - but they ended up bitterly confronting each
              other. Another twist came when young Lydia eloped and married Lt.
              Wickham - who was revealed to be a manipulative and unprincipled
              wastrel, who had earlier absconded with Darcy's rightful inheritance.
              In the meantime, Mr. Bingley had reconciled with and proposed to
              Jane and she accepted the offer. And then, although sternly discouraged
              by Darcy's wealthy and aristocratic aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh
              (Judi Dench) to not commune with Darcy, Elizabeth (who had gained
              a newfound positive appreciation for Darcy) spoke to him on the
              moors in the early morning, and joyfully accepted his proposal
              of marriage as the sun was rising.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Sin City (2005),</b> 126/147 minutes, D: Frank
              Miller, Robert Rodriguez (with Quentin Tarantino)<br />
Director Robert Rodriguez' violent (cannibalism, dismemberment, mutilation,
castration and more!), bloody and stylistic, noirish monochromatic (with splashes
of color) film presented a live-action representation of Frank Miller's graphic
comic-book novels. The digital
          film crime-thriller was composed of a series of three overlapping,
          cross-cut hard-boiled storylines set in dark and rain-slick Basin
          City. In the film's opening, a doomed, suicidal red dress-wearing
          dame known as Customer (Marley Shelton) stood on a terrace high above
          the cold, teeming city - to be kissed and then killed by The Man/Salesman
           (Josh Hartnett), a professional hitman. In the first tale (told in
          two parts), disgraced,
          heart-failing ex-cop John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) saved young 11 year-old
           Nancy Callahan (Makenzie Vega as youth, Jessica Alba as adult)  from
          depraved  serial-killing pedophile Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl). Junior was
           one of Basin City's protected criminals - the son of Senator Roark
          (Powers Boothe). In the second part of the story, after a deadly shoot-out
          between Hartigan and Roark, Jr., Hartigan was framed for Junior's crimes
          and jailed for 8 years. After his parole release, Hartigan relocated
          Nancy, now 19 years old, performing as an exotic stripper in Kadie's
          Bar. He realized that it was a trap - he had been released to lead
          the forces of evil to Nancy. He was then pursued by the deformed, smelly
          and disfigured Roark, Jr., now known as Yellow Bastard. Again, Hartigan
          protected Nancy from the Yellow Bastard and brutally killed him, but
          then suicidally took his own life to ensure Nancy's future safety.
In another storyline, tough
              ex-con, thuggish, Frankenstein-like street fighter Marv (Mickey
              Rourke) sought
              revenge against psycho-serial killer Kevin (Elijah Wood) for the
              Roark-instigated murder of his blonde hooker-lover Goldie (Jaime
              King). After he was set up and framed for the crime, Marv met with
              Lucille (Carla Gugino), his  lesbian parole
              officer, and told her he was in pursuit of the one responsible
              for Goldie's death. He went after silent, creepy, cannibalistic
              serial killer Kevin (Elijah Wood) - who had decapitated many other
              Basin City prostitutes. Marv tortured and dismembered Kevin, and
              then propped him up against a tree, after his arms and legs were
              sawed off and tied off with rubber tubing tourniquets. Kevin was
              then devoured by a meat-eating wolf (Kevin's own pet wolf). Afterwards,
              the exasperated Marv cut Kevin's head off with a saw - and stood
              there with the decapitated head in his left hand. Marv also killed
              Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark (Rutger Hauer), the Senator's brother
              and the one responsible for Goldie's murder. In the bleak ending,
              Marv accepted his death sentence  by execution in the electric
              chair for the murders of Kevin and Cardinal Roark (and for all
              their crimes as well). Before his death, Goldie's twin sister Wendy
              (also Jaime King) thanked Marv for avenging Goldie's death. Also,
              a third tale was about Sin City photographer Dwight McCarthy (Clive
              Owen) who angered abusive Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) - because
              he had begun dating Jackie Boy's girlfriend Shellie (Brittany Murphy).
              The prostitutes in Old Town were led by Dwight's sometime-lover
              Gail (Rosario Dawson), where Dwight followed and watched as Jackie
              Boy began threatening one of the prostitutes named Becky (Alexis
              Bledel). One of Old Town's prostitute defenders
              and protectors, silent  female
              martial arts expert Miho (Devon Aoki), battled Jackie Boy who ended
              up dead. Dwight discovered that Jackie Boy was actually Det. Lt. &quot;Iron
              Jack&quot; Rafferty,
            a Basin City police officer. If it was learned that the cop had
            been killed in Old Town, war would be waged on the prostitutes by
              the mob and Irish mercenaries. Meanwhile, the traitorous Becky
              had sold out Old Town by betraying the prostitutes to the mob after
              the killing of Jackie Boy,  for money and to ensure her
              mother's safety from the mob. Gail was kidnapped by mob enforcer
              Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) and held for ransom before an all-out
              assault. Dwight was able to intervene and free Gail and kill Manute,
              while the other prostitutes gunned down the remaining mob-mercenaries,
              as the injured Becky fled. In the short finale, 
              Becky was confronted by the hit-man Salesman in an elevator - 
              she was about to be assassinated for betraying the prostitutes.
              Each of the three main characters died, in part, for unselfish
              reasons: (1) Hartigan to protect Nancy, (2) Marv to avenge Goldie's
              murder, and to protect Wendy and other prostitutes, and (3) Becky
              to protect her mother.</font></p>          </td>

        This political thriller-drama of petroleum products intrigue was partially
            based upon<i> See
              No Evil</i>,
            a 2003 memoir by ex- operative Robert Baer (the George Clooney
            character) about his almost two decades in the CIA. The complex plot
              unfolded with parallel storylines spanning the globe from DC and
              Texas to Switzerland, Lebanon, Iran, and Spain. As in the memoirs,
              Bob Barnes (George Clooney) began to question the morality of his
              profession within the corrupt and degenerating, information-gathering
              CIA agency. The story began with a proposed natural gas drilling-rights
              deal-merger between Persian Gulf state Prince Nasir Al-Subaai (Alexander
              Siddig), heir to the Emirate, and China instead of with a US company
              Connex,  causing a rift in US relations. As a result, Connex 
			  (after firing its immigrant workers)
              decided to merge with a smaller US company known as Killen, owned
              by Texan oilman Danny Dalton (Tim Blake Nelson). In a shady deal,
              Killen had just acquired drilling rights to key petroleum fields
              in Kazakhstan. The merger would strengthen Connex-Killen's hold
              on the Middle Eastern oil. On one last assignment, CIA
              operative Bob Barnes was sent to orchestrate the assassination
              of Prince Nasir (for selling out to the Chinese, and other reasons)
              and restore US oil security and leadership in the region. In Lebanon,
              Barnes hired a mercenary named Mussawi (Mark Strong) to help kidnap
              and murder Nasir. Things went horribly awry when Barnes was double-crossed.
              He was kidnapped and then tortured (but ultimately rescued).
              Afterwards, Barnes was scapegoated and portrayed as a rogue agent.
              However, the plot against Nasir intensified, and plans were still
              in play  to eliminate him for the China deal, for his progressive
              reform policies, and for his earlier financing of Egyptians in
              an illegal anti-tank missile theft in Tehran. When Barnes learned
              of the continuing plot against Nasir, he rushed to warn his 
              convoy, but was too late and watched a US Predator missile strike,
              producing an explosion that killed Nasir and his family. In a second
              storyline involving the Killen merger, Dean Whiting (Christopher
              Plummer), the head of Washington law firm Sloan Whiting that was
              involved in the pending Killen deal, sent Washington attorney Bennett
              Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) on an intel-mission to oversee the merger
              and mollify the Dept. of Justice's concerns about bribery and anti-trust
              law violations. Whiting was pushing for the elimination of Prince
              Nasir who would disrupt the tenuous balance of power in the Middle
              East and cut off US access to oil. In another related plot, hotshot
              naive energy analyst Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) spent a weekend
              at Prince Nasir's home in Spain, when a tragic pool accident took
              the life of Woodman's young son. As a result, Prince Nasir (a progressive
              leader and reformer) granted Woodman's company oil interests worth
              $75 million, plus lucrative personal employment as economic advisor.
              Prince Nasir was usurped as heir to the emirate throne by his younger,
              status-quo supporting, corrupt brother Prince Meshal (Akbar Kurtha).
               [Note: Meshal's ascension was supported
              by US interests, who were against Prince Nasir's attempts
              to diversify and make his country less reliant on US dollars, and
              thus less dependent on oil profits.] A shorter cautionary
              subplot involved  young, unemployed Pakistani
              migrant worker Wasim (Mazhar Munir) who was laid off from Connex
              due to the proposed merger with Killen. The far-reaching effect
              of the layoff caused the desperate young man to eventually become
              allied with extremist, Islamic fundamentalist forces, and turn
              to terrorism. He was involved in a suicide attack on a Connex-Killen
              tanker, using one of the stolen missiles seized in Tehran. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Walk the Line (2005),</b> 136 minutes, D: James
        Mangold<br /> <i>Walk the Line</i>, a musical drama and biopic (with romantic elements)
         told the life story of country music legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix),
         aka The Man in Black. His life, a tale of marital infidelity and drug
         use, was based on two autobiographies written by Cash himself, in
         1975 and 1997. Told in flashback, the film opened first in 1968 during
         Cash's historic musical performance for inmates at California's Folsom
         State Prison, and then returned to two and a half decades earlier to
         survey his life. Born and raised on a cotton farm in Dyess, AK, 
         12 year-old John R. Cash (Ridge Canipe as boy) suffered a traumatic,
         guilt-inducing and troubling childhood incident when his older brother
         Jack (Lucas Till) was killed in a circular-saw accident, and young John
         was blamed by his brutish, hick sharecropper father Ray (Robert Patrick).
         In 1950, he joined the US Air Force and was stationed in Landsberg,
         W. Germany where he learned to play a guitar and began writing songs.
         In 1952, Cash was inspired by the Warner Bros. film
         <i>Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison (1951)</i> to compose his signature
         song: &quot;Folsom Prison Blues.&quot; He also
         established a romance with hometown girl Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin),
         married her and started a family in Memphis, TN, in 1955, where he struggled
         as a door-to-door salesman, while forming a gospel band. His musical
         career began to rise when he auditioned and signed a deal with Sam Phillips
         (Dallas Roberts), the owner of Sun Records in Memphis. He began touring
         as a band-group known as Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two (later known
         as the Tennessee Three), and performed alongside other rising stars,
         including Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne),  Carl
         Perkins (Johnny Holiday), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice), and Waylon Jennings
         (Shooter Jennings, his son). Touring led to drug addiction and alcohol
         abuse, and to his acquaintance with married June Carter (Reese Witherspoon),
         another country star. Conflict developed when he fell in love with June
         (and toured with her), while Vivian objected to his unfaithfulness.
         Although he received inspiration from a persevering June (who strongly
         criticized his drug use) and they committed adultery together, they
         split up when she soundly rejected him due to his drug use, and then
         his unhappy marriage also dissolved. After moving back to Nashville,
         TN in 1966, Cash reconciled with June, who helped him to fight his addictions
         and enter rehab programs. After recording a live-album inside Folsom
         Prison in January of 1968, June joined him for more musical band tours.
         During his live performance of June's song &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; on stage in
         Canada in February of 1968, Cash stopped and proposed to June, who finally
         accepted after 10 years, and they were married the next month.</font></p>
