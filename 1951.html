          111 minutes, D: Billy Wilder<br />
          Director/co-writer Billy Wilder's uncompromising, and harsh noirish
          commentary was a scathing attack on the sensationalizing and ruthless
          tabloid mass media. It was the 50's version of
          the 70's <i><a href="netw.html">Network (1976)</a></i> and of the 80's <i>Broadcast
          News (1987)</i>. Charles 'Chuck' Tatum (Kirk Douglas) - a belligerent,
          self-obsessed, unscrupulous big-city newspaper reporter found himself
          working for the <i>Albuquerque Sun-Bulletin</i> (with its hand-embroidered
          motto &quot;Tell the Truth&quot;). He had been fired from previous jobs for alleged
          libel, cheating with the boss' wife, hot-headedness and drunkenness.
          Contemptuous of New Mexico and utterly frustrated after a year there,
          he missed New York after being stuck in New Mexico for a year: (&quot;...Too
          much outdoors. Give me those eight spindly trees in front of Rockefeller
          Center any day. That's enough outdoors for me...). To stir up excitement
          and readership and to jump-start his career, he exploitatively stage-managed
          an &quot;ace in the hole&quot; media-frenzied story - an orchestrated
          operation to rescue good-hearted Leo Minosa (Richard Benedict), the
          adult son of a trading post owner, trapped by a cave-in of rocks 250
          feet inside an ancient, haunted Indian cliff dwelling (Mountain of
          the Seven Vultures) where he was looting it of artifacts in the remote
          town of Escudero (three hour's drive from Albuquerque). He perpetuated
          his sleazy, hustling scheme with Leo's long-suffering, jaded, and unhappy <i>femme
          fatale</i> wife Lorraine (Jan Sterling) who had a five-year unfulfilled marriage to
          Leo. The opportunistic young woman first considered running off, but
          was hustled by Tatum to remain when he suggested that there would be
          monetary rewards for staying and pretending to be a grieving wife.
          She was easily persuaded by the promise of revenue from gathering throngs
          to remain with her ailing husband. Tatum also manipulated the local
          corrupt Sheriff Gus Kretzer (Ray Teal) up for re-election to help in
          his scheme. He was able to delay rescue efforts that would have taken
          only about 12-16 hours (by simply shoring up the mine and pulling Leo
          out), but instead convinced the crew to drill from above (a 6-day job).
          In the meantime, the rescue site became a frenzied tourist attraction
          - a literal circus (S &amp; M) amusement park and carnival, and a camp ground, with rising admission
          prices and everyone taking lucrative advantage of the situation. Ultimately,
          last rites were administered by a priest to pneumonia-stricken Leo
          after 6 days of being unnecessarily trapped in the cave-in. Afterwards,
          Tatum delivered a memorable speech to the crowds to go home after Leo's
          death. In the shocking conclusion, the bleeding, defeated journalist
          Tatum collapsed at the feet of his editor-in-chief Mr. Jacob Q. Boot (Porter Hall).</font></p></td>

          minutes, D: John Huston<br />
        Director John Huston's Technicolored classic romantic adventure-comedy
        and war-related film was based on the 1935 novel by C.S. Forester - it
        told about an 'odd-couple's' unlikely romance within an exotic locale
        (in German East Africa at the start of the Great War). In
        the film's opening, the main characters were introduced, first, coarse,
        gin-swilling river rat captain Charlie Allnut (Oscar-winning Humphrey
        Bogart) on a crude tramp steamer <i>The African Queen</i>,
        whose duty was to deliver supplies and mail to two British Methodist
        missionaries in German East Africa, and then   Reverend Samuel
        Sayer (Robert Morley) and his iron-willed, spinster sister Rose Sayer
        (Katharine Hepburn). They were ministering to natives in the remote village
        of Kungdu. Charlie's personality and social class were drastically contrasted
        with the lives of the Britishers - he was grubby, belligerent, gin-swilling
        and boozing, cigar-smoking, and uncouth in language, while she (and her
        brother) were prim, pious, tee-totaling, proper, sober and religiously
        fervent. With the start of the Great War (between England and Germany),
        the threat to the personal lives of the English missionaries was dramatically
        increased. The Germans arrived to destroy the village and mission, and
        the assault caused Rose's injured brother to become feverish and delirious,
        and he soon died from insanity. Charlie returned to offer Rose safe passage
        and a place to hide and escape on his boat on a trip down the Ulanga-Bora,
        while he simultaneously tried to hide the fact from the Germans that
        he had contraband cargo composed of oxygen and hydrogen cylinders and
        blasting gelatin. An adversarial relationship soon
        developed by the unlikely pairing of Charlie and Rose. He called her
        a &quot;crazy, psalm-singing, skinny old maid,&quot; and she denounced
        his alcoholism by draining his whiskey bottles into the river. She also
        used the 'silent treatment' on him to get her way. Charlie mimicked the
        look and sounds of submerged hippos and scratching baboons on shore as
        they floated along. From almost the very beginning, Rose kept announcing
                her firm intentions and crazy plan to outfit the <i>African Queen</i> with
                home-made torpedoes, in order to sabotage, attack and sink a
                German worship at the end of the river. Charlie mimicked Rose
                by responding: &quot;What
        an absurd idea!&quot;  The two experienced numerous
        roller-coaster, down-river encounters with Germans (they had to pass
        by a German fort in daylight), and then had to traverse treacherous rapids.
        As they faced various obstacles and challenges and often quarreled, the
        two also began to develop a strange love and admiration for each other.
        He spoke to her as if she was his queen:  &quot;Pinch
            me, Rosie. Here we are, going down the river like Anthony and Cleopatra
                  on that barge!&quot; After surviving against
                    impossible odds, they found themselves embracing and kissing,
                  to their surprise. Both of them also courageously struggled
                  against numerous physical hardships, including swarms of mosquitos.
                  In one sequence when the river became swampy near the mouth
                  of the river, Charlie was forced to enter the water and pull
                  the steamer through the tangle of reeds and muck. He pulled
                  blood-sucking leeches off his body and then reluctantly had
                  to return to the water. They faced the dire possibility of
                  perishing on the boat (from starvation and lack of water) mired
                  in the oppressive and swampy conditions. A stunning
                  crane shot pulled up and away from their stuck boat in the
                  river, and disclosed how close they were to the lake, being
                  patrolled at its opening by the German gunboat, the<i> Louisa. </i>A
            sudden torrential rainstorm raised the water level, and their boat
        was freed.  They sighted the <i>Louisa</i> and
        plotted to blow it up by having Charlie attach torpedoes to the front
        of the <i>African Queen</i> in order to ram the gunboat. However, another
        storm caused the sinking and capsizing of their vessel and the separation
                  of the two of them. In  the
                  melodramatic and semi-contrived finale, both of them found
                  themselves captured and about to be hanged on the deck for
                  being British spies. Foolishly but proudly, Rose bold-facedly
                  bragged about their plan to sink the <i>Louisa</i>. Their
                  execution was delayed by their request for a pre-death marriage.
                  Meanwhile, the <i>Louisa</i> was about to collide with
      their partly submerged <i>Queen</i> outfitted with their homemade
      torpedoes on its prow. After
      an explosion (their plan succeeded), the newly-married couple found themselves
      alive in the water as black smoke engulfed the <i>Louisa</i>. A  piece
      of the wreckage from their overturned and capsized boat floating in the
      water displayed the name <i>African
      Queen.</i></font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Alice in Wonderland (1951), </b>75 minutes, D: Disney
      Studio<br />
Disney's animated musical classic (based upon Lewis Carroll's 1865 tale <i>Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland</i>) told about a madcap world known as Wonderland
where young Alice ventured during a fanciful dream sequence. In the film's opening
set in England's Victorian era, young and immature Alice (voice of Kathryn Beaumont)
was resting by a flowery river bank while listening to her older sister (voice
              of Heather Angel) read a &quot;history lesson&quot; from a boring
              book. Her mind drifted to fanciful thoughts about her own private
        Wonderland world. Alice   caught a glimpse of a White
            Rabbit (voice of Bill Thompson), with a waistcoat and a large pocket
        watch, racing by and singing &quot;I'm Late.&quot; Alice and Dinah followed
        the rabbit to a hole, where she tumbled downward into a dark tunnel.
        At the bottom of the hole, Alice pursued the Rabbit through a series
        of increasingly-smaller doors into a larger room, where she encountered
        a talking Doorknob. Inside a bottle and on a sea
              of her own tears, Alice  floated and navigated
        through the Doorknob's keyhole (mouth) and brought her to  dry
        land. She watched a  Dodo Bird (voice of Bill Thompson),
              dressed like a sea captain, and other animals in a &quot;jolly
        caucus race.&quot; She also encountered the fanciful and very
        fat twin brothers Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee (voice of J. Pat O'Malley)
        who halted her chase, and danced as they recited the short narrative
        poem of &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter.&quot; She experienced many things in different
        locations - at the Rabbit's house, in a flowerbed with Talking Flowers
        in a flower-bed and other strange insects, and then she spoke to a blue
        Caterpillar (voice of Richard Haydn), smoking a hookah and singing: &quot;A-E-I-O-U
              (The Caterpillar Song)&quot; while exhaling smoke in the shapes
        of vowels. Alice's next encounter was with a grinning, mischievous
            Cheshire Cat (voice of Sterling Holloway) with purple stripes that
        faded in and out. In a garden, she came upon a fancy tea  table
              covered with steaming and tooting teapots during the celebration
              of a wacky &quot;Unbirthday&quot;
              tea party. The celebration was attended by the Mad Hatter (voice
              of Ed Wynn), a very confused March Hare (voice of Jerry Colonna),
        and a small Dormouse (voice of James MacDonald). After becoming lost
              in the dark Tulgey Wood forest, she was saved
              when directed by the Cheshire Cat on how to escape through a short-cut,
              emerging in  the high hedge maze garden of
              the Queen (and King) of Hearts, where she met a jolly group of
              Playing Cards (known as The Mellomen) painting white roses red.
              The Queen was incensed that her roses had been sloppily  painted
              red in the royal flower garden and she had three Playing Cards
              dragged away as she bellowed: &quot;Off With Their Heads!&quot; Following
              a strange game of croquet, the Queen lost her temper and blamed
              Alice - while constantly bellowing &quot;Off
              with her head!&quot; She urged Alice to be executed immediately, but
              the King suggested a trial. Witnesses were called, including her
              friends at the tea party, but she was poorly defended until the
              Cheshire Cat reappeared and disrupted the trial proceedings. The
              film ended with a  chase through the garden
              maze.  Alice ran off and returned to the Doorknob
              room, where she looked through the keyhole and saw herself sleeping
              by the riverbank. She was awakened (and saved from the mob chasing
              after her) by her sister's voice calling out: &quot;Alice, wake
              up! Please wake up, Alice!&quot;  They returned home in time for
              afternoon tea.</font></p></td>

          minutes, D: Vincente Minnelli<br />
        This great MGM 1950s screen musical and a Best Picture-winner was colorfully
        enhanced by the grace and athleticism of Gene Kelly and direction by
        Vincente Minnelli. It featured  sumptuous sets,
        charming dance sequences, George and Ira Gershwin's memorable melodies,
        and a 13-minute, avant-garde ballet choreographed by Kelly - with
        backdrops representing various impressionistic artists. Jerry
        Mulligan (Gene Kelly), a young American G.I., lingered in Paris after
        World War II to study art and painting. He wanted to live the life of
        the great painters -- in a Montmartre garret, starving for his art. One
        of Jerry's  &quot;very good friends in Paris&quot; was aspiring American
        concert pianist Adam Cook (Oscar Levant), who was also studying abroad.
        Adam used to work as an accompanist fifteen years earlier for successful
        music-hall star entertainer Henri Baurel (Georges Guetary in his only
        American film appearance). In a neighboring bistro,   Henri showed Adam
        a picture of his 19 year old girlfriend/fiancee Lise Bouvier (young French
        teen, actress/dancer Leslie Caron in her screen debut), a beautiful dancer
        who worked in a French perfume shop. He had rescued her from the Nazis
        years earlier when her father was a Resistance leader and she was orphaned.
        Henri raised her in his own home, and grew to love her after she blossomed
        into womanhood. While Jerry was having difficulty selling his paintings,
         rich, romance-minded American gallery owner and patroness Milo Roberts
        (Nina Foch) offered to support and sponsor him, and he agreed -- even
        if the bargain meant joining the benefactress' entourage of lovers. In
        a chance encounter in a Montmartre nightclub where Jerry was with Milo,
        he spotted  Lise, a young, exquisite French mademoiselle, and instantly
        fell in love. He persistently pursued her, and was able to acquire a
        date with her, although she was reluctant. Jerry shared a romantic song/dance
        with the pretty French perfume-shop clerk Lise on
        the quay next to the bank of the Seine River to &quot;Our Love
        is Here to Stay.&quot; Unfortunately, although she was attracted
        to Jerry, she was already engaged to marry her older benefactor Henri
        Baurel. The film's most extravagant number was the closing audacious
         13-minute symphonic &quot;American in
        Paris&quot; ballet with lavish, colorful and impressionistic backdrops,
        fountains and artistic settings based on the works of famous and celebrated
        French painters (Dufy, Utrillo, Renoir, Van Gogh, Rousseau, and Toulouse-Lautrec).
         Jerry pursued Lise through the continually-changing backdrop of Paris,
        as their romance experienced many ups and downs. It began with Jerry
        in front of a black and white backdrop picking up a red rose dropped
        by Lise. The next sequence was in a Madeleine flower market where Jerry
        danced with GIs and gendarmes, and also with straw-hatted hoofers. Then
        came a passionate emotional, mating dance (during a smoky night) between
        Jerry and Lise around a fountain in the Place de la Concorde followed
        by a Moulin Rouge-styled jazzy dance in a cafe. The number ended with
        everything suddenly vanishing and the crowd disappearing. Jerry found
        himself alone with his red rose in front of the black and white sketch
        backdrop in a deserted Paris - with a zoom closeup of the red rose in
        his hand. The rose dissolved into his lovelorn, romantically desolate
        face. In the concluding happy reconciliation - from a balcony, Jerry
        saw Lise giving Henri a short, grateful farewell kiss after which Henri
        gracefully released her from her engagement and stepped aside when he
        discovered that she cared for someone else. Lise ran up a long flight
        of stairs into Jerry's arms, ecstatically reunited in a loving embrace.
        The camera panned upwards to a twinkling Paris skyline, as the young
        couple found love together.</font></p>      </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>A Christmas Carol (1951) (aka Scrooge, UK),</b> 86
            minutes, D: Brian Desmond Hurst<br />
          This black and white classic from director Brian Desmond Hurst has
          been considered the most definitive and faithful film ever made about
          miserly Ebenezer Scrooge. <i>Scrooge</i> (or <i>A Christmas Carol</i>)
          was based on writer Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, <i>A Christmas Carol
          in Prose, Being a Ghost Story of Christmas</i> (aka <i>A Christmas
          Carol</i>). The mean, white-haired Ebenezer Scrooge, known for his
          trademark phrase: &quot;Bah, humbug!&quot; was authentically portrayed
          by Alastair Sim. The film opened at the London business exchange in
          the mid-1800s, where Scrooge demonstrated his obvious distaste for
          the festive season and holiday. The wealthy Scrooge wouldn't give to
          charitable causes for the poor, destitute, unfortunate and needy (&quot;l
          wish to be left alone&quot;). He also refused a Christmas dinner invitation
          from his good-natured, cheerful nephew Fred (Brian Worth). Scrooge
          begrudgingly allowed his own underpaid, humble clerk Bob Cratchit (Mervyn
          Johns) with lame son Tiny Tim (Glyn Dearman) to have Christmas day
          off for a family celebration, although he called it an
          &quot;inconvenience.&quot;  Once he returned alone to his empty mansion
          (with his door knocker reflecting the face of a ghost), suddenly, his
          door swung open to a ghost - his long-deceased former partner Jacob
          Marley (Michael Hordern) from seven years before who was dragging heavy
          chains. After Scrooge cowered and admitted his belief in the suffering
          and tormented Marley, his former partner explained his wandering and
          tortured spirit.The shackled Marley warned that Scrooge still had a
          chance of escaping the same fate, with the visits of three ghosts that
          would begin at 1 am. A procession of three ghosts or spirits appeared
          who all advised the embittered Scrooge to repent of his greedy ways,
          and redeem himself. Each of the ghosts showed Scrooge the parts of
          his life that he had forgotten or ignored, and urged him to discover
          and adopt the true spirit of Christmas: - the Ghost of Christmas Past
          (Michael J. Dolan), a white Grecian-robed, long gray-haired gentleman
          - the Spirit of Christmas Present (Francis de Wolff) and - the Spirit
          of Christmas Yet to Come (C. Konarski), a black-garbed, horrific figure.
          With the Ghost of Christmas Past, Scrooge revisited his idealistic
          youth and saw himself (George Cole) in an earlier time. He watched
          as he met with his beloved sister Fan Scrooge (Carol Marsh), but later
          was heartbroken when he saw her die while giving birth to nephew Fred
          - someone Scrooge would resent, although Fan had graciously asked him
          to care for her orphaned boy. The segment entered a party at the Fezziwig
          household, where the younger Scrooge proposed to his fiancee Alice
          (Rona Anderson), but soon, their future marriage was not meant to be
          due to drastic changes in Scrooge's personality. Scrooge was apprenticed
          to a benevolent employer Mr. Fezziwig (Roddy Hughes), but he was lured
          (and corrupted) by a rival - mentor Mr. Jorkin (Jack Warner) to leave
          his employment. As Scrooge prospered, he manifested the first signs
          of tyrannical greed after Fezziwig was subsequently run out of business,
          and a new company emerged - the Amalgamated Mercantile Society. Alice
          returned her engagement ring to Scrooge, telling him that his pursuit
          of wealth and world-view had completely changed him. When the company
          faced scandal (Jorkin was accused of both bankruptcy and embezzlement),
          Ebenezer and his long-time colleague - accountant/clerk, John Marley
          (Patrick MacNee), who were &quot;not facing prosecution for the capital
          offense,&quot; offered to take over 51% of the company's shares (majority
          control), and in return, save the company by keeping the scandal quiet.
          Later, Scrooge offered no pity when notified that his co-partner Marley
          was dying. He remained at work until 7 pm and only then, after-hours
          on Christmas Eve, visited the dying Marley. He ignored Marley's last
          words of advice on his deathbed that Scrooge should save himself. Scrooge
          was reprimanded by the Ghost (in voice-over) for his lack of caring
          for Jacob Marley. During the second visitation by the Spirit of Christmas
          Present, Scrooge was told to observe the hearts of people with good
          will. Scrooge looked in on the happy Christmas celebrations of lowly
          miners, then his nephew Fred and the Cratchits.
          He saw that his spurned ex-fiancee Alice was now a nurse charitably
          caring for the sick and poor. The Ghost of Christmas Present also presented
          Scrooge with a grim view of a young boy and girl at his feet, representing
          Ignorance and Want in the world: (&quot;They cling to me for protection
          from their fetters. This boy is lgnorance. This girl is Want&quot;).
          During the final visitation by the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come
          (or the Future), Scrooge was most fearful of this last dark-shrouded
          spectre (looking like the Grim Reaper). He was shown that at the Cratchit
          house, Tiny Tim had died and was deeply mourned and lamented, especially
          by his father Bob Cratchit. By contrast, Scrooge watched three poor
          characters pawning off some of Scrooge's possessions the day after
          his death  with dealer Old Joe (Miles Malleson): an undertaker (Ernest
          Thesiger), a laundress (Louise Hampton), and a char lady - his maid
          Mrs. Dilber (Kathleen
            Harrison). Scrooge was aghast as he saw his things pawned off and
          sold after his own death. He also attended his own funeral, where he
          heard wealthy businessmen talking about how no one would attend (unless
          lunch was served). At the cemetery, Scrooge pondered and then horrifically
          saw his own engraved tombstone in the cemetery. He pleaded with the
          Ghost: &quot;Tell
          me l'm not already dead....I'm not the man I
          was! Why show me all this if l'm beyond all hope? Oh, pity me, Spirit,
          pity me! And help me!&quot; He asked for repentance. On Christmas morning
          after awakening from his frightful dreams, Scrooge seemed crazed, giddy
          (as a drunken man) and wild-haired. He tried to reassure his screaming
          and hysterical maid Mrs. Dilber who fled from him
          down the stairs, that he was still himself: &quot;Please, Mrs. Dilber.
          I am not mad. Even if I do this!&quot; He gave her a guinea coin as
          a Christmas present, raised her pay from two to ten shillings a week,
          and gave her the day off. Feeling redeemed, Scrooge went to a window
          and sent a boy (with the promise of a shilling) to purchase a turkey
          at the local butcher's shop, to be anonymously delivered to the Cratchits'
          home. (The Cratchit family reacted in astonishment, thinking Scrooge
          had taken leave of his senses. Scrooge then called on his nephew Fred
          at his house and asked for forgiveness for refusing to dine with him
          earlier. He also asked forgiveness from Fred's wife (Olga Edwardes).
          And then he danced a lively polka with her. The next day at work, Cratchit
          arrived late and feared being fired as he meekly approached Scrooge
          in his office. However, Scrooge laughed uncontrollably as he happily
          raised Bob Cratchit's salary, and promised to help him raise his family.
          Then he added (as he mumbled and cackled to himself): &quot;I
          don't deserve to be so happy! But I can't help it. I just can't help
          it.&quot; The narrator (Peter Bull, in voice-over) concluded the film
          with laudatory comments about Scrooge, as he ran to meet up with Tiny
          Tim - now running without crutches: &quot;Scrooge was better than his
          word. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man
          as the good old city ever knew, or any other good old city, town, or
          borough, in the good old world. And to Tiny Tim, who lived and got
          well again, he became a second father...And it was always said that
          he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the
          knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us. And so, as
          Tiny Tim observed, 'God Bless Us - Everyone.'&quot; </font></p></td>

          by Bernard Herrmann. In the  film's intriguing title sequence, an extra-terrestrial
              vessel approached into the Earth's atmosphere, emphasized by the
              electronic sounds of theremin theme music; a
              flying saucer-spaceship landed on the Ellipse (People's Park) in
          Washington DC in 1951 - causing a panic and US Army troop deployment.
              A humanoid, benevolent, pacifist, interplanetary alien emissary-visitor
              named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) emerged from the space-craft. He
              walked down a ramp, held out his hand, and announced that he brought
              a message of good-will and peace. But
              when he pulled out a device or object from inside his spacesuit
              (later described as a gift to the US President), an edgy soldier
              fired his weapon, and the device was shattered in pieces and seen
              lying on the ground next to the wounded Klaatu. Suddenly, through
              the hatch of the vessel-ship emerged Klaatu's silent, killer bodyguard
              - a giant robot named (Gort). He descended the ramp from the ship
          and confronted the military force. With his ability, when threatened, to
          zap (vaporize or melt) the soldiers' weapons, tanks and giant guns,
          he deployed a lethal, disintegration, death-ray
          laser beam heat-ray behind his sliding visor, and quickly disintegrated
          them, but then was ordered to desist. The robot,
          an interstellar guardian - a member of a police force, also had the
          power to destroy worlds such as Earth, whose inhabitants were intent
        on destruction, aggression, and hostility. Afterwards,
        Klaatu was hospitalized at Walter Reed for surgery, but healed himself
          with a salve. He escaped and went into hiding posing as an Earthling
          named Mr. Carpenter while residing with a human family (single mother/WWII
          war widow Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby (Billy Gray))
          and others in a boarding house, in order to observe their lives. Klaatu
          was led on a tour of Washington DC by Bobby, including a visit to Arlington
          Cemetery (and the grave of Bobby's father, who was killed at Anzio)
          - Klaatu was amazed: (&quot;Did all those people die in wars?&quot;).
          Klaatu was impressed with the Lincoln Memorial (and its inscribed Gettysburg
          Address). Klaatu met with Bobby's recommendation for
        &quot;the smartest man in the world&quot; -- the Einstein-like scientist
        character Dr. Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), who conferred with Klaatu, and
        was told that other alien peoples threatened to completely eliminate
        Earth (after its development of atomic power) if they didn't seek peace
        and heed his message. The next day at noon, Gort demonstrated his power over the industrial complex,
        by shutting down the world's power supply for 30 minutes (hence,
        the film's title &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;). Young
        Helen Benson was menaced outside the spaceship by the shadowy approach
        of Gort. To save herself, she delivered a command of three words - &quot;Klaatu
        barada nikto&quot; given to her by Klaatu - to prevent the menacing
        Gort looming above her from killing her and destroying the planet after
        Klaatu had been shot (and killed) by troops. Afterwards, the robot
        carried Helen in his arms into the spaceship.  The film ended with
        a soft-spoken final scene, when the resurrected extra-terrestrial Klaatu
        delivered a pro-disarmament address to scientists and other top leaders
        of Earth's governments - he lectured and warned world leaders with
        a final challenge and proclamation, as robot Gort stood behind him
        near the entrance to their spaceship - before they departed in the saucer:
        (&quot;...but if you threaten to extend your violence, this Earth of yours will be
        reduced to a burned-out cinder. Your choice is simple. Join us and
        live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration.
        We shall be waiting for your answer. The decision rests with you&quot;).</font></p>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Decision Before Dawn (1951)</b>, 119 minutes, D: Anatole
          Litvak<br />
         Director Anatole Litvak's mostly-forgotten, Best Picture-nominated,
        suspenseful war film and spy-drama contained  themes of patriotic
        loyalty and treason. Shot on location, it was set at the end of WWII
         in late 1944, when the US' dubious military strategy to facilitate the
         end of the war with the Third Reich was to recruit recently-captured,
         volunteer German POWs to provide information about German military troop
        movements. In the film's opening, the Narrator (voice-over) asked:  &quot;Why
        does a spy risk his life - for what possible reasons? If the spy wins,
        he's ignored. If he loses, he's shot.&quot; US
        Colonel Devlin (Gary Merrill) was given permission by Army Command to
        recruit volunteer German POWs, to serve as traitorous espionage, double-agent
        spies, as Devlin explained: &quot;These men, I believe, if properly trained
        and used, can help save American lives.&quot; Ultimately, two possibly undependable
        German soldiers - cynical ex-con, former circus tiger trainer,
        past Panzer factory employee, and petty thief Sgt. Rudolf Barth
        (Hans Christian Blech) - code-named &quot;Tiger,&quot; and idealistic,
        peace-loving medic Corporal Karl Maurer (Oskar Werner) - code-named &quot;Happy,&quot; volunteered
        to work for the US military even though they knew the personal risks
        (Maurer: &quot;I believe fighting against them  (his own people) now is
        fighting for them&quot;) and Maurer believed his efforts could
        shorten the war. They were deployed to work with untrusting,
        sneering, German-hating radio-operator Lieut. Dick Rennick (Richard Basehart)
        after being rigorously trained in fighting techniques (shooting, parachuting,
        etc.) by coordinator Monique (Dominique Blanchar).
        The two German POWs, in a no-win situation, would be risking their own
        lives by becoming traitorous German deserters sent behind enemy lines.
        They were to convene at a safehouse in Mannheim, Germany behind enemy
        lines, following a five-day &quot;tourist mission&quot; to determine whether German
        General Jaeger, commanding the Fourth Corps along the east bank of the
        Rhine, was actually considering surrender and wholesale defection. Rennick
        was paired with &quot;Tiger&quot; (who was born and raised in Mannheim) 
		while &quot;Happy&quot; (taking the assumed name of Corp. Karl Steiner) was
        assigned the related task of locating the 11th Panzer Corps  near
        Munich, which could move in to reinforce General Jaeger's troops if he actually
        surrendered. The threesome parachuted out of the same plane into
        Germany but split up on their way to the safehouse. &quot;Happy&quot; proceeded
        by bus to Munich and train to Nuremberg to discover the location of the
        powerful German armored unit known as the Panzers, but just missed
        them. Becoming slightly nervous about being detected and targeted, &quot;Happy&quot; was
        quickly befriended on the train by chubby German soldier Heinz Scholtz
        (Wilfried Seyfert), who despicably offered to exchange confiscated
        gold jewelry from Jewish Holocaust victims for   &quot;Happy's&quot; paper
        banknotes; he then identified himself as a Waffen-SS motorcycle messenger-courier. 
		On a streetcar, &quot;Happy&quot; was
        embarrassed when recognized by Paula Schneider (Helene Thimig) who had
        worked in the past for his surgeon father in Berlin as the clinic's head
        nurse. She told him that his father was now working at the Wurzburg base
        hospital. He was also dismayed to hear that the Panzer Corps had moved
        on two days earlier to Crailsheim. At a checkpoint during questioning
        about his unstamped papers, &quot;Happy&quot; was
        saved and reacquainted with Scholtz, who whisked him away to a forbidden
        black-market inn near Crailsheim, where he met and danced with a &quot;hostess&quot; (hooker)
        and saddened, self-hating war widow named Hilde (Hildegarde Neff). Later
        in the evening in his room after she admitted that she was
        &quot;dirty, miserable and alone,&quot; he romantically rejected
        her. However, she warned him that Scholtz was suspicious of him: (&quot;All
        I know is they're after you&quot;). As time was
        diminishing in his mission, &quot;Happy&quot; was pulled aside due to
        his medic background,  to provide medical attention to
        Oberst (Colonel) von Ecker (O.E. Hasse) in his castle headquarters, who
        was ailing from a heart condition. He saved the
        ruthless commander's life when he suffered an attack, and was
        able to accidentally learn the location of the Panzer Corps (he spotted
        a detailed map on the Colonel's desk); &quot;Happy&quot;
        was rewarded by being taken to the front at Heidelberg on an open transport,
        but everyone was ordered to leave the truck and cross on foot due to
        a destroyed bridge. During the chaos of an Allied air strike, Gestapo
        SS officer Corp. Ernst Brandenbacher (Arno Assmann) (who had been
        tipped off by Scholtz) made an attempt on &quot;Happy's&quot; life
        by shooting at him: (&quot;You won't get away, Steiner. By now,
        they know all about you everywhere. We could have taken you a long
        time ago, but I hoped that you would lead me to the others. I hoped
        to get all of you&quot;); &quot;Happy&quot; shot back, killed Brandenbacher, and narrowly escaped,
        although he realized he was on a dreaded security list of deserters/spies.
        He proceeded back to the heavily-bombed city of Mannheim, and after
        a tense flight from suspicious authorities, he met up with &quot;Tiger&quot; and
        Lieut. Rennick to share his findings, but his report about the Panzers
        was unable to be communicated further due to a damaged radio. The
          group heard a presumably 'faked' report that gravely-wounded General Jaeger had
            been put under S.S. guard in a Heidelberg hospital - and therefore
            could not surrender. And German troop movements suggested that the
            US could fall into a trap. Rennick, &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot; were
            faced with a treacherous return to Armenti&egrave;res, France (by
            swimming across the icy cold Rhine River to the American-held side).
            Once they arrived at the apartment of &quot;Tiger's&quot;
            sister-in-law, &quot;Tiger&quot; announced he would not attempt
            to return to France: &quot;When it's all over, our own people will
            spit in our faces. And you? You will say thank you and fly home.&quot;
            At the river-bank, Rennick was forced to
              shoot &quot;Tiger&quot; to silence him when he attempted to get
              away.  During their panicky efforts
                to save themselves, Rennick and &quot;Happy&quot; made it across
                the river to an island, where &quot;Happy&quot; decided to bravely
                sacrifice himself and allow himself to be captured in order to
                allow Rennick to safely escape. Rennick returned with &quot;Happy's&quot; crucial
                troop information, while regretfully realizing that his compatriot
                would probably be tortured and shot as a traitor/spy. In the
                film's final frame, the Narrator (voice-over) described
                Rennick's reaction to &quot;Happy's&quot; death:  &quot;A
                man stays alive as long as he's remembered, and is killed only
                by forgetfulness. So long, Happy. Let your real name remain unknown,
                but let the memory of your sacrifice serve as a key to the meanings
        of treason. It was to me.&quot;</font></p>      </td>

            D'un Cur&eacute; de
      Campagne), </b>95/115 minutes, D: Robert Bresson<br />
      Director Robert Bresson's first substantial film (although his fourth)
      was based upon Georges Bernanos'  1936 novel of
      the same title. The challenging story, filmed in soft-focus black and white,
      was a depressing and sad tale of alienation and the struggle to keep one's
      faith in a world of pain and suffering. In the story, a naive, idealistic,
      physically-weak, and sickly young priest - the Cur&eacute; d'Ambricourt
      (Claude Laydu) in poor health (and on an ascetic diet of stale dried bread
      and cheap wine) was assigned to work in the rural village of Ambricourt - it would be his first parish. The
      film's opening showed the serious-minded Priest writing in his personal
      journal-diary, beginning with: &quot;I don't think I'm doing anything wrong
      in writing down daily, with absolute frankness, the simplest and most insignificant
      secrets of a life actually lacking any trace of mystery.&quot; He arrived
      at the job via bicycle, where he gradually began to receive cruel ridicule
      and complaints from one of the elderly parishioners, and a general lack
      of acceptance by most townsfolk of his suffering, Christ-like life. When
      he asked his superior the Cur&eacute; de
      Torcy (Andre Guibert) for support and advice, the Priest was told to not
      desire to be accepted in the community: (&quot;Besides exterminating the
      Devil, your other dream is to be loved for who you are. A true priest is
      never loved. The church doesn't care a whit whether you're loved, my son.
      Be respected, obeyed&quot;). In town was the lavish gated
              chateau-manor of the town's wealthiest and most influential citizen
              known as the Count/Le Comte (Jean Riveyre); Count
              Ferrant's bereft and troubled Countess wife (Rachel B&eacute;rendt)
              remained grief-stricken at the death of her young son, and thus
        blamed and hated God for the loss. During a confessional, it was revealed
              to the Priest by the Count's sad, manipulative, possibly-suicidal
              teen daughter Chantal (Nicole Ladmiral) that her adulterous father
              was having an affair with the governess;  the manipulative
              Chantal were bitterly angry and hateful of both her father and
              mother - for her father's affair (&quot;I no longer respect him&quot;),
              and for her unhappy mother's tacit condoning of the relationship
              (&quot;She's a fool and a coward&quot;). The Priest felt compelled to counsel
              the embittered Countess who blamed and hated God for the loss of
              her boy, and for letting her husband's adultery continue; he taunted
              her: &quot;God
              will break you,&quot; but she responded: &quot;He has broken me
              already.&quot; However, after a lengthy and serious conversation
              with the Countess, the Priest helped her to accept her
              situation, and aided her in restoring her spiritual communion with
              God - it was his one success in town. The
              Priest brought the Countess toward absolution and spirituality,
              and the Countess admitted via a letter to him he received the next
              day that she had attained
              peace: &quot;I'm
              not resigned, I'm happy. I desire nothing.&quot; Shortly later, he learned
              that the Countess was found deceased. A few
              days later, Chantal confronted the Priest, and announced she had
              forced the Governess to pack up and leave; the Count also criticized
              the Priest for meddling (&quot;You
          have been unwillingly, or at least unknowingly, the cause of a great
          misfortune...Your character and your habits are a danger to the parish&quot;).
          Chantal also charged the Priest with harshly bullying and tormenting
          her mother to her death: (&quot;She claims her mother fought you to
          the last, and that you left her upset and spiritually distraught&quot;).
          Apparently, Chantal had secretly listened to their pivotal conversation
          and misinterpreted it. However,  the Priest confusedly refused
          to defend himself by showing the Countess' letter to those questioning
          him. He even allowed Chantal to call him a &quot;drunkard&quot; and promote her
          father's wish to have him transferred away. As the tormented Priest's
          health condition deteriorated and he was vomiting blood (and at one
          point he fell face foward into the mud and couldn't move), and he descended
          further into his own spiritual doubts, he traveled by train to Lillie
          where he was diagnosed with stomach cancer by Dr. Lavigne. In 
        the film's conclusion, the Priest's expected death in the dingy apartment
        of Priest Dufrety (Bernard Hubrenne), an ex-seminary colleague
        and friend, was described in a typed letter (read in voice-over) sent by Dufrety to Torcy. The
        Priest had  succumbed alone in &quot;great anguish&quot;
        (spitting up blood and sweating profusely), while  calmly accepting
        his fate and absolution (&quot;His face grew calm. He even smiled&quot;) - with
        his last words: &quot;What does it matter? All is grace.&quot; The letter ended: &quot;I believe he died just
        then.&quot; </font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>The Lavender Hill Mob (1951, UK), </b>81 minutes,
      D: Charles Crichton<br />
       Charles Crichton's Ealing Studios' crime-caper comedy concluded with the
       unlikely pursuit of English schoolgirls to retrieve six golden miniature
       Eiffel Towers - it was one of four Ealing Studio's comedies at mid-century,
       including <i>Kind
      Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Man in the White Suit (1951), </i>and<i> The
      Ladykillers (1955).</i> It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and
      Screenplay (T.E.B. Clarke). In the opening sequence, prim, mousy and timid
      bank clerk Henry Holland (Oscar-nominated Alec Guinness) was dining
              in a fancy restaurant in Rio de Janiero next to a pipe-smoking
              British gentleman, where he met Chiquita (Audrey Hepburn in her
              screen debut, with a very short walk-on role) and gave her money
        for a birthday present.  Holland expressed pleasure
              at having had a superb year, and then he flashbacked  to his work
              in the Bank of England with 20 years of service in the transport
              and shipment of gold bullion ingots from a refinery to the bank.
      In a continuing flashback, he mused in voice-over about his poorly paid
      job - and how he might finally become rich. His  solution
      to his impoverished life was to commit the &quot;perfect&quot;
          crime, by stealing gold bullion from the shipments and melting down
          the gold bars - he met up with his potential cohort-in-crime Alfred
          Pendlebury (Stanley Holloway), an artist in his Balmoral-Lavender Hill
          boarding house. The eccentric Alfred operated a foundry that could
          convert over &pound;1 million pounds of gold into souvenir Eiffel Tower
          paperweights to be exported (smuggled) out of the country to France
          from England without detection. Pendlebury was the perfect partner,
          since he could utilize his current Eiffel Tower paperweight molds (for
          standard leaden souvenir statues), and ship the disguised golden paperweights
        (painted black) to his Paris distribution network. They recruited two
          other petty Cockney crooks to aid in the robbery scheme: Lackery Wood
          (Sidney James) and Shorty Fisher (Alfie Bass).  Holland
          and Pendlebury traveled across the English Channel to supervise the
          transport of the golden statues to a gift shop located at the top of
          the Eiffel Tower. To their horror, they realized that a souvenir shopkeeper
          at the Parisian kiosk (on the upper level of the Eiffel Tower) had
          sold six of the gold-converted Eiffel Tower statues from a crate specially-marked
          R that she wasn't supposed to open. Holland rushed to the elevator
            to watch as a group of British schoolgirls, who had accidentally
      bought six of the statues, descended in the Tower elevator. In a riotous
          sequence, Holland and Pendlebury chased after them down a dizzying, <i>Vertigo</i>-inspired,
          winding circular staircase, to try to reach the ground level before
        the elevator did. There was a zany wild goose chase sequence after
              the British schoolgirls from Paris to London, and although five
              statues were recovered and bought back, the 6th one ended up 
              at London's Hendon Police Training College in a display of police
              history. Holland grabbed the statue, instigating another  crazy
              and confused, mad-cap police pursuit in squad cars after the bullion
              robbers. Holland humorously  broadcast false directional
        radioed reports from a stolen police car. In
        the concluding surprise revelation, Holland revealed that he had escaped
        to Rio de Janeiro with the six statues worth 25,000 pounds, and enjoyed
        his new lifestyle for one year until the money ran out: (&quot;I came
        straight on to Rio de Janeiro - 'Gay spritely land of mirth and social
        ease'... Enough to keep me for one year in the style to which I was,
        ah, unaccustomed&quot;). But then as he left the restaurant in the film's
        major plot twist, his left hand was shown handcuffed during the telling
        of his entire flashbacked story to his British dining partner - a police
        officer.</font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><strong>The Man in the White Suit (1951, UK)</strong>,
      85 minutes, D: Alexander Mackendrick<br />
      Director and co-writer Alexander Mackendrick's  post-war
            Ealing Studios satirical comedy about capitalism was one of many
        similar films at the time that featured actor Alec Guinness. In 
            the plot (with elements of sci-fi) told in a flashback, oddball,
            idealistic, brilliant-minded inventor and often-fired 'mad scientist'
              chemist Sidney &quot;Sid&quot; Stratton (Alec Guinness) was employed
              as a lowly, menial worker at a Wellsborough textile factory in
        Northern England. Stratton was using the firm's research
            laboratories to obsessively and surreptitiously perform his own experiments,
              with equipment consisting of long tubes of gurgling liquids (one
              of the film's continuing auditory themes). When found to be using
              the equipment and facilities unauthorized, he resigned before being
              fired by irate mill owner Michael Corland (Michael Gough). Corland
              was engaged to marry Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), the rebellious
        daughter of a rival textile mill owner. He found a way to pose as a worker
              at Birnley Mills, a rival mill owned by wealthy Alan Birnley (Cecil
              Parker). Likewise in their laboratories with their expensive equipment
              and supplies (valued at 8,000 pounds), Stratton was experimenting
              on an invention &quot;to astound the world&quot; - a revolutionary,
              'long-chain molecule' textile product. He ran out of the lab, screaming: &quot;I've
              done it! I've done it!&quot;, but he was initially regarded as
              a &quot;lunatic&quot; until Daphne was inspired to speak to her
        father about the worthiness of his findings. Daphne announced to her
              father: &quot;He's made a new kind of cloth. It never gets dirty,
              and it lasts forever.&quot;
              At first, the free-thinking Stratton's scientific discovery and
              further exclusive research was embraced and financed by Birnley.
               However, there were strong doubts about Stratton's &quot;tomfoolery&quot; in
              the lab after multiple explosions in the building led to extensive
        damage and bills of over 20,000 pounds.  The experiments eventually led
        to success - Stratton was able to create a new fabric that could serve
        as a substitute for wool, cotton, or linen. One problem was that the
        new unbreakable textile repelled dye just as it did dirt, so a method
        to color the fabric would have to be devised. The
        film's title referred to the brilliant-white, slightly-luminous suit
        that Stratton constructed for himself with the miraculous material (including
         radioactive thorium); Daphne dubbed him: &quot;A knight in shining
        armor.&quot; She was inspired
          by Sidney's indestructible cloth fiber invention and took his side
        as a crusader for progress. At first,  textile mogul Birnley was enthusiastic
        although he also admitted the product would be disastrous and engender
        chaos and disruption; doubts were also expressed about how the revolutionary
        fabric would directly compete with textile factory owners (and the workers)
        and their businesses, who would lose everything. During a closed-door
        business meeting between Stratton and the major mill owners, they announced
              that they had decided to pay him off to monopolize his product
              and work; they reasoned that if they didn't assume full control,
        it was feared that the new textile &quot;might upset the delicate balance
        of the market,&quot;  or might be sold to a competitor that could ruin
        them. There were efforts to pressure Stratton to give up complete control
        of his product/idea by paying him a quarter of a million pounds. Stratton
        refused, and after being physically restrained, he had to fight his way
        out of the room to escape. The business group decided
        to use Stratton's attractive friend Daphne Birnley to pressure him to
        sell the &quot;world rights&quot; to his new discovery. They tried to
        persuade her to help them convince Stratton to give up his idea, and
        she bargained for a payment of 5,000 pounds to do their bidding. The
        enticing Daphne spoke to Stratton and confided that she would escape
        with him from the mill-town if he would take the owners' lucrative offer.
        Even after kissing him, he refused, and she was relieved that he didn't
        give in. She suggested helping him to publicize the entire truth about
        the story surrounding the product. In the film's astounding
            conclusion, Stratton (wearing his glowing white suit) was chased
               by a mob (of mill owners joined with striking workers, or CAPITAL
        and LABOR) that pursued him through night-time streets, to curb his invention.
        Unexpectedly, the material used to construct his suit was found to be
        unstable. The threads began to deteriorate like tissue paper and tore
         apart. Sidney realized he must surrender and he stopped fleeing - he
        was surrounded by members of the street mob (mill owner managers and
        trade union mill worker employees) as they ripped the suit from Sidney's
        body, leaving him only in his underwear, shirt and tie as they laughed
        and screamed: &quot;It
        doesn't work! It's coming to pieces! We're saved!&quot; In the film's
        final moments,  Sidney had again been fired. On the street outside Birnley
        Mills, he had an a-ha revelatory moment (&quot;I see&quot;) and realized
        how he could fix his polymer fabric, and hurriedly walked off. With a
        knowing grin, he realized  how he could improve his formulaic creation
        - he would undoubtedly begin again after discovering the flaw in his
        original textile invention.</font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Miracle in Milan (1951, It.) (aka Miracolo a Milano)</b>, 100 minutes, D:
      Vittorio De Sica<br />
      Director/producer Vittorio De Sica's brilliant, quirky, surreal comic fantasy
      won  the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. It was an uncharacteristic
      film for the director who was one of the pioneers of Italian social realism.
      The playful, light-hearted and fanciful story (introduced with the storybook's
      &quot;Once upon a time...&quot;) was a neo-realistic, feel-good fable based
      upon co-scriptwriter Cesare Zavattini's children's book <i>l
      Tot&ograve; il Buono</i>. Tender-hearted elderly spinster  Lolotta (Emma
      Gramatica) found an abandoned baby among the cabbages in her garden patch
      in post-war Milan (Italy). She adopted the baby, cared for him with love
      and shelter, and named him Tot&ograve; (Gianni
        Branduani as 11 year-old child). She was a cheerful old woman who loved
      life: &quot;What a great big place the world is.&quot; When she died and
      after her funeral (Toto was the only attendee), he was sent to an orphanage
      and remained there for many years until released. When Tot&ograve; (Francesco
        Golisano as adult) entered the world, he was optimistic, kind, innocent-minded,
        generous and open-hearted. Without belongings or a place to live, he
        settled with other dispossessed hobos/homeless people - eccentric misfits,
        vagabonds and squatters in a shantytown camp. The residents of the illegal
        camp lived in makeshift steel-corrugated boxes  and massive cement pipes
      on a vast, snow-covered barren field outside the city. Tot&ograve; enthusiastically
      and energetically engaged and supported the outcasts during their travails,
      and helped the residents in the small 
      colony or community to work together to reinforce and build stronger shelters.
      He even supervised the move-in of newly-arrived outcast individuals into
      new housing units, including a mistreated servant named Edvige (Brunella
      Bovo) who became his sweetheart. One afternoon, one
      of many fat-cat land developers in Milan - wealthy land-owner and exploitative,
          greedy capitalist Mr. Mobbi (Guglielmo Barnab&ograve;), visited
          the squatters on the land, and was intimidated
        by them. During a Maypole celebration (including
        a lottery drawing for a chicken), when a hole was dug, water was struck
        on the settlement land - creating a fountain that turned to a gusher
        of oil. Scheming squatter Rappi (Paolo Stoppa) divulged the
            sudden discovery of oil to Mobbi, and conspicuously returned to the
            homeless camp with a top hat and a fur wrap around his neck. Mobbi
            sent representatives to announce that he now owned the private property.
        The squatter camp had to be cleared and everything had to be moved out,
        including the evicted inhabitants; Mr. Mobbi enforced his orders against
        the rebellious squatters with a squadron of police with smoke bombs,
        to force them to surrender. During
        the crisis, Tot&ograve; climbed the maypole to give up with a waving
        white flag, where he was given a magic white dove by the ghostly
        'spirit' of his guardian angel and adoptive mother Lolotta. He used its
        miraculous powers to grant secret wishes that transformed the camp, pushed
        back the smoke, and caused the police assault with water hoses to be
        defeated. One of Tot&ograve;'s
        secret wishes caused two captains of the guard to break out into an aria,
        when they raised their swords to charge forward with their troops. 
		Tot&ograve; was able to prevent Mr. Mobbi's guards from
          advancing, but then the camp residents began begging him for clothing,
          shoes, food, money, physical attributes, and other material items after
          he promised them: &quot;Queue up and keep calm. I'll make you all happy,
          I swear&quot;; the statue (Alba Arnova) in the camp's courtyard also
          miraculously came to life; however, the two 'angels' that accompanied
          Lolotta objected to Toto, as a mortal human, using their magical powers
          to present people with gifts, so they retrieved the magical dove. Toto
          was able to get it back from his 'mother' - and as he fell in love
          with Edvige and kissed her - he offered her the sun by glancing at
          the horizon and causing the sun to rise; however, the two angels again
          stole back the dove. The camp was left unprotected, and was overrun
          by the police who now evicted the occupants and jailed them. Edvige
          handed Tot&ograve; a replacement ordinary dove through the bars of
          his police wagon in Piazza del Duomo, the central square outside Milan's
          Cathedral. With this dove and through the power of his faith, Toto
          offered a wish - freedom for his friends. His wish was magically granted
          - police wagons opened their doors and walls, and the squatters flew
          
             up into the air on stolen street sweepers' broomsticks; after
            circling around the Cathedral, Toto (and Edvige) - with many others
            - departed for a better heavenly place and a positive tomorrow.</font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><strong>Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (1951, UK)</strong>,
      122 minutes, D: Albert Lewin </font><br />
      <font size="2">Writer/director Albert Lewin's romantic-fantasy drama, 
      suggested by the 17th century Flying Dutchman ghost-ship legend, featured
      fantastic Technicolored cinematography by Jack Cardiff. A prologue opened
      the film: &quot;According to the legend, the Flying
      Dutchman was condemned to wander the seas eternally unless he could find
      a woman who loved him enough to die for him.&quot; In 
      the seaport town (fictitious) of Esperanza on Spain's Mediterranean coast,
      about 20 years earlier, fishermen dragged up in their nets the corpses
      of a male and female and a copy of Omar Khayy&aacute;m's book <i>Rubaiyat</i>. 
      The town's residential archaeologist Geoffrey Fielding (Harold Warrender)
      and his niece Janet (Sheila Sim) were summoned to the beach from their
      villa by a pealing bell. Land-speed race-car driver Stephen Cameron (Nigel
      Patrick) was stunned by the sight of the bodies and was comforted by Janet.
      The film's flashbacked story was narrated (in voice-over) by Geoffrey as he
      was struggling to translate a handwritten manuscript written by the legendary
      Flying Dutchman. He was distracted by a gypsy singing in the nearby tavern
      of The Two Turtles. The scene shifted back in time to the year 1930 -
            in a local  tavern,  a group of British expatriates was
            introduced, including alluring American <i>femme fatale</i> Pandora
            Reynolds (Ava Gardner) - a nightclub singer, and two of Pandora's
            admirers: alcoholic, love-sick, and suicidal Reggie Demarest (Marius
            Goring), and Stephen Cameron. With dramatic flourish in front of
            everyone, the self-destructive Reggie poisoned his own drink and
            fell dead at her feet. He had deliberately killed himself to usher
            in his &quot;exit&quot; from life. Later, Pandora claimed she was
        relieved since he had many times threatened to take his life. That same
            evening, after a thrilling, open-air, cliff-side drive on a winding
            road in Stephen's prized race-car (named Pandora), Pandora promised
            to marry him on September 3rd (a reversal of the day's date - the
            ninth day of the third month), but he first had to prove his love
            (after he told her: &quot;I would do anything&quot;) 
			by pushing his &quot;precious&quot; automobile
            from a cliff into the sea. He obeyed her (&quot;Do it, Stephen&quot;)
        and destroyed his vehicle. Geoffrey drove up to the couple and expressed
            how astounded he was by Stephen's &quot;magnificent&quot; declaration
            of love for Pandora: &quot;The measure of love is what one is willing
        to give up for it.&quot; Pandora had spotted a &quot;strange yacht&quot; anchored
        in the bay, possibly helmed by the legendary &quot;Flying Dutchman' -
        she learned from Geoffrey that &quot;the flying dutchman is allowed to
        land once in seven years to look for the woman who can redeem him (from)...his
        curse. He's doomed to wander the sea until judgment day as Captain of
        a ghost ship, unless if he can find a woman who loves him enough to die
        for it...&quot;  Pandora compared Stephen's destructive act of love to
        the love of the woman the Dutchman was looking for. When they returned
        to the beachside, the curious Pandora kept eyeing the mysterious yacht
        in the bay. Drawn to the yacht, she tossed off her clothes onto the beach
        and swam out to the boat, where she called out for someone to answer.
        On-board, she found a solitary individual - handsome yet melancholy Dutch
        sea captain Hendrik van der Zee (James Mason) painting a picture of her
        as Pandora. He seemed to have anticipated her arrival. He suggested that
        she could be his muse - &quot;an extraordinary model, who may inspire
        me to paint in the face and form of Pandora Reynolds, the secret goddess
        whom all men in their hearts desire.&quot; Pandora was retrieved by Geoffrey
        and Stephen on a boat who were then introduced to the Dutchman. He was
        invited to have dinner the next evening at Hotel Isabella with the other
        expatriates. Meanwhile, after meeting a second rival suitor, Pandora
        regretted the sacrifice she'd required of Stephen, and allowed him to
        salvage and repair his race-car. The Dutchman moved into a garden cottage
        at the hotel, and became part of the &quot;circle&quot; of friends with
        Geoffrey while falling in love with Pandora. A few months later, he helped
        Geoffrey to translate the contents of a notebook written in the 17th
        century in Old Dutch by the &quot;doomed man&quot; himself. 
		The legendary &quot;death-ship&quot; story
        in the manuscript confirmed that the Flying Dutchman tale was being acted
        out by the sea captain. In the tale expertly visualized in the film,
        a 16th-century ship captain murdered his unfaithful wife by stabbing
        her in bed. Then, he cursed and rejected God during his murder trial,
         but narrowly escaped execution by hanging when the door of his dungeon
        prison cell was mysteriously opened. Upon returning to his ship anchored
        in the bay, he experienced a
            &quot;dreadful dream&quot; that he had wrongly murdered his truly-innocent
        wife. He momentarily considered
            committing suicide, and then learned that his unending burden and
            punishment-curse was to have &quot;immortal life&quot; and eternally
            roam the open seas with a &quot;ghostly crew&quot; until he found
        a woman who would sacrifice herself for him. 
            For six months every 7 years, he was allowed to go ashore to search
        for the elusive female, so that he might learn the meaning of love. A
            love triangle developed between the many suitors for Pandora's love:
            her ex-lover - the town's heroic bullfighting matador Juanito Montalvo
            (Mario Cabr&eacute;) (the son of a gypsy mother in Esperanza) who
            lived in Madrid, her fiancee Stephen
            whom she was preparing to marry in one month, and sea-captain Hendrik.
            At the same time, Janet (who loved Stephen from afar) accused Pandora
            of genuinely not loving him, and accused her of being dishonest,
        deceptive, and treacherous. On the beach at a celebration following Stephen's
          record-breaking race,  Pandora declared her true love for
        the sea-captain after they kissed, but Hendrik refused to have her
          die for his sake. He intentionally kept his emotions remote and
          distant, and attempted to provoke her into not loving him, and she
        realized he had pushed her away. He retreated to his yacht as she prepared
        to be married to Stephen. One week before Pandora's marriage, the jealous,
            violence-prone and infatuated matador Juan forcefully proposed to
            marry Pandora instead of Stephen,
            but she refused, with hints that it wouldn't help to eliminate Stephen,
        because she also loved someone else.  In order to possess Pandora - knowing
            that her heart was set on the Dutch sea-captain, Montalvo
            approached when Hendrik entered his cabana at the hotel at midnight.
            He hurled a knife into Hendrik's back to kill him, but didn't realize
            that the curse prevented Hendrik from dying. Hendrik only told Pandora
            that someone had killed the little terrier dog she had given him,
        but she was confused. During his next day's bullfight in the Madrid arena,
            Montalvo was lethally distracted when Hendrik appeared alive in the
            stands. He was so stunned that he turned away from the bull and was
            gored. Before he died, Montalvo confessed to Pandora that he had
            received &quot;God's punishment&quot;
        for murdering his romantic rival, but she didn't fully understand. Pandora
        spoke with Geoffrey on the eve of her wedding to Stephen, expressing
        how bewildered she was that Hendrik was still alive: (&quot;He was killed
        and he came back to life&quot;). Geoffrey suggested it was because Montalvo
        was delirious before he died. To help Pandora understand the &quot;truth&quot; about
        Hendrik, he offered her the translated manuscript to read by herself,
        noting: &quot;It's his story. Yours too, in a way.&quot; As Hendrik prepared
        to sail away (the period of his six months' stay was ending), Pandora
        again decided to swim out to his ship to join him. Both realized that
        fate and destiny had brought them together again - and that she looked
        exactly like his murdered wife in the painting and in a portrait. She
        exclaimed: &quot;When I came here for the first time, we weren't strangers.&quot;
         He concurred: &quot;We were man and wife separated for centuries and meeting again.
            The moment I saw you, I knew it. You'd come back to me.&quot; She
            agreed: &quot;I think I knew it too.&quot; Pandora vowed
        her dying love for him (and that she was happy and not afraid to die),
        and they embraced and kissed, thus freeing Hendrik from his immortal
        curse and inaugurating the start of their timeless and unending love.
        The film ended with a fiercely destructive storm that sank their ship.
         The two lovers were found entwined in a net on the beach in each other's
        arms - the conclusion of the flashback and a return to the film's opening.</font></p>      </td>

          minutes, D: George Stevens<br />
       Director George Stevens' star-crossed melodramatic romance (and social
       drama) was based on Theodore Dreiser's 1925 novel &quot;An American Tragedy.&quot;
          Set in 1950, low-born, ambitious George Eastman (Montgomery Clift)
          from Chicago hitched a ride to his distant wealthy Uncle Charles Eastman's
          (Herbert Heyes) place, where he was given an assembly-line bathing-suit
          factory job. George had left his widowed mother Hannah Eastman (Anne
              Revere), a religious mission worker in Chicago. As the mostly-ungifted,
          uneducated, aimless nephew George slowly ascended the ladder of success,
          the poor boy was entranced and infatuated by the snobbish, beautiful,
          well-bred rich socialite-debutante Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor)
          - his own distant cousin - and they fell in starry-eyed love. It was
          the love of an ideal woman which had now been discovered in her. Against
          the factory's rules about fraternizing with co-workers, at the same
          time, he also dated and impregnated poor, lower-class Alice Tripp (Shelley
          Winters), after which a doctor refused to terminate her shameful and
          unwanted pregnancy (the term abortion was not used). Using coercive
          blackmail, she threatened to reveal their relationship and pregnancy
          if George didn't marry her (to make their child legitimate), and even
          mentioned committing suicide. On Labor Day weekend
          at the Vickers' lakeside home during a vacation period, Alice arrived
          to confront George, and insisted that they go to the county clerk's
          office to get married - but it was closed for the holiday. During a
          rowboat ride with Alice on Loon Lake that dark night, George contemplated,
          planned and willed (if not actually committed) the murder of his fiancee,
          by overturning the boat and letting her drown. Then, in an ironic twist
          of fate, when she stood up to comfort and console him, she accidentally
          fell in the lake when the boat capsized, and she drowned, and he was
          unable (or unwilling) to save her. George attempted to delay dealing
          with the fact of Alice's death, but was soon confronted and arrested
          by authorities. He faced murder charges and went to trial. He intended to murder Alice, but
        there were no witnesses that he actually did. There was only strong
        circumstantial evidence against him. The relentless District Attorney
        R. Frank Marlowe (Raymond Burr, TV's future <i>Perry
          Mason</i>) devastated George on the stand. He even re-enacted the rowboat death in the courtroom,
        while George failed to credibly answer questions and help to reconstruct
        the drowning. The most dramatic courtroom moment came when Marlowe struck
          the oar across the boat, implying that George had struck Alice and
          caused her to fall into the water. In the final prison/execution farewell
          scene in his death cell, condemned and doomed poor boy George was with
          Angela to say goodbye. Angela told him: &quot;...I'll
          go on loving you for as long as I live.&quot; George replied: &quot;Love
          me for the time I have left. Then, forget me.&quot; They kissed one
          last time. Angela: &quot;Goodbye, George.&quot; She half-turned away
          and then looked back: &quot;Seems like we always spend the best part
          of our time just saying goodbye.&quot;  George took to his death the
          superimposed image of dark-haired Angela kissing him. Inevitably, George
          fell from his 'place in the sun' when executed (by the electric chair).</font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Quo Vadis (1951)</b>, 171 minutes, D: Mervyn LeRoy<br />
      Director Mervyn LeRoy's and MGM's big budget epic version of Henryk Sienkiewicz's
          classic 1896 novel about Roman Emperor Nero's Christian persecution
          starred Deborah Kerr and Robert Taylor, and featured a score by Mikl&oacute;s
          R&oacute;zsa - it was MGM's most expensive film of the time period
          (with a budget of $7.6 million). There were three other versions of
          the novel, including two silent historical dramas: <i>Quo Vadis? (1913,
          It.)</i> and  <i>Quo
          Vadis? (1924, It./Germ.)</i>, and <i>Quo Vadis (2001, Poland)</i>.
          The film (with a title translated 'Where are you going?') compressed
          the historical years of 64&ndash;68 CE (combined with other fictional
          events and characters) to survey the Roman Empire's goal to destroy
          and persecute followers of the conflicting religion of Christianity.
          In the summer of 64 AD outside Rome on the Appian Way, 14th Legion
          Commander General Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor) was on his way back
          to Rome, ruled by tyrannical Nero (Peter Ustinov) after three years
          of &quot;brilliant victories&quot; on
          the battlefield. With the aid of his Uncle Gaius Petronius (Leo Genn),
          one of Nero's most trusted advisors, Marcus was rewarded for his service.
          After meeting the beautiful Lygia (Deborah Kerr), a truly devout
          young Christian woman who was the adopted daughter of  retired
          Roman General Plautius (Felix Aylmer), he was able to acquire Lygia
          as his 'property' although she strenuously objected. When she disappeared,
          Marcus went undercover to locate her and found her at a secret ritualistic
          baptism ceremony (attended by other Christians) held in cave ruins
          after dark outside the city. Although the two expressed their love
          for each other and he proposed marriage to her, he renounced her when
          she refused to choose him over her faith. Marcus departed to
            Antium, the location of one of Nero's coastal palaces, where he was
          tempted to engage in an affair with matricidal Nero's 'harlot' Empress
          - the lustful Poppaea (Patricia Laffan). The despotic, petulant, and
          unhinged tyrant Nero was contemplating the construction of a &quot;new
          Rome&quot; known as 'Neropolis' (envisioned
          in a gigantic architectural model to be built in his own image), to
              replace the current city of Rome. He sent a squadron of soldiers
          led by General Tigellinus (Ralph Truman) to set fire to the city, and
          then at Poppaea's urging, he blamed the Christian sect for setting
          the blaze. Marcus raced back to the city to rescue Lygia and her family.
          Nero began to arrest and imprison Christians, including Marcus who
          was seized and ordered to be put &quot;with his Christian friends&quot; -
          possibly for his part in the rebellion and for slighting Poppaea. Lygia
          feared that she and other followers were destined to be slaughtered
          in the Circus by lions - part of Nero's campaign against the Christians.
          Meanwhile, previous supporters of Nero were beginning to question his
          insanity and brutality. Petronius ended his life by suicidally having
          his wrist slit, while he dictated a letter to Nero complaining of the
          Emperor's desecration of the musical arts with both his lyre and dreadful
          singing. In the Circus arena before a gigantic crowd of spectators,
          Christians were being devoured by lions, viewed from the podium
          by Nero and Poppaea. In their holding cell together, Lygia confessed
          her love for Marcus (who felt that he had become a Christian), and
          asked for Apostle Peter (Finlay Currie) to officiate a marriage ceremony
          between them, before they faced death together. In the film's conclusion,
          Marcus helped to save Lygia in the arena from a charging bull, and
          led a successful rebellion against Nero, with the support of his own
          loyal soldiers. Marcus addressed the spectators, received a &quot;thumbs-up&quot;
          from everyone but Nero, condemned Nero for his brutalities, and announced
          that General Galba was marching toward Rome to replace him and &quot;rebuild
          Rome and bring back justice.&quot; Nero's bloody tyrannical reign came
          to an end - he strangled Poppaea after blaming
          her for her failed, suggested tactic of scapegoating the Christians,
          and then was aided in his own suicidal stabbing with a dagger by his
           embittered, banished slave named Acte (Rosalie Crutchley) (&quot;You've
          lived like a monster. Now die like an emperor - by your own hand&quot;).   </font></p>      </td>

          minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
        This was another of Hitchcock's great suspense thrillers - co-scripted
        by Raymond Chandler and based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith. During
        a 'chance' meeting on a train enroute from Washington DC (a cleverly-choreographed
        sequence in which the two sets of the strangers' shoes were highlighted),
        rich, psychopathic playboy Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) explained his
        macabre, morbid theory of the perfect murder - an exchange or swap of
        murders and victims - to professional champion tennis player Guy Haines
        (Farley Granger). During their conversation, Bruno learned from Guy's
        monogrammed lighter (inscribed &quot;From A to G&quot; with two criss-crossed
            tennis rackets) that Guy was hoping to
        marry US Senator Morton's (Leo G. Carroll) daughter  Anne Morton
        (Ruth Roman) after divorcing his clinging, stifling
        estranged wife Miriam (Laura Elliot). Bruno diabolically proposed
        a bizarre scheme involving motiveless crimes - he would murder Guy's
        current wife Miriam in exchange for Guy murdering Bruno's spiteful and
        disapproving wealthy father (Jonathan Hale) so that he could acquire
        an inheritance, without any trace of clues. Haines
        quickly dismissed the preposterous and eccentric idea and soon after
        disembarked from the train in the town of Metcalf, accidentally leaving
        his lighter behind (later used by Bruno to frame Guy). A further complication
        was that the promiscuous Miriam was pregnant by another man but refused
        to allow a divorce. Bruno realized he must carry through on his part
        of the bargain, and proceeded to stalk Miriam at an amusement park before
        strangling her. Bruno showed Miriam's thick-lensed eyeglasses to Guy
        as proof of the killing - with the additional threat of blackmail, and
        kept pressuring Guy to commit a corresponding murder by presenting him
        with a map of his father's bedroom, a key to the house and a gun. The
        film's few great set pieces included the amusement park stalking and
        murder of Miriam, the cocktail party scene when Bruno playfully demonstrated
        how to commit a murder (that turned violent), and the cross-cutting between
        Guy's prolonged tennis match at Forest Hills and the storm-drain, sewer
        grating scene in Metcalf (where Bruno had accidentally dropped the lighter).
        Guy was literally playing against the clock in order to stop Bruno from
        framing him and planting incriminating evidence (the lighter) against
        him on the amusement park's &quot;Magic
            Isle&quot; island - the location of Miriam's murder. The finale involved
            an out-of-control, wildly-spinning merry-go-round carousel at the
            park where Guy and Bruno struggled, concluding with Bruno being crushed
            under the debris after it crashed. Guy was finally cleared of the
            murder when Bruno's dying hand opened up, revealing Guy's lighter,
            as the Tunnel-of-Love boat-ride proprietor testified that it was
            Bruno he saw on the night of Miriam's murder.</font></p>      </td>

          minutes, D: Elia Kazan<br />
        Director Elia Kazan's  powerful, frank, and brilliant dramatic version
         of Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize-winning play was based upon Oscar
        Saul's adaptation. The story, set during the wartime emergency, was about
        two sisters. First introduced was neurotic, disturbed, alcoholic and
        sensitive southern belle Blanche DuBois (Oscar-winning Vivien Leigh)
        who arrived by train in New Orleans. She took a streetcar named &quot;Desire&quot; to
        the dwelling of her pregnant sister Stella (Oscar-winning Kim Hunter).
        It was a dingy and cramped apartment (in a run-down building) located
        in the French Quarter that afforded little privacy. There, Blanche met
        her brutish, bullying and coarse brother-in-law Stanley Kowalski (Oscar-nominated
        Marlon Brando) - a sexy, animalistic, earthy and vulgar, muscle-bound
        and beefy male, who quickly became vicious and annoyed by Blanche's aristocratic
        affectations and fake refined airs. Blanche admitted that after their
        father's death, she acquired a high school English teaching job, but
        was relieved of her employment due to indications of 'insanity' (a vague
        reference to child molestation). Stanley was incensed when he learned
        that Blanche had seemingly lost the family home at Belle Reve to foreclosure
        and creditors, and seemed to either be holding out on the inheritance
        money fortune, or had spent it all. Blanche met Stanley's best friend/buddy
        bachelor Mitch (Oscar-winning Karl Malden), who took a romantic interest
        in the flirtatious Blanche. During one night's poker game, Stanley's
        volatility exploded and he drunkenly struck Stella. Both Stella and Blanche
        fled to their friend/landlady Eunice's (Peg Hillias) upstairs apartment
        for safety. The inarticulate Stanley, wearing a torn and sweaty T-shirt
        on the street, begged for Stella to come back by bellowing and screaming
        up to his wife: &quot;Hey Stell lahhhh...,&quot; and she returned to him. The pregnant Stella 
         descended on the stairs when Stanley begged for forgiveness from her
        and they shared a close embrace - with his ear against her swollen
        body to hear their unborn child's heartbeat. Blanche connived to have
        Stella leave Stanley for good, but she was irresistibly drawn to Stanley's
        macho passion for her. Over time, Mitch became
        uncertain about Blanche's continually-anxious and uncomfortable feelings
          about her age, and her confession that she drove her first young husband
          to suicide due to their lack of sexual consummation. Blanche's history
          of promiscuity and instability slowly began to surface. Stella also
          learned from Stanley that Blanche had actually been fired from her
          teaching job for seducing a 17-year-old student. In one telling sequence,
        Blanche (who was still neurotically grieving) conversed in small talk
        with a bashful young newspaper boy (Wright King) at the apartment's door,
        and then seductively offered herself for a maternal kiss. He
          reminded her of her young husband who had committed suicide after
          she continually demeaned him, and  wanted to
          subconsciously make up for his death - she seductively
          offered herself for a maternal kiss. Although
        Blanche and Mitch often dated and had made plans to marry,
        Stanley  stripped away and ultimately revealed the secrets of Blanche's
        embarrassing, lurid past. Ultimately, Mitch broke off their engagement
        even though Blanche piteously begged for forgiveness, after he held 
        her face up to a naked light bulb. Sensing death in the air, Blanche
          exclaimed: &quot;No, not now!&quot; as a black-shrouded woman selling
          flowers moved straight toward the front door, incanting: &quot;Flores
          para los muertos&quot; (&quot;Flowers
        for the dead&quot;). While Stella was in the hospital
        delivering her baby, Stanley confronted Blanche in the apartment and
        condemned her for all of her lies and deceptions (she fantasized that
        she would be going on a cruise with an older admiring gentleman). In
        a heavily-censored or edited sequence, Stanley rough-housed with Blanche,
        and then assaultively 'raped' her (off-screen), causing the destruction
        of whatever vestiges of her shattered self still remained when she suffered
        a nervous breakdown. In the film's conclusion, arrangements
        were made for Blanche to be admitted to a mental institution. A doctor
        and matron arrived to take Blanche away to an asylum, as she calmly told
        the elderly doctor: &quot;I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.&quot; After
        Blanche's departure, Stella rebuffed Stanley and retreated to Eunice's
        place again, and vowed to never return to Stanley.</font></p>      </td>

              (1951)</a>, </b>87 minutes,
          D: Christian Nyby<br />
          Director Christian Nyby's influential and taut horror and science-fiction
          B-film hybrid thriller was based upon John W. Campbell's 1938 story <em>Who
          Goes There? </em> This alien invasion film was producer Howard Hawks'
          sole science-fiction effort. This film effectively focused on character
          interaction, with natural and rapid-fire dialogue, and appropriate
          scientific jargon. It was remade by John Carpenter as <i>The Thing
          (1982)</i>. In November of 1950, a group of isolated scientists
            led by   effete researcher Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert
              Cornthwaite) were stationed in a remote Arctic base about 2,000
              miles north of Anchorage, AK in the vicinity of the North Pole
              (Polar Expedition Six). Carrington's infamous background included
              involvement at Bikini - a reference to the nuclear test site at
              the remote atoll in the Marshall Islands beginning in 1946, that
          led to the successful development of the war-ending bombs. Carrington
          radioed a report that a strange aircraft had crashed 48 miles from
          the research base. AF military pilot Captain Patrick Hendry (Kenneth
          Tobey) (the film's hero figure) was assigned to lead a reconnaissance
          mission with a recovery or rescue team of five people from Anchorage,
          AK to the site. On the flight, Hendry was joined by Lt. Eddie Dykes
          (James Young) and Lt. Ken Erickson (aka &quot;Mac&quot; or &quot;Macpherson&quot;)
          (Robert Nichols). Ned &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott (Douglas Spencer), a
          bespectacled Anchorage, AK newspaper journalist, tagged along. At the
          base, one of the researchers was Hendry's previous girlfriend &quot;Nikki&quot; Nicholson
          (Margaret Sheridan) - a strong-willed, independent-minded female who
          was serving as Carrington's science assistant. On a scouting mission
          to the circular-shaped crash site, the group discovered that a &quot;flying
          saucer&quot; UFO weighing 20,000 lbs. was buried deep in the Arctic
          tundra. Initial efforts to detonate thermite bombs to melt the ice
          and free the craft failed, and they watched as the craft self-destructed
          with secondary charges. However, a fragment from the spacecraft nearby
          apparently contained an eight-foot alien-humanoid life form encased
          in a frozen block of ice - possibly the ship's pilot? After removing
          the frozen spaceman from the craft and bringing it back to their research
              station headquarters as a block of ice, the Thing creature (James
              Arness, later famed for the TV western <i>Gunsmoke</i>), a scary-looking
              extra-terrestrial humanoid, was kept in a cold storeroom with watch
              periods scheduled to attend to it. The Thing accidentally thawed
              and escaped when its ice-block encasement melted (due to a cast-off
              electric blanket), and it was impervious to gunshots. It proceeded
              to kill a number of the 12 sled dogs outdoors (and in the process
              lost one arm). The arm was examined and determined to be a cellular
              structure identical to vegetable matter - it was a killing, superior,
              evolved, chlorophyll-based humanoid vegetable that fed on blood.
              Although Capt. Hendry encouraged hunting the Thing with axes and
              guns, Carrington nervously demanded that they treat their visitor
              - &quot;a stranger in a strange land&quot; - with respect so that
              it could be studied (&quot;I'm sure we can communicate with it.
              We must!&quot;). In a tense sequence, three of the scientists
               were attacked and two were killed in the greenhouse by the blood-seeking,
              carnivorous creature. When Hendry ordered the team to open the
              greenhouse front door -- they were shocked that The Thing was right
              on the other side of the door - a 'jump-scare' moment - and
              Hendry managed to slam the door on the claw of its regenerated
              left arm, and barricade it inside. Hendry then ordered  
            Carrington to be quarantined in his lab and quarters, and stripped
              of his authority to prevent him from endangering any more lives.
              Meanwhile, the crazed and obsessed Carrington was conducting dangerous
              experiments with seed pods from the Thing. He had planted the seed
              pods from X's (the Thing's) severed hand into four inches of soil
              and fed with the base's supply of blood plasma. He showed off how
              the newly-sprouted &quot;super-human&quot; sapling plants were
              growing at an &quot;amazing speed.&quot; Hendry ordered the destruction
              of the plants by fire (&quot;Burn these&quot;), and the destruction
              of the creature that was captured in the greenhouse. Of course,
              Carrington refused to buckle and stop his research experiments.
              In a suspenseful and tense sequence, Crew Chief Bob's (Dewey Martin)
              Geiger counter began to pick up the monstrous creature's movements
              with clicks and flashes - and it was heading in their direction,
              after escaping from the greenhouse. When it burst into the darkened
              mess hall room and howled, it was doused by pails filled with kerosene
              and set ablaze with a Veri pistol flare gun, and it was forced
              to retreat. The Creature used another tactic - it sabotaged
              the outside control valve for the oil line that supplied heat to
              the base, causing the group to flee to  the high-voltage
              generator room for greater protection. Their next strategy was
              to kill the alien visitor with a massive jolt of electricity. By
              directing the Creature down the narrow corridor or hallway toward
              the generator room, they  lured it onto the electrically-charged
          platform and electrocuted it. Just before the Creature was disintegrated
              into a pile of ash, Carrington attempted to intelligently
            talk to the Thing - desperately pleading and espousing that they
              could be friends, but he was knocked aside and suffered a broken
              collarbone. After the elimination of the Thing, reporter Ned
          Scott radioed a final chilling
          warning/bulletin from the North Pole: &quot;...Watch the skies, everywhere!
          Keep looking, keep watching the skies!&quot;</font></p></td>
