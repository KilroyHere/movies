          <font size="2">Stanley Kubrick's lengthy dramatic period film, an adaptation
          of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1844 novel, told about the tragic
          exploits of scheming Irish rogue Redmond Barry (Ryan O&rsquo;Neal),
          who attempted to enter the 18th century aristocracy by marrying the
           rich widow - Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). It was one of the
          most visually-beautiful films ever made, and captured  the Oscar for
          Best Cinematography. The lush, opulent, romanticized views of English
          countryside landscapes often dominated the screen, carefully composed
          as artistic paintings and appearing similar to the works of English
          portrait and landscape painter Thomas Gainsborough. When the camera
          pulled back, characters were often dwarfed by the breathtaking beauty
          of the surroundings. Technical innovations in some indoor scenes involved
          using only natural lighting - the golden illumination from candles.</font></p></td>

            Director Spielberg's blockbuster giant Great White Shark tale, a
            quintessential summer  film and action/adventure/horror
            classic, was derived from the best-selling novel by Peter Benchley. It also featured
            a thrilling, memorable and rousing score by John Williams. In the
            story set in 1975, a popular Massachusetts
            seaside resort area known as Amity Island (fictional) was gearing
            up for the profitable summer tourist season beginning with the July
            4th Independence Day weekend. The new chief of police from New York,
            Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), who was fearful of the water, had been
            called upon to investigate a brutal shark attack upon attractive
            blonde Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie) in the film's gripping
            opening. In  truly frightening, scary and surprising attacks on the
            New England coast, an unseen  monstrous
            man-eater was preying on the unsuspecting inhabitants and vacationers
            alike. Brody was confronted by the eager Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray
            Hamilton) and others to keep the town open. Three
            unlikely partners teamed up on a suspenseful 'fishing trip' to hunt
            down the rogue sea creature and destroy it: Brody, young
            university-educated marine oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss),
           and crusty, grizzled old-time fisherman Sam Quint (Robert Shaw)
            resembling the obsessed Ahab in the <em>Moby

              minutes, D: John Huston<br />
            Co-writer/director John Huston's old-fashioned, rousing costume adventure
            film and morality tale (about avarice) was based on Anglo-Indian
            novelist Rudyard Kipling's 1888 short story tale, told in flashback.
            [Note: Huston had originally wanted to make the film in the 1940s,
            with Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable in the lead roles as soldiers
            of fortune, and then in the early 1960s with Marlon Brando and Richard
            Burton.] DreamWorks SKG's film version, its second feature-length animated film <i>The
            Road to El Dorado (2000)</i>, with Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline,
            was set in Central America instead of Afghanistan. Huston's film
            garnered four Academy Award nominations including: Best Adapted Screenplay
            (John Huston &amp; Gladys Hill), Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design (Edith Head), and Best
            Art Direction-Set Decoration. Shot on location in Morocco, it opened
            in the 1880s in Lahore, India where young Rudyard Kipling (Christopher
            Plummer) was working as a newspaper editor. He met two roguish former
            British soldiers-adventurers, Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine) and
            Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery), who were planning to set out from  Raj-ruled
            India to  a remote region known as Kafiristan
            in E. Afghanistan (a province now called Nuristan). Their objective
            was to acquire wealth by ruling over the area's many warring tribes
            and setting themselves up as protective kings. After studying maps,
            making a pact to not drink or womanize, and supplying themselves
            with 20 rifles and disguises, they left Kipling and began their journey.
            When they finally (with lots of good luck) reached the primitive
            area, and were aided by an ex-Gurkha soldier named Billy Fish (Saeed
            Jaffrey), they began to train the natives to conquer their rivals. While
            serving there as military officers, the pair
            happened to be mistaken for gods or kings by the members of a priestly
            cult, when an arrow from a renegade attack struck Daniel's chest,
            but he survived without injury. Rather than
            actually being immortal, the arrow struck his bandolier and failed
            to penetrate into his flesh and wound him. The
            natives also believed he was the incarnation of Alexander the Great
            due to the Masonic medallion he was wearing. But then, due to a combination
            of greed, narcissism, and pride, their streak of luck turned tragic,
            when Daniel actually believed himself to be godly. He began  to arrogantly
            assert his own divinity and invincibility, and his right to take
            their rich royal treasures from the holy city of Sikandergul. His
            assistant Peachy, on the other hand, suspected that eventually their
            fraud would be found out, and attempted to get Daniel to give up
            the delusion and leave before calamity struck.  Daniel insisted
            on taking a native wife named Roxanne (Shakira Caine, Michael's real-life
            wife in her screen debut). The marriage turned out to be a disaster,
            because Roxanne, in fear of marrying a god, bit Daniel's face and
            drew blood - thereby exposing the two as mortals. As the two fled
            the city and its outraged natives, Daniel was killed when he was
            chased onto a rope bridge, and fell to his death 
            into a deep gorge, while Peachy was caught, tortured and crucified,
            and left for dead. He eventually survived and made his way back to
            India where he met with Rudyard Kipling and told his amazing story
            (already viewed). He punctuated his horrific story with the dessicated,
            golden-crowned head of his partner Daniel. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones<br />
            The silly, chaotic, sick joke-filled and zany Monty Python troupe,
            a close modern equivalent to the Marx Brothers, first appeared in
            their late 60s BBC-TV show, <em>Monty Python's Flying Circus</em>.
            Afterwards, the group compiled a retelling of the show's sketches
            for the big screen in <em>And Now For Something Completely Different
            (1971). </em>This was their second film and first feature-length
            film - a raucous, anarchic retelling of the Middle Ages legend of
            King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his quest, that skewered medieval
            action epics, mythology, war, religion, the Arthurian legend, Camelot
            and more. The opening credits in this popular, outrageous, and original
            cult film slowly gave way to mock Swedish titles, and drifted into
            ravings about the moose and its virtues, before grinding to a halt
            with: &quot;We apologize for the fault in the subtitles. Those responsible
            have been sacked.&quot; The opening credits resumed, but still with
            odd credits added for everything from &quot;Moose Costumes&quot; to &quot;Moose
            trained to mix concrete and sign complicated insurance forms,&quot; which
            was followed by <em>another</em> apology: &quot;The directors of
            the firm hired to continue the credits after the other people had
            been sacked, wish it to be known that they have just been sacked.
            The credits have been completed in an entirely different style at
            great expense and at the last minute.&quot; Their style of humor
            was best exemplified by the comically-gruesome encounter with the
            unbelievably persistent Black Knight (John Cleese), who still insisted
            on fighting (&quot;It's just a flesh wound&quot;) after his limbs
            had been hacked off by King Arthur. Many fans can instantly recite
            many of the memorable scenes, vignettes and set-pieces, such as the &quot;Bring
            Out Your Dead&quot; scene, or the rude, taunting Frenchman, a bloodthirsty
            killer rabbit, and the tree-shaped Knights who said &quot;Ni.&quot; Over
            the years, the troupe's popularity would grow with additional Monty
            Python films, such as <em>Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979),</em> and <em>Monty
        Python's The Meaning of Life (1983)</em>.</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Robert Altman<br />
            Altman's great country-music, Bicentennial epic length drama was
            set in the capital city of Nashville. Its view of a microcosm of
            America was summed up in one of the film's lyrics: &quot;We must
            be doing something right to last 200 years.&quot; It was one of the
            great American films of the 1970s with its multi-level, original,
            tragic-comedic epic study of American culture, show-business, leadership
            and politics. Altman was cynically commenting upon the confused state
            of American society with its political emptiness and showy commercialism.
            The satirical film  commented upon religion, politics, sex, violence,
            and the materialistic culture. The business of country-western music
            co-existed with the election campaign of an unseen, independent (populist)
            party candidate. It was told as an intricate, free-form, impressionistic,
            intertwining tale, tangentially linking together twenty-four protagonists
            who arrived on the scene to be part of the Nashville showbiz crowd,
            and appeared at a pop concert and a political rally for the &quot;Replacement
            Party.&quot; Colorful characters, both performers and audience members
            in the mosaic-style film, converged in a massive traffic jam and
            were present during a violent assassination scene by the film's conclusion.
            The main characters were: Presidential hopeful Hal Philip Walker,
            frail, crooning country western sweetheart Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley),
            singing rival Connie White (Karen Black), folk-singing lecherous
            lover Tom Frank (Keith Carradine), BBC tele-journalist Opal (Geraldine
            Chaplin), a groupie from LA (Shelley Duvall), and master of ceremonies
            Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson). Altman keenly observed the differing
            agendas of the characters - companionship and/or sex, a shot at stardom
            or political advancement, and musical aspirations, to name a few.
            There were multiple means of communication to connect the characters
            (phone calls, tape recordings, radio and TV, and P.A. announcements),
            most of whom gave a public performance at some point. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Night Moves (1975),</b> 100 minutes, D: Arthur
              Penn<br />
              Arthur Penn's moody, post-Watergate neo-noirish, psychological
          detective film and mystery-thriller told about a  missing
              persons crime case in the Florida Keys. Early
          in the film, middle-aged, chess enthusiast, ex-football player and
          LA private eye Harry Moseby (Gene Hackman) discovered to his shock
              that his wife Ellen Moseby (Susan Clark) was having an affair.
              Harry was hired in LA by wasted ex-actress and sexually-liberated
              studio boss divorcee Arlene Iverson (Janet Ward) to find her daughter,
              a promiscuous 16 year-old runaway named Delilah &quot;Delly&quot; Grastner
              (Melanie Griffith in an early role at age 16 or 17) who had been
              missing for two weeks; Delly was Arlene's daughter from her first
              husband. After contact with Delly's ex-boyfriend Quentin
          (James Woods), a greasy, suspicious LA mechanic, Harry was led to speak
          with two Hollywood stunt workers: stuntman/pilot Marv
            Ellman (Anthony Costello) and director Joey Ziegler (Edward
          Binns). Harry found Delly in the Florida Keys,
            where the liberated Delly was living with her stepfather Tom Iverson
            (John Crawford) (Arlene's second estranged husband), with a charter
              boat business, and his sexy hippie mistress Paula (singer Jennifer
              Warren). Delly claimed that the only reason that the selfish Arlene
              wanted her back was to live off her trust fund of $30,000/year,
              that required them to be living together. In the intriguing pursuit
              of the case, unexpected events - including multiple deaths-murders
              and a hidden smuggling operation of valuable Mexican artwork from
              the Yucatan to the US, had completely fooled the detective. The
              decomposed remains of stunt pilot Marv Ellman were found in a crashed
              plane in the Keys - possibly due to sabotage and a motive of jealousy.
              Harry only learned later that the plane was piloted by Marv Ellman
              and held stolen smuggled goods from Mexico. Although Moseby was
              able to convince Delly to return with him to LA to live with her
              mother Arlene, soon after on the set of a movie, as a result of
              a serious (and suspicious) car accident, Delly died and stunt coordinator
              Joey Ziegler was seriously injured. It was suspected that Quentin
              had monkeyed with the car's engine. After learning that Delly's
              stepfather Tom (and Paula) were working in cahoots with pilot Marv
              Ellman to smuggle pre-Colombian art sculptures and antiquities
              in Florida, Harry returned to the Keys where four principal characters
              were found dead or were murdered in the dramatic
              climax. The entire case had completely fooled the misguided detective
              who was left wounded and in a rudderless boat aimlessly going in
              circles. </font></p></td>

                  Nest (1975)</a>,</b> 133 minutes, D: Milos Forman<br />
            The mid-70s baby-boomers' counter-culture was ripe for a film dramatizing
            rebellion and insubordination against oppressive bureaucracy, and
            an insistence upon individual rights, self-expression and freedom.
            Director Milos Forman's drama won five major Oscar awards: Best Picture,
            Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Actress
            - it tied the record with the similar lauded romantic comedy from
            Frank Capra <a href="itha.html"><i> It
            Happened One Night (1934)</i></a>. Writer Ken Kesey's
            celebrated, best-selling 1962 novel was cinematically adapted - first
            into a 1963 Broadway play (with Kirk Douglas), and then into this
            film. It presented the  compelling,
            socially-conscious portrait of mental institution patients pitted
            by the protagonist -  free-spirited, ebullient,
            rebellious convict Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), against a
            tyrannical head nurse who kept her cool disguised by a
            sinister smile. The  energetic, flamboyant, wise-guy anti-hero 
			McMurphy feigned insanity to avoid a jail sentence 
			for statuatory rape in 1963, and was incarcerated
            in the Oregon insane asylum. His crazed struggles against oppression,
            the status-quo, conformity and the manipulative, authoritarian Nurse
            Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) symbolized the rebellious 60's
            era. He served as a catalyst and invigorating inspiration for the
            subdued, troubled patients against the mental institution (&quot;the
            cuckoo's nest&quot;). At first, he complained about the rationing
            or confiscation of cigarettes and restrictive card-playing rules.
            When he protested additional arbitrary and heavy-handed rules about
            watching a game in the World Series live in television, and then
            illegally staged a fishing field trip for the ward, he was restrained
            and punished with a series of electroshock therapies. When he returned
            to the ward, he faked being a zombie, greeting them with: &quot;How
            about it? You creeps, you lunatics, mental defectives. Let's hear
            it for Bull Goose Randall back in action...&quot; The last
            straw was McMurphy's organization of a midnight Christmas party 
			or celebration (a pre-escape party with
            alcohol and prostitutes, his two girlfriends Candy (Marya Small)
            and Rose (Louisa Moritz)). After being discovered by  the staff the
            next morning, Nurse Ratched publically shamed and humiliated stuttering
            and anxious patient Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) for apparently losing
            his virginity with Candy  during the party, and the guilt-ridden
            Billy committed suicide by slitting his throat with a piece of broken
            glass. Feeling utterly hopeless and powerless, McMurphy attacked
            Nurse Ratched and attempted to strangle her. His punishment was capped
            by a zombie-producing, paralyzing lobotomy. He returned glassy-eyed,
            catatonic, totally passive, and obediently captive to the ward. He
            was taken down and paid the ultimate price for his messianic, outrageous
            non-conformity. The strong and silent Indian &quot;Chief&quot; Bromden
            (Will Sampson) that he had befriended earlier (and was feigning being
            a deaf-mute), relieved McMurphy's pitiful misery by a mercy-killing
            - smothering him with a pillow before crashing through the outer
            wall of the hospital (he threw a heavy hydrotherapy console through
            a window) and escaping from 'the cuckoo's nest.' </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Peter Weir<br />
          Peter Weir's mystical, intriguing, and bewildering mystery-drama was
          about sexual repression at a private girls' school in Australia that
          experienced an unsolved and puzzling mystery regarding a field trip.
          The film's themes were voyeurism, peeping, repressiveness, gazing,
          coming-of-age, and dream worlds. The pre-credits prologue stated: &quot;On
          Saturday 14th February 1900 a party of schoolgirls from Appleyard College
          picnicked at Hanging Rock near Mt. Macedon in the state of Victoria.
          During the afternoon several members of the party disappeared without
          trace...&quot; On St. Valentine's Day
          in the year 1900, young nubile schoolgirls in the
          Victorian-Edwardian-era in Australia were preparing for a field trip
          - an ill-fated journey. They were instructed by strict authoritarian
          headmistress Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts) (of Appleyard College,
          a finishing school) that the group would be visiting the geological
          wonders of Hanging Rock (near Woodend, Victoria) for a day's picnic
          - metaphorically, they would be entering into a primitive place of
          wild danger (similar to the passage into adult sexuality). There were
          hints of sexual, phallic danger and feminine crevices, openings and
          caves.  Once they arrived by buggy for the day, an ominous thing happened.
          The watches of both buggy-coachman driver
          Ben Hussey (Martin Vaughan) and the young mathematics teacher Miss
          Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray) stopped exactly at 12 noon. Four of the
          girls went exploring amongst the menacing outcroppings and phallic-shaped
          forbidden volcanic rock crevices, including pretty, angelic, ethereal
          and popular blonde Miranda St. Clare (Anne Lambert) (described by a
          teacher as &quot;a
          Botticelli angel&quot;), smart glasses-wearing Marion Quade (Jane Vallis),
          pretty Irma Leopold (Karen Robson), and whining, fat Edith (Christine
          Schuler)). During their time at Hanging Rock, they stripped away their
          layers of clothing before mysteriously disappearing in the foreign
          location. Lagging-behind them, Edith screamed when she witnessed something
          at the moment of the three other girls' disappearance as they walked
          behind a rock face. Only Edith returned to the rest of the group, although
          hysterical, frightened, blubbering and unable to describe what had
          transpired.  A late-night report was given to Mrs. Appleyard back at
          school, about the three missing girls and math teacher/chaperone Miss
          McCraw, by coach-driver Ben Hussey and young French teacher/chaperone
          Mme. Dianne de Poitiers (Helen Morse). The next day, a search party
          (with bloodhounds) at Hanging Rock resulted in Albert Crundall's (John
          Jarratt) discovery of an unconscious Irma. When Irma awoke, she had
          no recollection of what had happened. Meanwhile, Mrs. Appleyard was
          implicated in abusively threatening and punishing orphaned school girl
          Sara Waybourne (Margaret Nelson) and was planning to throw her out
          of the school for her indebtedness. After the disappearance of the
          girls at Hanging Rock, concerned parents began to withdraw their children
          from the school, and Mrs. Appleyard began drinking. Mrs. Appleyard
          asserted that Sara had been taken away and returned to the orphanage;
          however, the dead and bloodied body of Sara was shockingly discovered
          the next morning on the school grounds. After the discovery, Mrs. Appleyard
          (in black mourning clothes) was thought to have hurriedly packed up
          and quickly departed before she could be questioned. The final concluding
          narration described what happened to Mrs. Appleyard: (&quot;The body
          of Mrs. Arthur Appleyard, Principal of Appleyard College, was found
          at the base of Hanging Rock on Friday, the 27th of March 1900....). </font></p></td>

                  Show (1975, UK)</a>, </b>100
              minutes, D: Jim Sharman<br />
            This low-budget, campy horror rock musical from writer/director Jim
            Sharman initially bombed at the box-office, but became, perhaps,
            the most popular cult film of all time, and one of the longest-running
            films. When the film began to play at midnight showings in Greenwich
            Village in April 1976, the film was revived as a multi-media, audience
            participatory experience and exploded as a worldwide phenomenon for
            many years. The bizarre film honored (and gently spoofed) the horror
            and science fiction genres of the past (RKO Pictures' <em><a href="kingk.html">King
            Kong (1933)</a></em>, <em><a href="forbiddenplanet.html">Forbidden
            Planet (1956)</a>, <a href="wiza.html">The
            Wizard of Oz (1939)</a>,</em> the <em>Hercules</em> films, <em>The
            Day of the Triffids (1963), </em>the classic &quot;atomic age&quot; sci-fi
            horror of the '50s, such as <em>It Came From Outer Space (1953)</em>,
            and, of course, <em><a href="fran.html">Frankenstein (1931)</a></em>).
             The film featured catchy, overtly-sexual songs
            like &quot;The Time Warp,&quot; &quot;Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me,&quot; and &quot;Sweet
            Transvestite.&quot; The film was based on the
            1973 British musical stage play <em>The
            Rocky Horror Show</em> by playwright/composer Richard O'Brien (who
            also played the butler named Riff Raff), about a haunted
            house inhabited by transexual aliens. The strange
            tale followed a straightlaced, wholesome, newly-engaged couple, Brad
            Majors (Barry Bostwick in his feature film debut) and Janet Weiss
            (Susan Sarandon). After attending a friend's
            wedding in Denton, TX (or Ohio?), in November of 1974, the engaged
            couple were forced to take refuge in a spooky
            mansion/castle on a rainy night when their car had a flat tire. The
            two were met at the castle's front door
            by  tall, gaunt, slightly bald, black-clad hunchbacked butler Riff
            Raff (Richard O&rsquo;Brien) and his sister - domestic maid Magenta
            (Patricia Quinn). They were soon brought into a world of subversiveness
            by the bisexual host - the carnivorous &quot;sweet
            transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania&quot; Dr. Frank N. Furter
            (Tim Curry), a mad scientist.  Frank invited
            the engaged couple to stay the night - (&quot;Why don'tcha stay for
            the night?&quot;). They were escorted into an ascending elevator to visit 
            Frank's secret upstairs lab for the unveiling of his artificial Frankenstein-esque
            mummified creation -  a perfect man named Rocky &quot;with
            blond hair and a tan,&quot; for Frank's bisexual gratification. Frank's
            assistants, Columbia (Nell Campbell) and Magenta, looked on. Suddenly,
            a greasy-haired, black leather-clad biker Eddie (Meatloaf) (with
            a gash over his forehead) emerged on his motorcycle from a DEEP
            FREEZE cyrogenic refrigerator that had just malfunctioned. Earlier
            when  he arrived at the castle as a delivery boy, Eddie
            became Frank's lover (but was currently Columbia's boyfriend),
            and became one of Frank's experimental lab subjects. The wrathful
            Frank murdered (off-screen) Eddie with an ice-pick inside the cyrogenic
            chamber. That evening, Frank separately seduced both Janet and Brad
            in his tent. After Janet's sexual awakening (and loss of virginity),
            she found herself sexually aroused, located Rocky and seduced him.
            It was a shock to Frank, when he learned that Rocky had been initiated
            into heterosexual love and deflowered by Janet. Riff Raff announced
            the arrival of Frank's wheelchaired, rival scientist Dr. Everett
            Scott (Brad's ex-science teacher at Denton HS) at the castle. Dr.
            Scott was viewed suspiciously by Frank as a UFO investigator for
            the federal government (and he feared that maybe Brad and Janet were
            spies also). Dr. Scott claimed he was only there looking for his
            missing nephew Eddie. During a cannibalistic dinner in the grand
            dining room to celebrate Frank's birthday, Frank carved up the meat
            platter - Frank removed the tablecloth and suddenly revealed Eddie's
            decomposing corpse under the table, hacked up and framed in a glass
            coffin. Eddie's body had been mutilated for the night's meal. To
            cover up for his ghastly crime, and also in fear that his visitors-guests
            (Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott) were conspirators, the mad Frank-N-Furter
            flipped a switch on his alien technology (a Sonic Transducer) in
            the laboratory to freeze Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott, and turn them
            into nude, marble-stone statues. Frank announced that everyone should
            prepare for a floor show. On an empty stage, each of the four marble
            statues (Brad, Janet, Rocky and Columbia, but NOT Dr. Scott) had
            been bedecked by Frank in similar decadent drag garb (singing and
            dancing versions of Frank). Each of them was unfrozen, resurrected
            or reanimated, to perform in Frank's own bizarre cabaret show. The
            climactic &quot;floor show&quot; medley
            was then presented in the empty theater in front of an RKO Radio
            Picture Tower logo. Following a pool orgy, everyone was interrupted
            by Magenta (with a <i><a href="bride.html">Bride of Frankenstein</a></i> hairdo)
            and Riff Raff (with a pitchfork-shaped laser ray-gun), both wearing
            futuristic gold and silver costumes. They announced that they had
            been promoted to lead the Transylvanians, and that Frank was now
            their prisoner. Frank was eliminated with
            Riff Raff's laser-gun weapon (&quot;a laser capable of emitting a
            beam of pure anti-matter&quot;) for the crime of killing Eddie,
            as well as Columbia for attempting to save him. Rocky came to Frank's side,
            and carried Frank's lifeless corpse to the top of the RKO radio tower
            (a parody of the climax of <a href="kingk.html"><i>King Kong (1933)</i></a>),
            while blasts struck him. When the tower toppled backwards, Rocky
            plunged into the pool and died. Riff Raff and Magenta fully revealed
            themselves as aliens - incestuous siblings from outer space (from
            the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania).    The castle-mansion,
            doubling as an alien spaceship, blasted off into space as they were
            beamed back to their home planet. Brad and Janet (still in drag
            costumes) and Dr. Scott were freed, but crawling in the charred dirt
            where the castle had once been. </font></p>        </td>

                D: Pier Paolo Pasolini<br />
            This notorious and controversial film was directed by Italian poet,
            novelist, painter and film-maker Pier Paolo Pasolini, who was murdered
            before it was released. It was based on a work by the notorious Marquis
            de Sade - to depict the short-lived, lakeside republic of Salo in
            Nazi-controlled N. Italy at the close of WWII. There, four fascist
            officials in a secluded chateau near Marzabotto totally controlled,
            abused, tortured, enslaved and victimized an anonymous group of about
            30 young and attractive peasant teenagers (both male and female)
            who had been rounded up. The group of four fascist officials (with
            four similar females) subjected them to sexual and physical tortures,
            psychological humiliation and violence over a period of a few days.
            This extreme exercise of power was supposed to symbolize the evil

          <p><font size="2"><b>Shampoo (1975),</b> 109 minutes, D: Hal Ashby<br />
            Hal Ashby's adult sex comedy farce was about the sex lives of rich,
            narcissistic individuals in Beverly Hills, CA. It was set during
            a 24-hour time period on Election Day, November 4th, 1968 when Richard
            Nixon won the presidency - it was a satirical look at the social
            and sexual mores of the late 1960s, as exemplified by the main characters.
            Studly, liberated, seductive, single, 34-year-old playboyish Beverly
            Hills hair-dresser George Roundy (Warren Beatty) was often engaged
            in sexual relations with his female clients.  Randy hair-stylist
            George feared commitment and was suspected to be gay, but engaged
            in simultaneous, round-robin heterosexual affairs with three women
            (actor Beatty's role reportedly mirrored his own Tinseltown exploits):
            George's foul-mouthed old lover-girlfriend Jackie Shawn (Julie Christie)
            - now the mistress of conservative, wealthy businessman Lester (Jack
            Warden) (George's potential financier), Lester's self-centered, opportunistic
            wife Felicia Karpf (Oscar-winning Lee Grant), and George's current
            pert but dumb aspiring actress/girlfriend Jill (Goldie Hawn), an
            aspiring actress. Jill was best friends with Jackie, who had not
            told Lester about her previous relationship with George. Jill was
            also dating film director Johnny Pope (Tony Bill) who was considering
            her for a role in his next movie filming in Egypt. George's objective
            was to open his own hair salon, but he lacked a credit rating and
            financial references, and the bank refused to offer him a loan. The
            convergence of characters and issues arose when George sought to
            obtain financial bankrolling-backing from Lester. Felicia supported
            George's business venture, while implying that George (her lover
            on the side) was homosexual to avoid bringing suspicion upon herself.
            In one scene after George cut Jackie's hair in Lester's steamy bathroom,
            George proceeded to have sex with Jackie on the floor, when they
            were interrupted by Lester. To fool him, they pretended to be doing
            her hair and told him to close the door and not let the steam out.
            Lester's seductive, resentful, Lolita-esque 17-year old teenaged
            daughter Lorna (Carrie Fisher) who wanted to avenge her cheating
            mother Felicia through sex with her hairdresser, asked George a series
            of personal questions, and then offered him a very forward proposition:
          &quot;You're my mother's hairdresser...Are you gay?...Are you queer?...Have
          you ever made it with a guy?...Do you wanna f--k?&quot; After going
          to bed with Lorna, Felicia arrived home and the exhausted George was
          immediately forced to have sex with her too. In the film's central
          highpoint, Lester (who believed that George was gay) allowed him to
          escort his wife Jackie to a 1968 Nixon-Republican Party election-night
          victory dinner at The Bistro restaurant. Jackie became drunk and embarrassed
          herself by groping at George. Later in the evening, when all the main
          characters proceeded to a hip and posh counterculture party at a private
          Beverly Hills mansion with lots of booze and drugs, Lester
          and Jill (with her date) stumbled upon an unidentified couple in a
          boathouse during the party. George was in the midst of having sexual
          intercourse with Jackie in the dark. Both Jill and Lester were disgusted
          by George's behavior and stormed off. By film's end, George's world
          had fallen apart when all his various secretive liaisons were revealed,
          when he was shown to be incapable of love, and he deserved to be abandoned.
          The final sequence was of morally-shallow, bleak miserable and hedonistic
          George with Jackie atop a Hollywood/Beverly Hills bluff. George proposed
          to Jackie, but it was already too late. George learned that Lester
          had left Felicia and was planning to divorce her, and had already proposed
          to Jackie. George realized to his dismay that he had lost Jackie to
          Lester. After she left him, he looked down from a distance and saw
          them drove away on a trip to Acapulco. She had decided that Lester's
          offer of security and financial well-being was more important to her
          than George's irresponsible behavior and promise of sexual fulfillment.</font></p>        </td>
