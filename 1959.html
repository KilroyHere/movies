          <p><font size="2"><b>Anatomy of a Murder (1959), </b>160 minutes, D:
              Otto Preminger<br />
              Director Otto Preminger's daring and controversial courtroom drama
            was about an explosive rape and murder investigation and trial, based
              upon a real-life case. The film opened with Saul Bass' stylized
              designs for the title credits. Army officer Lt. Frederick Manion
              (Ben Gazzara) was charged with the first-degree murder of the bartender
              and keeper-owner of Thunder Bay Inn, Bernard &quot;Barney&quot; Quill. Quill
               had allegedly sexually assaulted Laura Manion (Lee Remick), his
              attractive wife. Manion turned himself in after shooting and killing
              Quill an hour after the rape (pre-meditated and cold-blooded),
              alleging that Quill had raped her. Crafty, country-styled
              small-town defense lawyer Paul &quot;Pauly&quot; Biegler
              (James Stewart), more interested in jazz piano and fishing than trying cases, was hired to represent
          and defend Manion. He received a phone call from Laura Manion  asking
              him to defend her husband in the impending case. When Biegler first
              met Laura, he noticed her right black eye behind her sunglasses
              (she claimed it was from a rape incident, although it was also
          probable her husband slapped her). A doctor had examined Laura and
          said he didn't think she had been raped. [Note:
            There was always the possibility that Laura was bartender Quill's
            lover and that Manion killed him and beat her up when he discovered
          them together.] Biegler took a strategic tactic - he urged his client
              to claim that he had no memory of the homicide in the tavern (even
              though five shots were fired) and to plead temporary insanity (or &quot;irresistible
          impulse&quot;). Was Manion truly legally sane or insane?
          Biegler eventually was able to persuade level headed, even-tempered
          Judge Weaver (Joseph Welch) to rule in his favor and get Laura Manion's
          rape issue into the record. The tough prosecutor
          facing Biegler was flamboyant, tough &quot;big city&quot; co-counsel
          and assistant prosecuting attorney Claude Dancer (George C. Scott),
          who tried to paint Laura as a trampy, provocative woman. The trial
          contained daring details, testimony, and evidence regarding contraceptives,
          rape charges, and the entering into evidence of white or pink nylon
          lace &quot;lost panties&quot; (allegedly torn
          off by Quill) - later verified by the inn manager Mary Pilant (Kathryn
          Grant). She had found  them in Quill's laundry
          chute, and then it was shockingly revealed that Quill was actually
          Mary's father and she was his illegitimate daughter. In the quick conclusion
          to the case, Manion was found not guilty (by reason of temporary insanity
          at the time of the shooting). He unexpectedly left town with Laura
          (who was seen crying) with only a note for Biegler,
          explaining that he was seized by an &quot;irresistible impulse&quot; to
          leave. Evidence at the trailer park in their
           trash barrel suggested that Manion was a heavy gin drinker who beat
          Laura before they left (the reason for her tears). It was highly  possible
           that the Manions had duped everyone - Laura's sexual encounter with
          Quill was consensual (and not rape) and that Manion had killed Quill
          out of drunken jealousy. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: William Wyler<br />
            Director William Wyler's renowned, Best Picture-winning Biblical
            epic of enormous scale was the winner of 11 Oscars. The  character-driven,
              action-filled, star-studded extravaganza filmed in Italy was  
              one of the cinema's greatest epics - a compelling human story
              of revenge, bitterness, redemption and forgiveness.  It told about
            friendship and then adult enmity between boyhood pals. The 1880 novel
            by Lew Wallace had previously been adapted into an 1899 stage adaptation
            and into a silent film <i>Ben-Hur:
            A Tale of the Christ (1925)</i> starring  Ramon Novarro. The
            film's opening was a series of tableaux of Christ's birth and the
            coming of the Magi, followed by the conquering Romans marching into
            Jerusalem. The wealthy and influential Prince
            of Judea, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) was reunited with his boyhood
            friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), newly-appointed Roman Tribune and
            member of the Roman legions. The two loyal and old friends toasted
            to each other and expressed their closeness
              by embracing, and engaging in a friendly spear-throwing contest
              (exclaiming: &quot;Down Eros, up Mars!&quot;). Messala was potentially
              Judah's avowed enemy, although they pledged to each other as they
              crossed arms: (Messala: &quot;It's
              an insane world, but in it there's one sanity, the loyalty of old
              friends. Judah, we must believe in one another&quot;). Shortly
              later, a rift developed between Judah and Messala  when Judah
              was asked to betray his people, turn traitor (and reveal names
              of Jews who opposed Roman rule) and help Rome: &quot;I'd
              rather be a fool than a traitor or a killer...Rome is evil....I
              warn you. Rome is an affront to God. Rome is strangling my people
              and my country and the whole Earth, but not forever. I tell you,
              the day Rome falls, there will be a shout of freedom such as the
              world has never heard before&quot;; Messala offered Judah a choice: &quot;Either
              you help me or you oppose me. You have no other choice. You're
              either for me or against me&quot;
          - and Judah chose decisively: &quot;I am against you!&quot;  Judah's
          family members were falsely accused of treason (after an unfortunate
          accident during a Roman parade), and Ben-Hur was condemned and sentenced
          to exile as a slave on a Roman galley ship - Judah vowed revenge: &quot;May
          God grant me vengeance. I pray that you live till I return.&quot; His
          family members - his mother Miriam (Martha Scott) and
          his sister Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell) were  banished and enslaved. (Years
            later, they had contracted leprosy and were confined to the Valley
            of the Lepers, while Judah believed that they were dead). During
          a forced march of slaves across the desert, the dehydrated Judah Ben-Hur
          cried out: &quot;God, help me&quot; in Nazareth - and was given water
          by a defiant Jesus. Aboard the galley slave ships,
          Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) noticed Ben-Hur's steely
          determination - and learned he had already served over three years:
          &quot;You have the spirit to fight back but the good sense to control
          it. Your eyes are full of hate, Forty-One. That's good. Hate keeps
          a man alive. It gives him strength.&quot; During a slave galley ship
          battle against the Macedonians' pirate war ships, Judah was able to
          miraculously save many of the slaves and Arrius himself - and  the
          Romans were victorious although five ships were lost. Arrius told Ben-Hur: &quot;In
          his eagerness to save you, your God has also saved the Roman fleet.&quot; Judah
          was adopted by Arrius, and during a spectacular
          reception scene in Rome, the victorious Arrius
          and Ben-Hur rode in a chariot together, and were recognized by Emperor
          Tiberius (George Relph). Judah became a respected
          citizen and a famed chariot racer under the tutelage of an Arabian
          horse racer (Hugh Griffith). He finally met his
          rival Messala in a justly famous 11-minute long chariot race - often
          regarded as one of the most exciting action sequences ever filmed.
          The race was prefaced by a lengthy
          and impressive Parade of the Charioteers, when they paraded around
          the ring in a display of pageantry; the setting was majestic with a
          central divider strip composed of three statues thirty feet high, and
          grandstands on all sides, rising five stories high with immense crowds.
          Messala suffered a gruesome deathbed scene after his defeat in the
          arena, when he called for Ben-Hur - delaying an operation to amputate
          his legs that would attempt to save his life; Messala was bitter and
          had one last card to play: &quot;Triumph complete, Judah. The race
          won. The enemy destroyed...What do you think you see? The smashed body
          of a wretched animal! Is enough of a man still left here for you to
          hate? Let me help you...You think they're dead. Your mother and sister.
          Dead. And the race over. It isn't over, Judah. They're not dead...Look
          for them in the Valley of the Lepers, if you can recognize them. (Messala
          grabbed Judah's clothing) It goes on. It goes on, Judah. The race,
          the race is not over.&quot; Upon his return to
          Judea, Ben-Hur was able to rescue his suffering, leprous family from
          the Valley of the Lepers, with the help of his love interest Esther
          (Haya Harareet), his steward Simonides' (Sam Jaffe) grown daughter.
          He also witnessed the crucifixion of Jesus - on his way to Golgotha.
          In a reversal of roles - Judah followed along behind Jesus as he was
          being led to his crucifixion, and as the carpenter once gave him water
          in Nazareth, so did Ben-Hur offer the agonized 'King of the Jews' water
          when he fell. Ben-Hur's leprosy-afflicted mother and sister were healed
          by a cleansing rain, and Judah became transfixed and transformed by
          the power of the crucifixion - he spoke of the miracle to Esther and
          how he was inspired to convert to Christianity: &quot;Almost
            at the moment he died, I heard him say it, 'Father, forgive them,
            for they know not what they do.'...Even then. And I felt His voice
          take the sword out of my hand.&quot; The film's final image was of
          the high place with three empty crosses as a shepherd drove his flock
          before the hill.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Best of Everything (1959)</b>, 121 minutes,
            D: Jean Negulesco <br />
          Jean Negulesco's glossy, explosive, and ahead-of-its-time soap opera
          was an underrated CinemaScopic campy melodrama. Adapted from Rona Jaffe's
          1958 best-selling novel, it was the urban equivalent of <i>Peyton Place</i>.
            One of its most famous quotes was: &quot;Here's to men! Bless their clean-cut
            faces and dirty little minds!&quot;  The influential film was advertised
            as a cinematic work that: &quot;Nakedly Explores the Female Jungle Where
            Women Fight and Love Their Way to the Top - To Get the Things and Men
            They Want!&quot; It also stated in the trailer that: &quot;It undresses
            the ambitions and emotions of the girls who invade the glamour world
            of the big city, seeking success, love, marriage, and the best of everything...and
            who often settle for much less.&quot; It was Hollywood's look at the
            new sexual morality of the time (&quot;This is a story of the female
            jungle, of the girls who didn't marry at twenty, and of the men who wanted
            them - but not as wives&quot;). It told about three aspiring young
            starlet-secretaries in the glamorous world of publishing in New York
            City, at the Fabian Publishing Company. Its social themes included
            the world of working women and adultery, love vs. career, unwed pregnancy,
            abortion, casting couch seduction, and alcoholism. The three struggling
            yet ambitious working women looking for men to marry (and fulfillment)
            included secretary Caroline Bender (Hope Lange), naive and virginal
            April Morrison (Diane Baker), and aspiring actress Gregg Adams (Suzy
            Parker). The film also implied what might happen to a working woman
            if she never married - the result would be the ruthless, bitter,
            unhappy, sterile and calculating editor Amanda Farrow (aging star
            Joan Crawford), who was engaged in an unsatisfying affair with a
            married man. The chain-smoking Amanda eventually married an old acquaintance,
            a widower from Illinois, but was dissatisfied with her new life of
        domesticity and returned to the work world.</font></p></td>

              Fleischer<br />
              This film-noirish biopic was a modified version of the Nathan Leopold-Richard
              Loeb case from the mid-1920s, when two 18 year-old killers, law
              students at the Univ. of Chicago, were defended by famed Clarence
              Darrow. Likewise in the film set in 1924, two University of Chicago
              law students, Judd Steiner (Dean Stockwell) and Arthur
          &quot;Artie&quot; Straus (Bradford Dillman) were both rich, spoiled,
          and elitist genuises, with a dominant-submissive relationship to each
          other - Artie was the bullying and sadistic one. [Note: There was also
          the strong possibility of a homosexual relationship, although that
          had to be avoided due to censorship of films at the time.] They kidnapped
          young Paulie Kessler as a thrill, as an attempt to commit the &quot;perfect
          crime,&quot; and as a way to taunt law-enforcement. During the incident,
          Paulie was killed (by a blow to the head from a blunt instrument),
          and afterwards his body was drowned in a park. However, Steiner lost
          his glasses at the crime scene - a crucial piece of evidence. The case
          was helped by the investigation of their law school colleague Sid Brooks
          (Martin Milner), who worked part-time for the <i>Globe</i> newspaper.
          The two killers continued their crime spree - after Straus challenged
          Steiner to rape Sid's girlfriend Ruth Evans (Diane Varsi), although
          he didn't carry through with the sexual assault when Ruth reacted with
          compassion rather than resistance. A tough DA Henry Horn (E.G. Marshall)
          traced the glasses back to Steiner. The two made a detailed confession
          and blamed each other, before the case went to trial. Legendary
          socialist lawyer Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles) was hired by the defendants'
          wealthy parents to defend them. During the trial, Horn delivered an
          opening statement, which was followed by Wilk's shrewd change of the
          clients' plea to guilty, to eliminate trial by jury. He realized there
          was overwhelming evidence against his clients, that would assure them
          of a harsh punishment. For ten days, Wilk introduced psychological
          evidence to show how mentally ill the two remorseless defendants were,
          but not insane. He did not want to plead an insanity case (which would
              also require the jury). He wanted to plead their case solely before
              the judge. The film's most dramatic and flamboyant moments came
              during Wilk's closing argument (the longest true monologue in film
              history) - an eloquent diatribe against capital punishment (&quot;I'm
              pleading for love&quot;), when he stated that the barbaric practice
              should be ended. He conceded that his clients were guilty and made
              an impassioned plea against the state being able to execute the
              two youths regardless of the severity of their pre-meditated crime.
              The judge was persuaded - he sentenced the two to life imprisonment,
          plus 99 years. </font></p>        </td>

            Robert Wise </font><br />
            <font size="2">Director Robert Wise's engrossing, landmark, noirish
          crime melodrama  was the first film noir with a black protagonist 
            (Harry Belafonte, who also produced the film through his own independent
            company HarBel). The late 1950s B-film's character-driven story,
            shot on location in NYC, presented cautionary and pessimistic themes,
            foremost in the era of racial unrest and uncertainty, including 
            volatile bigotry, greed and the weak human impulse toward self-destruction.
            In the heist film's plot set in the city, three desperate men were
            teamed up to commit a bank robbery. In the end, they were ultimately
            stymied by racial tensions and prejudice; one of the criminal members,
            a white, unstable bigoted ex-con, faced off against the troubled
            black member of the gang in a deadly, fiery shootout in a fuel storage
            facility, reminiscent of the conclusion of Raoul Walsh's classic
            film noir <a href="whit.html"><i>White Heat (1949)</i></a>. In the
            plot, disgraced, elderly ex-copper and ex-con David Burke (Ed Begley)
            was able to entice two other desperate men to join him for a small-town
            bank robbery: bigoted, tough-guy loser-drifter Earl Slater (Robert
            Ryan), and handsome, black nightclub entertainer Johnny Ingram (Harry
            Belafonte), who was horse-racing gambling-addicted and was being
            pressured to pay $7,500 dollars to strong-armed Italian mobster Bacco
            (Will Kuluva). The troubled and debt-ridden Johnny Ingram was heavily
            burdened by both the shark-mobster's interest-on-debt payments and
            his court-ordered alimony payments to his middle-class ex-wife Ruth
            (Kim Hamilton) who lived uptown with their daughter Eadie (Lois Thorne).
            The hot-headed Slater, who lived in a two-room apartment with girlfriend
            Lorry (Shelley Winters), was financially-dependent upon her and felt
            humiliated and trapped like a &quot;kept&quot; man.
          Slater  had entered into a brief affair with flirtatious, upstairs
          married neighbor and <i>femme fatale</i> Helen (Gloria Grahame), who
          had become sexually-excited after cautiously asking him about his 
           dark past and crime of manslaughter. During initial planning of the
          heist with Burke, Slater often expressed his racist attitude toward
          the third member of the gang, after initially asking Burke: &quot;You
          didn't say nothin about the third man bein' a n----r!&quot;; Slater
          refused to be partnered with a black man but reluctantly went along
          with the plan. The heist of the First National Bank in upstate Melton,
          NY was designed to take advantage of weak security on a Thursday evening
          after hours, when the bank was filled with cash. The plan was botched
          when Burke with a huge bag of cash exited the building and happened
          to be spotted by a passing police car. He was lethally shot on the
          sidewalk, while his two partners were unable to flee the scene in the
          parked getaway car. Slater, ignoring the original plan (because of
          his deep distrust of Ingram), had given the getaway car keys to Burke.
          The two were forced to flee on foot to a nearby oil refinery (with
          large holding tanks for fuel), as they began firing at each other during
          a vicious, volatile and confrontational firefight between them. The
          film concluded with their incineration in the fuel refinery that exploded
          in flames. The next day, authorities viewed two burned-to-a-crisp bodies
          and observed how there were no differences between the unrecognizable
          corpses on stretchers; one asked:
          &quot;Which is which?&quot; and another replied: &quot;Take your pick&quot;;
          a damaged sign presented the film's moral lesson: &quot;STOP DEAD END&quot; -
          it was a cautionary warning about how racial animosity must stop or
          it would lead to death. </font></p>

            From Outer Space)</b>, 80 minutes, D. Ed Wood  <br />
            Although universally acknowledged as one
            of the 'worst' films ever made, with an incoherent plot, cheap production
            design and props (e.g., cardboard gravestones, and a paper-plate
            alien spaceship), nighttime scenes obviously shot during the daytime,
            inexcusable special effects, and horrible acting, director Ed Wood's
            sci-fi zombie horror film was still important in cinematic history.
            It marked the final role for horror icon Bela Lugosi, and some of
            the film was referenced in Tim Burton's biopic <i>Ed
            Wood (1994)</i>, with Ed Wood played by Johnny Depp. In the film's opening, narrator
            Criswell (LA TV personality in his feature film debut) spoke directly
            to the audience to introduce the film's suppressed news story - the
            arrival of alien invaders from outer space (&quot;My friend, can your
            heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?&quot;).
            Onboard a commercial airliner, the pilots spotted a shiny flying
            saucer high above San Fernando Valley. The UFO saucer landed in a
            cemetery graveyard in the area, where a burial ceremony was just
            ending for a grieving old man (Bela Lugosi) whose wife had died.
            Gravediggers were spooked by the landing, and as they were leaving,
            they were frightened by the sight of the old man's wife - now a resurrected
            Vampire Girl (Maila &quot;Vampira&quot; Nurmi),
            and both of them were killed. The next day, the saddened old man
            died and was also buried in the graveyard's crypt, but then he was
            also raised from the dead as Ghoul Man. The police, including overweight
            Inspector Daniel Clay (Tor Johnson), were alerted to investigate
            the murder of the two gravediggers. Vampire Girl and Ghoul Man attacked
            and killed Clay. Flying saucers were also reported in the skies over
            Hollywood and Washington, D.C. It was then revealed that the extra-terrestrial
            aliens in the various spacecraft had a strategic plan. Wearing  silk
            pajamas and piloting one saucer, space soldier Commander Eros (Dudley
            Manlove) and his mate Tanna (Joanna Lee) had been directed by their
            Ruler (John Breckinridge) to implement a plan known as &quot;Plan
            9&quot; (after eight failed plans). Their objective was to stop humanity
            from creating a doomsday nuclear weapon (&quot;Solaranite bombs&quot; that
            could destroy the sun) and obliterating the entire universe. The aliens' plan was to use
            their electrode guns to revive, animate and resurrect the Earth's
            dead (ghouls or undead zombies) from the graveyard, to serve in a
            zombie army of the dead to march and conquer Earth and its humans
            before mankind destroyed itself in a devastating apocalypse. The
            Pentagon and General Roberts (Lyle Talbot) were aware of the cemetery
            incidents, had been in contact with the aliens for years, and had
            made previous attempts to shoot down the alien ships. Reportedly,
            the aliens had been unsuccessful in the past of convincing earthlings
            of their actual existence and technological superiority. In the film's
            climactic conclusion, after a few humans attempted to stop the aliens,
            their flaming saucer lifted off from the cemetery and exploded over
            Hollywood. In the film's short epilogue, Criswell returned to warn:
            &quot;My friend, you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.
            Can you prove that it didn't happen? Perhaps on your way home someone
            will pass you in the dark, and you will never know it, for they will
            be from outer space. Many scientists believe that another world is
            watching us at this moment. We once laughed at the horseless carriage,
            the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins, radio,
            and even television. And now some of us laugh at outer space. God
            help us in the future.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Rio Bravo (1959), </b>141 minutes, D: Howard Hawks<br />
            Director Howard Hawks' traditional western was conceived as a rebuking
                response to Fred Zinnemann's <a href="high.html"><i>High Noon
                (1952)</i></a> and
            its main character Marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper). In this film,
            a self-reliant Sheriff in the town of Rio Bravo, Texas remained a
            heroic figure who refused to beg others for help. [Note: Two
            similar remakes by Hawks of the film included <i>El Dorado (1966)</i> and <i>Rio
        Lobo (1970)</i> - both again starring John Wayne.] The western was set
        in the small Texas town of Rio Bravo (in Presidio County) in the late
        1860s, where  tough and heroic Sheriff
        John T. Chance (John Wayne) arrested Joe Burdette (Claude Akins)  
        for killing an unarmed, innocent bystander in the
        local El Toro Rojo cantina-saloon.  The arrest became problematically
        dangerous, since Burdette was the brother of wealthy, influential, and
        powerful rancher Nathan Burdette (John Russell). The vast majority of
        the film involved interactions between the characters over a prolonged,
        multi-day siege period, while Joe Burdette was being held in Chance's
            jail and his brother Nathan and other hired
          guns (paid with $50 dollar gold pieces)  caused trouble
        and planned a jail-break. Sheriff Chance was determined to keep his prisoner
        in custody until the US Marshal arrived in six days time. Chance was
        aided by a strange grouping of individuals who were deputized, outnumbered,
        and continually besieged: elderly, toothless, crippled (&quot;game-legged&quot;),
        jumpy but loyal crippled sidekick Stumpy (Walter Brennan), derelict,
              alcoholic barfly Dude (Dean Martin)
			   (nicknamed <em>Borachon,</em> meaning
          &quot;drunk&quot;) - an ex-deputy, and baby-faced,
          brave, two pistols-gunslinger greenhorn and singer Colorado Ryan (Ricky
          Nelson). The Sheriff also became involved in an on-again/off-again
          'romance' with attractive, independent,
            strong-minded and alluring stagecoach passenger and gambler's widow,
            22 year-old Feathers (Angie Dickinson), a dance-hall entertainer
          who became stranded in the town's Hotel Alamo. When wagon-train leader
          Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) was murdered in cold blood by one of Burdette's
          paid assassins, the tenseness of the situation intensified. After a
          few deadly shootouts and gunfights, there was a final hostage swap
          (exchanging Dude for Burdette) at Nathan Burdette's creek-side
          warehouse where Burdette's gunmen quickly surrendered when overcome
          by Stumpy's clever use of dynamite sticks. In the concluding scene,
          Sheriff Chance and Feathers finally decided to end their verbal sparring
          and settle their differences by becoming a couple. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Billy Wilder<br />
          Director Billy Wilder's wonderfully-satirical, funny comedy spoofed
          the gangster films of the 1920s (with speakeasies, mobsters, bootlegging,
          machine-gun fire, and gambling). It has been honored continually as
          one of the greatest comedies of all time. In the film's opening, two
            mostly unemployed, late 20's era Chicago jazz musicians in a speakeasy
          band: saxophone player Joe (Tony Curtis) and bassist Jerry (Jack Lemmon),
          accidentally witnessed the St. Valentine's Day Massacre (February 14,
          1929), and were forced to flee from Chicago hitmen, ordered by notorious
          dime-flipping, spats-wearing crime-boss ringleader Spats Columbo (George
          Raft). To disguise themselves and elude the pursuit of retaliatory
          bootleggers, the two masqueraded as high-heeled, wigged women - Jo-sephine
          and Daphne - and they joined Sweet Sue's (Joan Shawlee) all-girl band
          (&quot;Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators&quot;) with luscious, voluptuous
          singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) heading for Florida on
          a train. They soon met fellow band member Sugar (who sang and played
          a ukelele), revealed to be a lush. Jo-sephine quickly fell in love
          with Sugar, especially after she told him about her past bad luck with
          romance and her soft-spot for saxophone players. Once the train arrived
          in Florida and the band settled into the Seminole-Ritz Hotel, Jerry-Daphne
          (who was impressed with his own new sexy image) was coaxed by Joe to
          attract the attention of one of the hotel's guests - the real millionaire
          - a smitten, oft-wed Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) in his late
          50s, so that Joe could then assume the identity of a wealthy, glasses-wearing
          Cary Grant-like oil man named &quot;Junior&quot;
           to manipulatively have Sugar fall in love with him on Fielding's yacht.
           In one of the film's more hilarious scenes, he pretended to have a
           problem with impotence to encourage Sugar to seduce him. At the same
           time, Jerry as Daphne underwent an identity crisis with his alter
           ego, and after a night of  dancing the tango at a club with Osgood,
           he/she decided to marry him, and they improbably became engaged. Everything
           was turned upside down when the Chicago hitmen accompanied by Spats
           arrived at the same Florida hotel for a convention of &quot;Friends
           of Italian Opera,&quot; to disrupt their various gender-bending escapades. In the madcap ending, Spats
           and his entourage were machine-gunned down by rival gangsters led
           by Little Bonaparte (Nehemiah Persoff) during a fake birthday celebration
           (one assassin burst out of a large cake). The film concluded with
           Joe (who had revealed himself) with Sugar, and Daphne with Osgood
           as they retreated to the yacht in a speedboat. When Jerry broke the
           news of his identity by ripping off his wig to the expectant Osgood,
           the unruffled millionaire replied non-chalantly that he didn't seem
           to mind: &quot;Nobody's perfect&quot; - 
	      the greatest fade-out line in film history.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Joseph L. Mankiewicz<br />
              Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's melodramatic and lurid adaptation
              of Tennessee Williams' 1958 play and Gore Vidal's screen adaptation
              had to be toned down due to allusions to homosexuality, cannibalism,
              pedophilia, and incest. Mrs. Violet Venable (Katharine Hepburn),
              a prominent, rich and elegant Southern belle widow in New Orleans,
              descended in an elevator into the lobby of her Byzantine-decorated
              front lobby to speak to Dr. Cukrowicz (Montgomery Clift) about
              her foundation's financial gift to the Lions View State Asylum,
              in exchange for the promise of a lobotomy to be performed on her
              institutionalized niece at St. Mary's -  New Orleans debutante
              Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor). As she toured through her deceased,
              idolized son Sebastian's outdoor primordial jungle with the doctor,
              Violet kept hinting about the circumstances of his death (in Catherine's
              presence in Spain), and how Catherine's &quot;obscene babbling&quot; and
              lies about her son and his demise needed to be silenced by a lobotomizing
              brain surgery. Mrs. Venable recalled an earlier trip to the Galapagos
              Islands (Encantadas) with Sebastian as they witnessed the horrible
              devouring of newly-hatched young sea turtles by black vultures
              in the sky, as they dangerously navigated their way back to the
              sea. Mrs. Grace Holly (Mercedes McCambridge),
              Catherine's avaricious mother, and Catherine's brother George Holly
              (Gary Raymond) arrived to follow through on Aunt Violet's generous
                offer to gather up Sebastian's clothes and wardrobe for the college-bound
            George. Catherine also described for Dr. Cukrowicz
            her recollections of a Mardi Gras ballroom incident in which she
            'lost her honor' with a married man (who admitted his wife was pregnant).
            It was the first time that Sebastian noted the power of Catherine's
            attractiveness. After being transferred by Dr. Cukrowicz to Lions
            View (with the implicit understanding that her transfer was in exchange
            for submitting to a lobotomy), she was visited by her mother and
            brother, who were there to have Catherine sign business papers (demanded
            by Violet) so they could receive $100,000 in inheritance money -
            of course, Catherine was horrified and refused. In a stunning scene,
            the hospitalized Catherine tried to escape and walked across a catwalk
            in Lions View, where other 'crazed' male inmates reached out to touch
            her legs from below. In the concluding scene set in the Venable home's
            jungle-garden, there were impressionistic flashbacks of Catherine's
            recounting of her day at the beach the previous summer in Spain (Cabeza
            de Lobo), after her homosexual cousin Sebastian (unseen fully in
            the film) had bought her a white one-piece bathing suit that became
            transparent when wet - deliberately used to lure in males for his
            own pleasure. Catherine delivered a climactic
            monologue and accounting of a surreal murder scene - a horrifying
            incident (cannibalistic homicide by ravenous Spanish youths) after
            Sebastian was chased up a steep set of streets to the ruins of an
            ancient stone temple where he was ravaged by the young boys (who
            was assumed to be seeking revenge after being exploited by Sebastian
            for homosexual encounters). I n the film's conclusion, Mrs. Venable
            became delusional while Catherine was cured and spared from being
            further institutionalized and lobotomized. </font></p>        </td>

          </b></i>This bold, lengthy drama was based upon Richard P. Powell's 1956 novel
		   &quot;The Philadelphian.&quot; In the film's
            opening, William Lawrence III (Adam West) of the upper-class Philadelphian
            family married Kate Judson (Diane Brewster). On their wedding night,
            he confessed that he was unable to have sex with her - due to his
            homosexuality (not stated directly in the film). Ashamed, he fled
            from her and died in an automobile accident. Kate sought comfort
            and sex with longtime working class friend Mike Flanagan (Brian
            Keith), and they had a child within the year. The boy, given the
            last name of &quot;Lawrence&quot; to maintain the family line,
            became known as Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Judson Lawrence (Paul
            Newman), who would eventually become an aspiring lawyer. The secret
            of his father's identity (and the Lawrence fortune) was kept from
            him. In law school, Tony's playboy friend Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Gwynn
            (Robert Vaughn) introduced him to socialite Joan Dickinson (Barbara
            Rush). Although they fell in love, Joan dumped Tony when she learned
            that her father Gilbert Dickinson (John Williams) had offered (or
            bribed) Tony with a position in the prestigious Dickinson law firm,
            in exchange for postponing marriage to Joan. In spite, she married
            aristocratic millionaire Carter Henry (Anthony Eisley). Tony acquired
            a summer law job with John Marshall Wharton (Otto Kruger), the
            head of another Philadelphia law firm, stealing the position away
            from fellow student Louis Donetti (Paul Picerni), and he soon acquired
            a permanent job (as a tax specialist) with the Wharton firm after
            serving in the Korean War. Due to his expertise and success with
            wealthy clients (such as Mrs. J. Arthur Allen (Billie Burke)),
            Tony was made a partner. Then, his often-drunk friend Chet was
            arrested for first degree murder of his uncle Morton Stearnes (Robert
            Douglas) - who had a tight clamp on Chet's inheritance. Without
            criminal trial experience, tax attorney Tony decided to represent
            Chet. Further complications arose when Tony's parents Kate and
            Mike revealed the shocking truth of his real parentage to him,
            and Morton's brother, family patriarch Dr. Shippen Stearnes (Frank
            Conroy), threatened to publically reveal that Tony's real father
            was Mike Flanagan if Tony didn't do well. During the trial, Tony took up Chet's
            defense, while DA Louis Donetti prosecuted the murder case. On
            the witness stand, one of the last witnesses - Morton Stearnes'
            butler George Archibald (Richard Deacon) stated that he assumed
            Chet was drinking alone in the study. Then, he heard a noise and
            a gunshot. Morton was found dead with a gun next to him, while
            Chet was nowhere to be seen. During Tony's cross-examination, the
            butler's testimony was discredited with a failed sniffing test
            of various drinking glasses. The butler also admitted that he never
            saw Chet and Morton together in the study. And George also agreed
            that the noise might have been Chet leaving through the garden
            gate, long before Morton committed suicide. Then, Dr. Shippen Stearnes
            revealed that Morton had a brain tumor and was mentally depressed
            - a major rationale for suicide. The jury ruled that Chet was not
            guilty of the murder. As a result of Tony's successful defense,
            a reconciled Joan (whose husband died in the Korean War) and Tony
        made wedding plans. </font></p></td>
