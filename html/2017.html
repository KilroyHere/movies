      <p><font size="2"><b>Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</b>, 164 minutes, D: Denis Villeneuve<br />
        This sci-fi sequel set 30 years after Ridley Scott's earlier classic <a href="blad.html"><i>Blade
                Runner (1982)</i></a>  was a long-awaited addition to
        the franchise. In the story set in the year 2049, a Nexus-9 replicant
                LAPD 'blade runner' K (Ryan Gosling) was on the hunt for Sapper
                Morton (Dave Bautista), an older breed of rogue replicant, and
                was able to 'retire' (kill) him at a protein farm. He discovered
                a box buried in the ground (containing the remains of a female
                replicant who died during a caesarean section) and
                a date (6-10-21) (presumably the date of the child's birth) carved
                at the base of a dead tree trunk. His boss Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright)
                feared that if replicants could reproduce, it would mean trouble.
                He was sent on a new mission - to find the possible replicant
                child and kill it. The deceased female mother was identified
                as Rachael (designed by Dr. Tyrell from the previous film) who
                was romantically tied to former blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison
                Ford). Meanwhile, super-strong replicant enforcer Luv (Sylvia
                Hoeks) was dispatched by powerful replicant maker CEO Niander
                Wallace (Jared Leto) to steal Rachael's remains and to follow
                K to Rachael's child. One of K's additional clues was his memory
                (implanted?) of a carved wooden toy horse, and he soon began
                to suspect that he was Rachael's child who was raised in a San
                Diego orphanage. Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri) - a replicant
                memory designer/creator, confirmed K's suspicions, and tests
                at K's headquarters confirmed that he was a rogue replicant.
                The trail led to Deckard who was in hiding in the ruins of Las
                Vegas, where he admitted he was the father of Rachael's child.
                However, a spoiler twist in the solution of the puzzle revealed
                that Dr. Stelline was actually Rachael's child. In the conclusion,
                K fought off the efforts to interrogate and kill Deckard by Luv
                and Wallace, but was mortally-wounded during his valiant rescue
                efforts. After K was able to eliminate Luv before he died, Deckard
                was freed and he met his daughter for the first time, as the
                film ended.</font></p>      </td>

          D: Luca Guadagnino</font><br />
          <font size="2">This artsy coming-of-age romantic drama followed the
          development of a love relationship between two males, based upon a
          2007 novel by Andr&eacute; Aciman. In northern Italy in 1983, a romantic
          summer entanglement occurred between introspective, gifted, musically-talented
          17-year-old Jewish-Italian Elio Perlman (Timoth&eacute;e
          Chalamet) and 24 year-old graduate student assistant Oliver (Armie
          Hammer), working with Elio's father (Michael
          Stuhlbarg) - an archaeology professor. The film followed the slow development
          of their forbidden love, and Elio's struggle (during his first real
          love experience) to deal with his strong, crazy and unexpected homosexual
          feelings. After they slept together for the first time, Oliver told
           Elio: &quot;Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.&quot;</font></p></td>

            the 'Day of the Dead' Mexican holiday, aspiring 12 year-old musician
            Miguel (voice of Anthony Gonzalez) was being brought up in a Mexican
            family of zapateros (shoemakers), who had for generations banned
            playing or listening to music. They reasoned that decades earlier,
            Miguel's great-great-grandfather left his great-great-grandmother
            Imelda (voice of Alanna Ubach) and their young daughter Coco (voice
            of Ana Ofelia Murgu&iacute;a) (Miguel's wheelchair-bound great-grandmother) to
            become a musician, and they were cursed. However, in secret, Miguel
            idolized deceased singer/actor Ernesto de la Cruz (voice of Benjamin
            Bratt) from his hometown, and played a guitar. Magically somehow,
            on the 'Day of the Dead,' Miguel was accidentally transported to
            the Land of the Dead. There, he met deceased skeletal relatives and
            was told that the key to returning to the Land of the Living was
            to receive a dead ancestor's blessing. He sought after de la Cruz,
            whom he mistakenly believed was his great-great-grandfather. He was
            helped by H&eacute;ctor
        (voice of Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal), a trickster who encouraged
        Miguel to help him get back to the Land of the Living - and was revealed
        to be his actual deceased musician great-great-grandfather. Miguel returned
        to his family and reversed their ban on music, while Hector was able
        to see his daughter Coco once again.</font></p>      </td>

        This British historical war drama and biopic was set in May 1940, and
            followed the rise of Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) during his early
            days as Prime Minister during WWII. It also detailed 
            the War Cabinet Crisis, while Nazi Germany's <i>Wehrmacht</i> swept
            across Western Europe and threatened to defeat the United Kingdom.
            In scenes of political dialogue, debate and confrontation, the iconoclastic
            Churchill courageously stood steadfast against Hitler's forces, as
            in the sequence of his  &quot;Blood, toil, tears, and sweat&quot; speech.
            He resisted the superior Axis forces to the end, and was opposed
            to others who recommended negotiation and appeasement policies, such
            as Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), toward the Nazis (his famous &quot;We
            Shall Fight&quot; speech - &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot;),
            even though the UK was vastly outnumbered and faced certain defeat
            and surrender.</font></p></td>

        Based on  a real-life incident during WWII, director Christopher Nolan's
            vividly-presented war drama (told in a tricky, time-bending fashion)
            chronicled one of the turning points of the war in 1940 when 300,000
            Allied soldiers were surrounded and trapped on Dunkirk beach in France,
            and sought evacuation by land, sea, and air. The gripping, violent,
            and intense tale followed British soldiers who sought to find a way
            to cross the Channel back over to England, including one brave British
            private named Tommy (Fionn Whitehead). Civilian volunteers with their
            own boats ferried some soldiers across, while others hid inside an
            abandoned beached trawler while awaiting the tide to rise to carry
            them over. In one particular instance, civilian sailor Mr. Dawson
            (Mark Rylance) with his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) on his boat <i>Moonstone</i>,
            rescued a shell-shocked downed fighter pilot from a wrecked ship.
            British spitfire aircraft valiantly attempted to defend the crossing.
            One fighter pilot named Farrier (Tom Hardy) flew across the Channel
            to Dunkirk, but then his fuel ran out just as an enemy plane attacked.
            He landed on the beach and  was forced to set fire to his plane
            before being taken prisoner by the Germans. Also on the beach, Royal
            Navy Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) was waiting on the dock to
            help in the evacuation of the French.</font></p>      </td>

      In this realistic drama, six-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) lived with
          her unemployed single mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) for $38/night in
          a cheap motel in Kissimmee, Florida, one of a number of Orlando-area
          motels close to Walt Disney World. Most of the residents in the
          Magic Castle Motel - purple in color, infested with bed-bugs and managed
          by protective and patient father figure Bobby Hicks (Willem Dafoe)
          - were unemployed, marginalized or working-class individuals who couldn't
          afford security deposits and were on the verge of homelessness. To
          avoid being considered full-time residents, the motel tenants had to
          vacate one night each month. The
          film followed the lives of a trio of mischievous, unsupervised kids
          (portrayed as &quot;Little Rascals&quot; from <i>Our Gang</i>) who
          were motel residents, including Moonee and her two main friends: downstairs
          neighbor Scooty (Christopher Rivera), and Jancey (Valeria Cotto) (in
          the next-door motel Futureland), who often found
          themselves involved in dangerous misadventures. Desperate for food
          and rent money after losing her job at a strip club, Halley began to
          prostitute herself, eventually leading to the DCF and the police taking
          Moonee away for foster care. The film ended with Moonee and Jancey

      Director Peele's timely and extremely effective and violent horror-thriller
      was filled with twists and turns. The film's story centered around an inter-racial
      couple who had been dating for five months: talented black photographer
      Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his attractive white girlfriend Rose Armitage
      (Allison Williams). During a visit at her parents' home in upstate rural

      menacing, including the odd behavior of the family's
      black servants: housekeeper Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper
      Walter (Marcus Henderson). He was hypnotized to end his smoking addiction
      and put into a trance by Missy (with a stirring tea cup), and descended
      to a void known as the &quot;Sunken Place.&quot; An unexpected group 
	  of privileged and wealthy white people arrived for an annual gathering and auction
	   - including noted blind art gallery owner
      Jim Hudson (Stephen Root) who was particularly interested in Chris and
      his photography skills. After Chris discovered photos of Rose's prior relationships
      with black people, he alerted Rose but then realized that she was in on
      the conspiracy. Chris found himself about to be operated upon by Dean -

            story, but a melancholy poetic meditation with big ideas about time,
            life, love, permanence and the inevitability of death and loss. In
            the drawn-out supernatural tale set in Dallas, TX, a young nameless
            couple: musician husband C (Casey Affleck) and his wife M (Rooney
            Mara) lived in a small house, but were planning on moving. M had
            the strange habit of writing notes and hiding them in the walls of

            but then his mute spirit-ghost (invisible to everyone, but represented
            as a white sheet with cut-out eyeholes) silently returned to linger
            at the house and view his grieving and mourning wife as she continued
            on with her life. She eventually moved out, but left a short note
            hidden in a gap in a wall. The ghost was unable to retrieve the note.
            The ghost (refusing to let go) stayed rooted there as time pressed
            on, with new tenants, new construction, and other time travel elements.
            The film questioned perceptions of time and the existential belief

        A combination of genre and sub-genre elements composed the film -  it
            was a biographical sports black comedy that was loosely based on
            real-life events. The bleak fact-based film detailed the rise and
            tabloid scandal-filled fall of figure skater Tonya Harding (Margot
            Robbie) and her connection to the 1994 attack on her rival Nancy
            Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver). During Harding's lower-class &quot;white trash&quot;
            childhood (a life of abandonment and struggle), she was serially
            abused by both her domineering, blunt, chain-smoking mother LaVona
            Golden (Allison Janney) and her boyfriend/husband Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian
            Stan), but she was able to overcome various obstacles (often class
            based) to become a world-class figure skater. Then, while training
            for the 1994 Winter Olympics, an attack occurred against Harding's
            chief skating rival Nancy Kerrigan, instigated by her ex-husband
            and his bodyguard friend Shawn Eckardt (Paul Walter Hauser) and two
            other morons, and known beforehand by the unlikeable Harding who
            was implicated. Multiple viewpoints of the events were presented,
            sometimes in faux mockumentary-styled interviews, or 'breaking the
            4th wall' moments. Ultimately, the impact of the tragic attack seriously
            affected Harding's fate when a judge banned her from competitive
            figure skating for life.</font></p></td>

          This  third and last film
              in the Wolverine trilogy (following after  <i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine
              (2009)</i> and <i>The Wolverine (2013)</i>) was the 10th installment
              in the entire <i>X-Men</i> film series, and considered as a reboot.
              The film was extremely well-received by
              critics and fans alike, and was one of the most successful films
              in the franchise. Due to its acclaimed script, it became  the first
              superhero film to be nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.
              It was set in a dark future (in the year 2029) where mutants were
              basically extinct. Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) (aka James Howlett)
              was hiding out (near the Mexican border at El Paso, TX) with
              seriously-ill and telepathic Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick
              Stewart), the former X-Men leader who was suffering from degenerative
              brain disease at over 90 years of age. Logan served as one of Charles'
               caregivers. Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook) - the menacing Chief
              of Security (or head enforcer) at Alkali-Transigen, a corrupt
              biotechnology corporation,  was in pursuit of Logan
              (with a lethal group known as the Reavers), and led an attack on
              the hideout while searching for young and mysterious 11 year-old
              mutant Laura Kinney / X-23 (Dafne Keen), an experimental mutant
              child created by the corporation. The main revelation was that
              she had been created from Logan's mutant DNA, and Logan was her
               biological father. Logan's mission was to deliver Laura to a safe
              refuge known as &quot;Eden&quot; in
              North Dakota in just a few days, to enable a group of young mutants
              to cross safely into Canada. During Logan's efforts to save Laura
              and the others, he had to fend off his own Transigen mutant clone
              X-24, that lethally wounded Charles. The film ended with a climactic
              one-on-one fight between Logan (the last of the X-Men) and his
              clone X-24, ending with Logan's death. </font></p>      </td>

          summary would describe that it was set in the segregated 1940s South,
          and told about two WWII veterans (one white and one black) who returned
          to their home town in the Mississippi Delta region, and each were confronted

          &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; consisted of a covered-up classified study
          about the decades-old involvement of the US in the Vietnam War (and
          earlier) that declared the war effort  futile. The
          main characters in the discussions (to publish or not) were <i>Post</i>      newspaper
          publisher and heiress Kay Graham (Meryl Streep) and executive editor
          Ben Bradlee (Tom Hanks). <i>Post</i> Pulitzer-winning political
          reporter Ben Bagdikian (Bob Odenkirk) brought a copy of
          the Pentagon Papers, acquired from Ellsberg, to Bradlee who then had
          to convince the <i>Post's</i> top
          female publisher that the documents needed to be published, although
          the paper was risking its financial future. The <i>Post</i> (and its
          intelligent female publisher-in-chief) bravely stood up for freedom
          of the press (and their First Amendment constitutional rights) and
          decided to be antagonistic to the current and powerful Nixon presidential
          administration by publishing the documents.</font></p>      </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Shape of Water (2017)</b>, 123 minutes, D: Guillermo del Toro<br />
      Del Toro's romantic fantasy  was the unusual story about an empathic love
          that developed between a mute employee at a laboratory and a captured
          humanoid amphibian creature. The Best Picture-winning tale was set
          in Baltimore, MD in the year 1962 (during the Cold War), where mute
          Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) was employed as a nighttime cleaner
          at a high-security, government aerospace facility. The lab was under
          the direction of cruel and mean US Colonel Richard Strickland (Michael
          Shannon) who was in charge of a project to study a recently-acquired &quot;asset&quot; -
          a mysterious, other-worldly, monstrous humanoid &quot;Amphibian Man&quot; (Doug
          Jones) that had been captured from a South American river. One night
          with her talkative best friend and co-worker Zelda Fuller (Octavia
          Spencer), Elisa discovered the non-human being held in a tank of water
          (there were plans to dissect it during the US Space Race), and was
          soon secretly bringing him hard-boiled eggs and playing music. With
          the help of her loyal, closeted next-door neighbor, struggling ad artist
          Giles (Richard Jenkins), a reluctant Zelda, and scientist Hoffstetler
          (Michael Stuhlbarg) (secretly a Russian spy whose real name was Dimitri
          Mosenkov), Elisa helped the creature to escape, and kept him in hiding
          in her bathtub until she could release him into the ocean within days.
          In the exciting and revealing conclusion, after Strickland shot and
          killed Hoffstetler to reveal what he knew, he confronted Elisa and
          Giles as they were releasing the creature into a canal - both the creature
          and Elisa were shot, after which Strickland's throat was lethally slashed
          by the amphibian. With his magical healing abilities,  &quot;Amphibian
          Man&quot; was
          able to heal both of them (and open up covered gills on her neck) before
          they embraced and swam away to live &quot;happily ever after.&quot; </font></p></td>

          152 minutes, D: Rian Johnson<br />
      This installment of the long-running franchise-series was the highest-grossing
      (domestic) film of 2017. This episode followed the story presented in <a href="series-starwars7.html"><i>Episode
      VII - The Force Awakens (2015)</i></a>  that
      was set approximately 30 years after the events of <i><a href="series-starwars6.html">Episode
      VI: The Return of the Jedi (1983)</a></i>. As the film opened, last surviving
      Jedi Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was in hiding as was most of the Resistance.
      The Empire was militarizing into a sinister force known as the First Order,
      headed by the masked, evil, dark-hooded Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) with a red
      lightsaber, and young and ruthless General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), who
      was located at a hidden Starkiller Base (a mobile ice planet). The First
      Order stormtroopers captured the skilled Resistance Starfighter pilot Poe
      Dameron (Oscar Isaac) during their search for a secret, hidden star map
      revealing Skywalker's whereabouts (hidden in Poe's orange
      and white droid-robot astromech BB-8). Rogue stormtrooper FN-2187, later
      renamed Finn (John Boyega) converted to the cause, helped Poe escape from
      the Star Destroyer in a stolen TIE fighter, and then teamed up with skilled
      young orphaned scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley), who was protecting Poe's BB-8
      droid. </font><font size="2">The
      smuggling duo of notorious ex-General and smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford)
      and co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) appeared in a new massive freighter,
      the pirate ship <i>Eravana</i>, and eventually  led
      everyone to the Resistance leader of the New Republic, General  Leia
      Organa (Carrie Fisher), the twin sister of Luke Skywalker, to present her
        
        with BB-8 (and the hidden star map). Meanwhile, Hux was  developing 
      a new superweapon, dubbed Starkiller, capable of directing the Sun's energy
      to decimate star systems. At the Resistance base, the fighters prepared
      for a counter-offensive assault against the Starkiller Base and its superweapon.
      The assault on  the Starkiller
        Base composed the exciting climax of the film, but it was a mixed  
      victory - the First Order base was destroyed, but Han was dead, and Finn
      was seriously injured and unconscious. The restored holographic map to
      Luke's hidden location pointed to  a water-covered planet known as Ahch-To.
      Rey flew there and  stood face-to-face with a cloaked and hooded figure
      - Luke Skywalker.</font></p>      </td>

      This complex crime drama (with elements of a black comedy) with great character
      performances told about a Missouri woman who rented three billboards to
      publicize her daughter's unsolved rape and murder. In the fictional town
      of Ebbing, MO, seven months after the brutal rape/murder of teenaged Angela
      (Kathryn Newton), her inconsolable mother Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand)
      was still grieving, angry, and frustrated that nothing had been discovered
      in an ongoing but failed investigation by dim-witted Chief Bill Willoughby
      (Woody Harrelson) and his second-in-command: racist, violent, often drunk
      redneck Officer Jason Dixon (Sam Rockwell). The determined Mildred </font> <font size="2">
      rented three unused and abandoned billboards near her home and posted in
      large letters: &quot;Raped
      While Dying&quot;, &quot;And
        Still No Arrests?&quot;, and &quot;How Come, Chief Willoughby?&quot; Of
        course, many of the town's citizens reacted with upset to the unfair
        accusations of police incompetence, especially since many townsfolk felt
        sympathy for Chief Willoughby who was suffering from pancreatic cancer.
        Mildred faced many obstacles in her quest for justice - harrassments,
        threats, the Chief's suicide, the destruction of the billboards by an
        arsonist (revealed to be perpetrated by Mildred's own abusive ex-husband
        Charlie Hayes (John Hawkes)), Mildred's retaliation leading to Dixon
        accidentally receiving severe burns, and more delays in finding Angela's
        killer.<br />

      The fourth installment in the  <a href="superheroes-dcextended.html"><i>DC
              Extended Universe (DCEU)</i></a> series-franchise was the first
              original Patty Jenkins' superhero film involving Wonder Woman.
              It  followed the epic adventures and origin
              story of the former princess of the Amazons named Diana Prince,
              who became a super-warrioress (Gal Gadot), after being raised 
              on a paradisical island (the Amazon island of Themyscira). During
              her training, she demanded that her warrior-aunt General Antiope
              (Robin Wright) train her, but at first, her mother Queen Hippolyta
              (Connie Nielsen) forbade it. She was instilled with the Amazons'
              responsibility to protect humanity against their enemy Ares, the
              Greek god of war, and bring peace by using her four special weapons:
              bracelets of victory, the lasso of truth, a battle shield/armor,
              and a magical 'god-killer' sword. </font><font size="2">During
              WWI (the Great War), Diana saved crash-landed US pilot-spy Capt.
              Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) in the sea - her first encounter with
              a man and future love interest. He was a British (Allied) spy being
              pursued by the Germans, who also invaded the Amazons' island but
              were defeated. Feeling dutiful to help those afflicted by the Great
              War in Europe, she was transported back to World War I-era London
              and the Western Front with Steve to save the world and stop the
              war. She targeted two evil individuals: German Army General Ludendorff
              (Danny Huston) (whom she erroneously believed was Ares) who had
              ordered 'mustard gas' to be developed and then used at the Western
              Front, and then villainous Sir Patrick Morgan serving in the Imperial
              War Cabinet in Britain, who was disguised and revealed to be Ares. </font></p>
