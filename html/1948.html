            minutes, D: Michael Gordon <i><b><br />
            </b></i>The film's screenplay was adapted from
          Ernst Lothar's novel &quot;The Mills of God&quot; - it was a poignant,
          film-noirish melodrama about a controversial topic. Strict and unyielding
          small town Pennsylvania Judge Calvin Cooke (Fredric March) was known
              as &quot;Old Man Maximum&quot; for his reputation of following &quot;the
              letter of the law&quot; and delivering harsh sentences. He was
              devoted to wife Catherine (or &quot;Cathy&quot;) (Florence Eldridge)
              and their volatile law student daughter Ellie Cooke (Geraldine
              Brooks). However, he did not approve of the relationship Ellie
              was having with young defense attorney David Douglas (Edmond O'Brien),
              who interpreted the law more liberally. Cooke's wife had increasing
              symptoms of blurred vision and frequent severe headaches. The family
              physician Doctor Walter Morrison (Stanley Ridges) diagnosed a terminal
              illness: a fatal brain tumor. He kept the news secret from Cathy
              but not from Calvin. During a second honeymoon trip (a weekend
              outing) with Calvin, Cathy discovered her prescription for toxic
              Demarine pain pills and the doctor's description of her illness
              (hidden in her husband's suitcase), but did not reveal what she
              had found. During the trip home by car, after stopping at a roadside
              gas station garage and cafe, Cathy collapsed. The Cooke's car crashed
              through an embankment on a mountainous road - and Cathy was killed,
              while Calvin was injured, and afterwards, he  had to walk with
              a cane). After the crash, he implored the DA to indict him for
              murdering his wife - he claimed he intentionally drove off the
              road during the raging storm to cause the accident - and set up
              the mercy killing (or euthanasia) to relieve his wife's suffering.
              The film's tagline summarized the judicial proceedings in the film: &quot;MERCY
              or MURDER? Can you condemn this man?&quot; Acting as his own lawyer,
              Calvin pleaded guilty of murder before Judge Ogden (John McIntire),
              who appointed (under Cooke's protest) David Douglas as Cooke's
              lawyer at the sentencing hearing. Douglas ordered an autopsy -
              the results revealed that Cathy had died of a pain-killer drug
              overdose before the crash. Witnesses corroborated her story that
              she filled the prescription at the hotel with a pharmacist, and
              took the pills at the cafe before the crash. The judge dismissed
              the charges, ruling that Cooke was legally innocent, but his moral
              intentions were guilty. He was saved by the unforgiving legal code
              that declared she was already dead. Cooke had a change of heart
              about his judicial attitudes, promising to be more lenient, compassionate,
              and respectful of moral circumstances and personal situations during
              trials - he was finally in agreement with Douglas and his daughter. </font></p>        </td>

                di Biciclette, or Bicycle Thieves)</strong>, 98 minutes, D: Vittorio
                De Sica<br />
                Director Vittorio De Sica's Best Foreign Film Oscar winner (before
                the category was officially created) was an all-time classic
                Neo-realism film (with an amateur, unprofessional cast filmed
                in non-studio locations). The humanistic film's simple, tragic,
                yet compelling story, based on Luigi Bartolini's novel, was about
                the desperate economic plight of a prototypical Italian after
                the war. In post WWII Italy during a time of unemployment and devastation, the bicycle
                of an impoverished, working-class family man, Antonio Ricci (Lamberto
                Maggiorani) was stolen in the ruined city of Rome while he was
                hanging up a film poster of Rita Hayworth on a ladder, on the
                first day of his job. His wife Maria Ricci (Lianella Carell)
                had sold their linen sheets for 7,500 lira to a pawnshop, allowing
                him to buy back his own bicycle for 6,500, which he had pawned
                weeks earlier for money to buy food. The victimized man's very
                job and survival were dependent on this simple form of transportation.
                The anguished, panic-stricken father and his son Bruno Ricci
                (Enzo Staiola) searched for the bike for a full week, but couldn't
                locate it, and the police wouldn't help them. Along the way,
                Antonio encountered injustice and apathy. From beginning to end,
                his small but fierce son Bruno was his companion, with whom he
                learned what real desperation could be. Feeling defeated, the
                father stole another bicycle but was immediately apprehended
                and humiliated in front of his son, although he was released.

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Big Clock (1948)</b>, 95 minutes, D: John Farrow<br />
          Director John Farrow's film noirish suspenseful thriller was later
              updated as the spy thriller <i>No Way Out (1987)</i> with Kevin
              Costner. In the opening scene, 1940's New York City media executive and <i>Crimeways</i> weekly
              magazine journalist-editor George Stroud (Ray Milland) was hiding
              inside his company's gigantic $600,000 privately-owned corporate
              clock in the Janoth Publications building's lobby (which synchronized
              with all other clocks in the entire building and in secondary printing
              plants and dozens of other foreign bureaus). The editor-in-chief
              found himself in a symbolic race against time to clear his own
            name (as he narrated what had happened to him). Married
            man Stroud was in the midst of planning to go on a long-postponed
            honeymoon trip to  Wheeling, WV with his wife Georgette (Maureen
            O'Sullivan) and son, but found himself keeping late company in a
            bar with blonde Pauline York (Rita Johnson), the mistress of his clock-obsessed,
            ruthless and detestable homosexual boss Earl Janoth (Charles Laughton),
            the powerful publishing tycoon of NYC's <i>Crimeways Magazine</i>;  he
            and Pauline (who was extorting money from Janoth) discussed how she
            might blackmail Janoth. They also bought a sundial and an abstract
            painting in an art shop during their evening together. This
            prelude led to a flashback 36 hours earlier when Stroud was implicated
            in the murder of Pauline. Both Stroud and Pauline were drunk when
             they returned to Pauline's apartment late that night. Before
          entering Pauline's apartment and killing her, Janoth noticed someone
          else who had just left Pauline's apartment just as he arrived, but
          did not see the man's face. Janoth pressured Pauline to identify
          her presumed other lover - she elusively claimed that the man's name
            was &quot;Jefferson Randolph&quot; to protect Stroud. The jealous Janoth
            killed Pauline after accusing her of having another lover - she snapped
            back that he was a &quot;cheap imitation Napoleon&quot; and called
            him &quot;disgusting...flabby.&quot; He struck her in the head with 
			the phallic-shaped, heavy metal sundial - and there was a contorted 
			closeup of Janoth's grotesque face with
            a twitching upper lip. To cover up his crime, Janoth cleverly planned
          to blame the murder on the other man. Janoth confessed his crime to
            his right-hand man Steve Hagen (George Macready), and had him cover
            up all evidence of the murder (including setting Pauline's
            clock - broken at the time of her death - ahead one hour), to frame the other man for the killing.
			 The bulk of the film was the ensuing cat-and-mouse game by Stroud who
            was enlisted by Janoth to investigate the case and find the killer
            (who was witnessed accompanying Pauline during the evening by many
            individuals). Stroud feared that his investigation would lead to
            only one man - himself! He realized that all the clues pointed to
            himself as the prime suspect, so he desperately attempted to steer
            the manhunt away from himself, and find information to incriminate
             Janoth by using a method of &quot;irrelevant clues.&quot; At
          the film's end in a taut confrontational scene, the framed Stroud accused
           Steve Hagen  of being the killer in order to smoke out Janoth - causing a raging Janoth to
          shoot Hagen (after he confessed: &quot;Janoth
          killed Pauline&quot;). Then, Janoth fell to
          his death down his building's empty elevator shaft during his attempted
        escape.</font></p>        </td>

              Walters<br />
              This memorable and happy MGM film, a perennial holiday favorite,
              was an Academy Award winner for Best Musical Score, with a number
              of classic songs and dance sequences - and a <i>Pygmalion</i>-plot
              involving many romantic complications. It was set in 1912, with
              a storyline about how vaudeville dancer Don Hewes (an older Fred
              Astaire, coming out of retirement, and a replacement for injured
              Gene Kelly) promised to turn an aspiring, naive chorus-girl protege
              Hannah Brown (Judy Garland), a bar waitress, into a star. He had
              recently been dropped by his long-time tap-dancing partner Nadine
              Hale (Ann Miller, replacing Cyd Charisse) (and romantic interest)
              who decided to go solo on Broadway in a Ziegfeld Follies show (the <i>Follies
              of 1912</i>). Though Don regretted the loss of Nadine,  
               he sought jealous revenge against her. Hannah worked hard to capture
              Don's approval - and his heart. At the same time, Nadine was aggressively
              pursuing Don's best friend Jonathan Harrow III (Peter Lawford),
              who was showing more interest in Hannah, while she was silently
              pining for Don. This was Astaire's and Garland's first and only
              teaming together, and producer Arthur Freed's fifth collaboration
              with composer Irving Berlin. It was filled with seventeen Irving
              Berlin songs, including the dance number <i>It Only Happens
              When I Dance With You</i> between Astaire and partner Ann Miller
              in a hotel suite, Miller's flashy and strong song/dance rendition
              of <i>Shakin'
              the Blues Away</i>, Astaire's slow-motion version of <i>Steppin'
              Out With My Baby</i>,
              the gleeful Astaire/Garland comic show-stopping duet <i>(We're)
              A Couple of Swells</i>          while
              dressed as lovable tramps, the opening rendition of <i>Happy
              Easter</i>,
          Astaire's creative dance sequence <i>Drum Crazy</i> in a toy store,
          the marvelous vaudeville montage sequence with Astaire and Garland
          entitled <i>When
              That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam</i>,
              and the closing performance of the title number <i>Easter Parade,
              </i>staged as a Fifth Avenue parade. </font></p></td>

              Polonsky<br />
              Co-writer/director
              Abraham Polonsky's first directed film  as a screenwriter was based
              on Ira Wolfert's novel <i>Tucker's People</i>. It was  
              an expressionistic, politically-subversive and dark work, and 
               an uncompromising post-war film noir that was narrated and told
              in documentary style. It was one of the few Hollywood films at
              the time with a devastating critique of capitalism. [Note: Shortly
              later, Polonsky was blacklisted for being an uncooperative witness
              before HUAC in 1951, and didn't direct any more feature films for
              almost 21 years.] The cynical gangster crime film about corruption
              and attempted redemption revolved around young, successful, corrupt
              Wall Street mob attorney Joe Morse (John Garfield in probably his
              finest role). In his opening voice-over (during a high-angle camera
              view of towering monolothic skyscrapers surrounding and overwhelming
              Trinity Church near Wall Street), he spoke: &quot;This
              is Wall Street and today was important because tomorrow, July Fourth,
              I intended to make my first million dollars, an exciting day in
              any man's life. Temporarily, the enterprise was slightly illegal.
              You see, I was the lawyer for the numbers racket....The suckers
              bet on any combination of three numbers, selected from the totals
              bet at some racetrack that day. Twenty million bettors a day in
              the United States - annual income of cheap crooks and racketeers
              over $100,000,000 dollars. It seemed a shame so much good money
              to go to waste in other people's pockets.&quot; Due to corrupt
              dealings with numbers racketeer-client and slimy crime boss Ben
              Tucker (Roy Roberts) who wanted to control the numbers racket,
              Morse was on the verge of easy money - making millions through
              a race-track betting scam-fix so that
          the winning lottery number on July 4th would be 776. Because so many
              superstitious bettors would make that bet, it would cause the many
              small numbers banks to go bankrupt and allow crooked Tucker to
              emerge as the city's #1 racketeer. Citywide, racketeers were up
              against Link Hall (Arthur O'Connell), the city's new special prosecutor,
              who was on a crusade to eliminate numbers runners, and was tapping
              telephones. However, as a self-proclaimed lawyer for the numbers
              racket, Joe was interested in becoming wealthy by making the racketeering
              legal for his Tucker Enterprises, Inc. client: &quot;We've got
              a big retainer to change the numbers racket into a legal lottery.&quot; In
              this Cain and Abel tale, Joe's honest, kindly yet estranged and
              stubborn older brother Leo Morse (Thomas Gomez) with a weak heart
              remained in the Lower East Side slum neighborhood where they had
              grown up, maintaining a local &quot;small
              numbers bank,&quot; and refusing to join the corrupt dealings of
              his younger brother. Leo accused Joe of blackmail and refused a
              proposed alliance deal: (&quot;I'll give you my answer,
              calmly and sensibly. My final answer. My final answer is finally
              No. The answer is No. Absolutely and finally No. Finally and positively
              No. No! No! No! N - O!&quot;).  At the same time, Joe was
              maintaining a romance with Leo's secretary-bookkeeper, working-class
              girl Doris Lowry (Beatrice Pearson), who was attracted to his fast,
              exciting and slick life-style. On July 4th as predicted, bankruptcy
              struck all the small numbers banks in the city, including Leo's
              business, and he was reluctantly forced by Joe to ally himself
              with Tucker's operation. However, Leo's meek frightened bookkeeper
              Freddy Bauer (Howland Chamberlin) refused and threatened to divulge
              the location of Leo's newly-reorganized and overtaken mob bank
              to special prosecutor Link Hall. Mob boss Tucker's sultry <i>femme
          fatale</i> wife Edna (Marie Windsor) was working behind-the-scenes
          to manipulate and torment Joe, delivering &quot;bad news&quot; about
          the possibility of wire-tapping by the special prosecutor, while she
          belittled his manhood. Fearing her strong-armed husband,
            Joe preferred to stay alive rather than give in to his partner's
            seductive wife, so he summarily dismissed her. Afterwards, he discovered
            his own desk phone was wire-tapped when he heard a &quot;little click.&quot; As
            the film progressed, Joe slowly began to realize that the law was
            closing in on him. He also knew he had become indebted to the syndicated
            mob for life and was one of its corrupted victims, as he took a walk
            in a deserted Wall Street (amidst towering buildings). Shortly later,
            he read newspaper headlines that Leo's bookkeeper Freddy Bauer had
            been killed and that Leo had been abducted (shortly later he died
            of a heart attack) by Tucker's ex-business rival Ficco (Paul Fix).
            In retaliation, Joe was able to seek vengeance on both Tucker and
            Ficco (who had joined forces together). After Ficco shot and killed
            Tucker, Joe killed Ficco. Toward the film's
          conclusion, Joe searched for the body of his estranged brother Leo
          - passing factories and a meat-packing area, ending with his running
          down a great stone staircase (&quot;I
          just kept going down and down there. It was like going down to the
          bottom of the world to find my brother&quot;) - almost a descent into
          hell - from Riverside Drive down to the rocks by the Hudson River lighthouse
          under the George Washington Bridge, where he found the dumped body
          of Leo. He described his descent in voice-over, and how he would now
          turn himself in to Link Hall. After finding Leo's body, Joe was determined
          to find justice for his brother by working with Link Hall to end corruption.
          He and Doris walked off, arm-in-arm, to an uncertain future.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Fort Apache (1948)</b>, 127 minutes, D: John Ford<br />
            This western was the first of John Ford's three-part cavalry stories,
                followed by <i>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)</i> and <i>Rio
                Grande (1950)</i>.
                RKO's picture (hurriedly completed in 3 weeks and $700K under
                budget) was set in the post-Civil War period at Fort Apache,
                an isolated cavalry post in Apache Territory in Arizona. It was
                considered a reworking of the Custer myth about the flawed military
                character. In the plot, veteran  Captain Kirby York (John Wayne)
                was stationed at the desolate Fort Apache, who soon found himself
                at odds with arrogant, stuffy, Indian-hating, racist lieutenant
                Lt. Col. Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda). Thursday was the new replacement
                commander for both York and Capt. Sam Collingwood (George O'Brien).
                He was accompanied by his teenaged daughter Philadelphia or &quot;Phil&quot;
                (Shirley Temple in one of her first adult roles). A minor distracting
                sublot concerned a romance between Philadelphia and 2nd Lt. Michael
                &quot;Mickey&quot; O'Rourke (John Agar), the son of Fort Apache non-commissioned
                veteran Sgt. Michael O'Rourke (Ward Bond). As a disgruntled widower
                who resented being demoted after the Civil War and transferred
                to the West, the stubborn and by-the-book Lt. Thursday was ignorant and prejudicial about the local Native-Americans. Trouble
                began to brew due to the dealings of dishonest and contemptible
                Indian agent Silas Meacham (Grant Withers), who was taking advantage
                of the Apaches by giving them low-quality food and cheap &quot;rotgut&quot; alcohol,
                and selling Winchester 7-shot repeater guns to them to instigate
                hostilities. The
          honorable, clever and elusive Apache chief Cochise (Miguel Inclan)
          explained to York why they had left the reservation after a few years
          and had fled across the Rio Grande to Mexico - it was because of the
           politically-corrupt Meacham, who cheated them: &quot;Whiskey, but
           no beef. Trinkets instead of blankets. The women degraded, the children
          sickly, and the men turning into drunken animals.&quot; Captain
            York negotiated in good faith and trust with Cochise to cross back
            over the border from Mexico to &quot;American soil&quot; and peacefully
          return to the reservation - after Meacham was permanently removed.
            However, Thursday  refused
          York's and Cochise's deal, and ordered
              the regiment to prepare at dawn for a major battle. Thursday also
              demeaned Cochise as &quot;a breechclouted savage... an illiterate,
          uncivilized murderer and treaty-breaker.&quot; The commander attempted to
          destroy the overwhelming forces of the Apache nation and force them
            to return to the reservation. He foolishly
          endorsed and participated in a suicidal Army attack (symbolic of blundering &quot;Custer's
            Last Stand&quot;), and heroically fought and died with his regiment
            during the lethal and unnecessary skirmish. A few years later, &quot;Thursday's
            Charge&quot; was fictionally trumped up as heroic and courageous
            by the Eastern press, with York (who had assumed command of Fort
            Apache) loyally assenting to the glorified account of the battle
            and defending Thursday (&quot;No man died more gallantly, nor won
            more honor for his regiment&quot;), even though he knew that Thursday's
            praised actions and character were overblown. He had more admiration
            for the hard-bitten life and dedication of the cavalrymen in the
            regiment. Lt. O'Rourke - who was married to Philadelphia Thursday
            (with a son), was serving as York's adjutant. </font></p>

              Olivier<br />
              Director/star Laurence Olivier's sweeping, well-paced and dramatic
              adaptation of the classic tale was the first version of the play
              during the sound-talkie era. It was the Best Picture Academy Award-winner
              - and the first British (or non-American) film to win the top honor.
              It also marked the first time a director had  directed himself
               to a Best Actor Oscar. It was memorably remade as Kenneth Branagh's <i>Hamlet
              (1996)</i>. This was the second of three Shakepeare adaptations made by Olivier
              -- after <i>Henry V (1944)</i>, and before <i>Richard III (1955)</i>.
              The expressionistic, shadowy, black and white film opened with
              some lines from Shakespeare's play and then Olivier's explanatory
              voice-over: &quot;This is the tragedy of a man who could not make
              up his mind.&quot; Shakespeare's tale (although abbreviated or streamlined, with the excision of
              the characters of Fortinbras, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) was
              about a disconsolate and mad Danish prince (Best Actor-winning
              Olivier) who agonized over his moral responsibilities to his murdered
              father, his subjects, and his loved ones. In haunted Elsinore Castle
              (filmed within huge sets), the irresolute and brooding Hamlet sought
              an elaborate revenge for the secret and suspicious murder (an accidental
              snakebite -- &quot;murder most foul&quot;) of his father King Hamlet
              by his own treacherous uncle, the new King Claudius (Basil Sydney),
              who hastily married Hamlet's mother Queen Gertrude (Eileen Herlie).
              Hamlet also became involved with Ophelia (Jean Simmons) in a tragic
              and rejected love affair (&quot;Get thee to a nunnery&quot;). 
			  She became suicidal after Hamlet's accidental
              murder of her own father Polonius (Felix Aylmer). Hamlet's most
              famous soliloquy &quot;To be or not to be&quot; defined his conflicted and depressed
              psychological state of mind. In the brutal, death-filled ending,
              all of the major characters expired. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: George Stevens<br />
George Stevens' and RKO's sentimental and nostalgic post-war favorite, with DeWitt
Bodeen's screenplay loosely based on Kathryn Forbes'
book <i>Mama's Bank Account</i> - received five Oscar nominations (remarkably, four
were for acting roles). The big-budget revered family
classic was also based on the original 1944 Broadway
play written by John Van Druten and produced by Rodgers and Hammerstein. The
film's success led to a popular Lux Radio Theatre show in 1948,  the  best-loved
early CBS-TV sitcom titled <i>Mama</i> (from 1949-1957) with
Peggy Wood as Mama,  an &quot;ITV Play of the Week&quot; in 1961, and a Broadway
musical stage show in 1979. The story, a series of vignettes, was about a middle-class
Norwegian immigrant family living on Larkin Street in San Francisco at the turn
of the century (around 1910). The family was held together by a stern, resourceful,
untiring, protective and loving matriarch, Marta &quot;Mama&quot; Hanson
(Irene Dunne at age 50), and her blustering, hard-working carpenter husband Lars &quot;Papa&quot; Hanson
(Philip Dorn). They had four growing children (only one boy): the eldest boy
Nels (Steve Brown), aspiring writer Katrin (or Katherine) (Barbara Bel Geddes),
Christine (Peggy McIntyre) and Dagmar (June Hedin). Family life was recalled
in flashback style from the diary of the oldest daughter Katrin [Note: the &quot;I&quot; in
the film's title referred to Katrin], as she narrated and read from her recently-written
autobiographical novel. Katrin had just finished it, typing the words THE END.
She stretched back and then took the many pages in her hands, and began reading
from its start. The famous quote (voice-over): &quot;But
first and foremost, I remember Mama&quot; (the
conclusion of the book's introduction) was heard. As
          Katrin lovingly remembered, Mama struggled daily with the finances
to seek a new and better life for the family members, living in an unfamiliar
          land. One early incident  included
          preparing the weekly financial budget (with Mama's familiar relief: &quot;Is
          good - we do not have to go to the bank&quot;). When Nels expressed
          an interest to go to high school, the other family members sacrificed
          or volunteered to help. The family was surrounded by a colorful procession
              of relatives (e.g., Mama's bullying, overbearing and boisterous
              older brother Uncle Chris Halverson (Oskar Homolka) - a ranch owner
              in Ukiah who was partnered with his long-time quiet common-law
              wife Jessie Brown (Barbara O'Neil), and Mama's sister - timid
              spinster fiancee Trina (Ellen Corby) who had plans to marry homely
              undertaker Peter Thorkelson (Edgar Bergen)), boarders (especially
              impoverished Mr. Jonathan Hyde (Cedric Hardwicke)) and other friends.
              Memorable episodes included Dagmar's surgical operation (for removal
              of a mastoid), Mama's clever stealth to enter the hospital's off-limits
              ward to visit her, the sickness of the household's cat Uncle Elizabeth,
          the death of Uncle Chris, and Mama's encouragement of Katrin to aspire
          to be a writer. The ending revealed that Mama had deceptively fibbed
          to the family about having a bank account. </font></p>          </td>

        Negulesco </font><br />
          <font size="2">Director Jean Negulesco's  emotionally-charged psychological
          and social melodrama featured sensitive acting and a Max Steiner score.
          It was based on the 1940 stage hit play by Elmer Blaney Harris (which
          was based on a real-life incident), and was remarkable as  the first
          Hollywood film to address the problem of rape (previously the controversial
          subject was banned). It received twelve Academy Award nominations and
          only one win. It was remade as a TV movie in 1967 and 1982 with Mia
          Farrow and Rosanna Arquette respectively. Hearing-impaired/mute Belinda
          MacDonald (Best Actress-winning Jane Wyman) lived on a farm with her
          bullish father Black (Charles Bickford) and Aunt Aggie (Agnes Moorehead)
          in a small Nova Scotia fishing town on Cape Breton Island in the post-war
          period. Belinda, known as &quot;The
          Dummy,&quot; was befriended by kindly, compassionate and patient local country doctor
          Dr. Robert Richardson (Lew Ayres) who taught her to read lips and sign
          language. In one scene, she sensed something of what music must be
          and tried to dance when her hand was placed upon a vibrating violin.
          One night, she experienced the shadowy rape-attack of drunk villager
          Locky McCormick (Stephen McNally) - the scene quickly faded to black,
          and soon after, she found herself pregnant. Everyone thought that the
          doctor was the father and he was disgraced. Belinda's father, who learned
          of the rapist's identity, was murdered at cliff's edge by him. Belinda
          silently recited the Lord's Prayer in sign language at the bedside
          of her dead father. When the rapist tried to claim the baby from her
          in a violent scene, she shot-gunned him to death. Subsequently, she
          was put on trial and defended by an attorney (Alan Napier), when Locky's
          jealous wife Stella (Jan Sterling), who wanted the baby, made an accusatory
          outburst against her dead husband: &quot;It
        was him, Locky. He's the baby's father. It was his fault!&quot; Belinda
        was acquitted because it was ruled that she was protecting her baby. </font></p>        </td>

            Director John Huston's  entertaining gangster crime-melodrama was
                adapted from Maxwell Anderson's stage play by both director Huston
                and Richard Brooks. The plot resembled Bogart's earlier film <em>The
                Petrified Forest (1936)</em> about a hostage situation. It was
                an intelligent, exciting, theatrical, but moody, downbeat crime
                drama/thriller (and melodramatic film noir). Bogart and Bacall
                would never star together again on the big screen (this was their
                fourth and final film), after having previously worked together
                in the classic films: <i><a href="toha.html">To Have and Have
                Not (1942)</a></i> (which <i>Key Largo</i> resembled in its dark tone), <i><a href="bigs.html">The
                Big Sleep (1946)</a></i> and <i>Dark Passage (1947)</i>. It told about a bullying, fugitive gangster
                Johnny Rocco (Edgar G. Robinson in a trademark role), who was
                first seen sweating profusely in a bathtub with a rotating fan,
                a cigar and an iced drink. He was on-the-run with fellow gang
                mobsters and his alcoholic lush moll and ex-nightclub singer,
                Gaye Dawn (Oscar-winning Claire Trevor). In the film's most memorable
                scene, moll Gaye desperately sang &quot;Moanin' Low&quot; to
                hopefully earn a drink from Rocco. In a Florida Keys hotel in
                the off-season during a violent, tropical hurricane, the snarling
                Rocco waited for a counterfeit money deal as he prepared to flee
                back to Cuba. Meanwhile, he held the various hotel residents
                hostage, including Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart), a disillusioned,
                returning war-scarred veteran who was visiting the newly-widowed
                Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and her wheelchair-bound father-in-law,
                hotel manager James Temple (Lionel Barrymore). Nora's late husband
                George (and James' son) had died under McCloud's WWII command
                in Italy. During a final confrontation on a small fishing boat
                returning to Cuba, when a wounded Frank had finally had enough
                of the escaping gang, he overtook them - and killed Rocco with
                three shots before alerting the authorities. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Orson Welles<br />
            Welles' imaginative, complicated, unsettling <em>film noir</em> who-dun-it
            thriller  was a B/W tale of betrayal, lust, greed and murder. It
            featured fascinating visuals and tilting compositions, luminous and
            brilliant camerawork (by Charles Lawton, Jr.), and numerous sub-plots
            and confounding plot twists. Orson Welles served as director, producer,
            screenplay writer, and actor, and based his screenplay upon Sherwood
            King's 1938 novel <em>If I Die Before I Wake</em>. The moody film,
            originally titled <em>Take This Woman</em> and then <em>Black Irish</em>,
            was made when major stars Orson Welles and sexy Rita Hayworth (with
            dyed and bobbed bleached-blonde hair) - in her last film under contract
            to Columbia Pictures) - were still married although estranged and
            drifting apart. [Note: The numerous close-ups of Rita Hayworth in the film were later
            added by Welles in Hollywood upon orders of the studio, to lend strength
            to her 'star' power.] Ultimately, the film's length was severely
            cut down by one hour, creating an almost incomprehensible, discontinuous,
            cryptic patchwork from numerous retakes and substantial edits. Although
            it was filmed in late 1946 and finished in early 1947, it wasn't
            released until late in 1948. The film was mostly ignored - it failed
            both at the box-office and as a critical success. In the plot, poor
            Irish seaman Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) rescued Mrs. Elsa 'Rosalie'
            Bannister (Rita Hayworth) and soon became mesmerized by her. She
            was the enigmatic wife of a crippled San Francisco trial lawyer named
            Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane). O'Hara  joined her yachting cruise
            as a working crew member from New York to San Francisco (via the
            Panama Canal). He soon found himself embroiled in a love affair and
            a mysterious plot (to kill Bannister's creepy business partner George
            Grisby (Glenn Anders)) - the plot eventually turned deadly and implicated
            him in murder. The film, told through O'Hara's narration, was shot
            on locations including Acapulco, San Francisco, and at Columbia Studios
            sets, and featured numerous classic set-pieces including: the aquarium
            scene, and the funhouse and Hall of Mirrors shoot-out climax (shot
            in San Francisco's Playland). </font></p></td>

                  (1948)</a>,</b> 87 minutes, D: Max Ophuls<br />
            German director Max Ophuls' most successful Hollywood film (adapted
            from Stefan Zweig's 1922 novella) was this  quintessential &quot;women's
            film.&quot; The emotionally-complex, bittersweet, old-fashioned tearjerker romance
            was conveyed via a series of flashbacks. Both protagonists faced
            an inextricable impasse and experienced numerous missed opportunities
            over a span of twenty years - and ultimately failed to attain true
            romance. The lush and haunting film told about Lisa Berndl (Joan
            Fontaine), a beautiful young woman with a childhood crush and doomed
            love for a charmingly suave, philandering concert pianist Stefan
            Brand (Louis Jourdan) in 19th century Vienna. The night before the
            cavalier, callow and self-absorbed pianist was due to fight a dawn
            duel for offending a lady's honor with Lisa's wealthy husband Johann
            Stauffer (Marcel Journet), he received a letter from a strange, unknown
            woman - the key to his continual self-destruction and downfall. He
            was, in fact, planning to avoid the duel and have his mute valet-servant
            John (Art Smith) pack his bags. Through the deathbed letter, he learned
            for the first time about the young teenaged girl, his next-door neighbor
            in his apartment building, and her undying love that she felt for
            him through the years during other encounters. Their acquaintance
            included a pregnancy and son Stefan Jr. (Leo B. Pessin) - although
            he continually failed to recognize her at each new meeting. During
            the nighttime reading of the letter, Stefan looked at photos of his
            son and learned that Lisa was married, but then the son that he fathered
            with her had died of typhus - and 27 year old Lisa had also died
            of the same disease (&quot;By the time you read this letter, I may
            be dead&quot;). Resolute after remembering her, finally, Stefan  decided
            to confront Lisa's husband in a fateful duel.</font></p></td>

        This was documentarian Robert Flaherty's last  film, produced (and financed)
            by Standard Oil Company with a budget of approximately $250K. It
            had a Pulitzer Prize-winning original score by composer Virgil Thomson.
            The documentary (with faux authenticity)
            depicted the growing, devastating effects of the oil industry on
            the Louisiana bayou country, although naive director Flaherty's underdeveloped,
            poorly-acted film contained no explicit commentary on the ecological
            effects or the significant cultural transition about to take place.
            A young Cajun boy named Alexander Napolean Ulysses Latour (Joseph
            Boudreaux), who lived in the marshlands of Petit Anse Bayou, watched
            as off-shore platforms were built and oil riggers-drillers worked,
            after his trapper father (Lionel Le Blanc) signed a lease agreement
            with an oil company. His simple, nature-loving, idyllic, and peaceful
            way of life (hunting, fishing, tussling with alligators) with a pet
            raccoon as he explored and canoed through the bayous, would soon
            change forever. The fascinated, adventurous, and daydreaming Cajun
            boy regularly visited with the friendly Driller (Frank Hardy) and
            the Boilerman (C. P. Guedry). One day with their monstrous, towering
            steam-driven oil derrick, the drillers struck oil with a money-making
            geyser that was soon capped with a Christmas tree - readied for future
            pumping.</font></p></td>

        Director Frank Borzage's and Republic Pictures' film-noirish crime melodrama,
            the director's last great film, was based on Theodore Strauss' 1946
            best-selling novel (that was first serialized in two issues of <i>Cosmopolitan
            Magazine </i> in mid-1946). Its themes of tortured psychic depression,
            gloomy melancholy, and murder set the tone for the very complex psychological
            drama. The film's brilliant opening montage of wordless
              visual story-telling was set in the small
            Virginia town of Woodville. At the public hanging
            of an accused Virginia killer, Jeb Hawkins, the convicted murderer
            (for shooting and killing an incompetent doctor who had indirectly
            caused his wife to die by not making a house call but offering only
            a bottle of pills - the wrong tablets) was expressionistically marched
            to the gallows in a rainy downpour. The image
            was paired with the view of a crying baby - the man's
              child had a shadow of a dangling play-doll dangling by a string
            above its crib, casting a transposed
            duplicate of the hanging man  onto its blanket, to
            convey the belief that &quot;bad
            blood&quot; was being transmitted from one generation to the next.
            The montage continued with the sad and mistreated childhood of outcast
            Danny Hawkins (Johnny Calkins as 13 year old), who often fought on
            the school playground against his teasing, taunting and tormenting
            schoolmate Jerry Sykes (Michael Dill as 13 year old), who chanted
            with others their prejudiced view of Danny because of his father: &quot;Danny
            Hawkins' dad was hanged!&quot; The
        next sequence was  an altercation outside a dance hall,
            where adult Danny Hawkins (Dane Clark as adult) argued with rich
            banker's son Jerry Sykes (Lloyd Bridges as adult), his lifelong tormentor,
            over their mutual love of warm-hearted, local schoolteacher Gilly
        Johnson (Gail Russell). Unbeknownst to Danny, Gilly was the fiancee of
        the teasing, arrogant, and bullying Sykes. The
            next shot was a pair of legs (Danny's)  walking near a swamp (called
              Brother's Pond) to meet with Jerry Sykes, to engage in a bloody
        and vicious fist-fight. In a drunken rage, Hawkins grabbed a rock that
              Sykes had picked up and repeatedly smashed his skull with it -
              murdering him in self-defense. He would soon suffer the same fate
              as his father - pursued for a crime. He left an important clue
              behind - his pocket-knife dangling in a tree. An investigation
              followed with a frenzied manhunt for the killer. After the murder,
              Danny danced with Gilly (she asked:
          &quot;What's come over you?...I'm a schoolteacher, I can't afford to
          fight with you in front of other people&quot;), and then during a night
          drive with her from the dance, Danny experienced a near-fatal car crash
        when he had a vision of Sykes fighting with him. After
        developing a strange friendship between each other, within a ruined Southern
        mansion (Blackwater Mansion), Hawkins surreptitiously met Gilly, and
        in the midst of their burgeoning love affair, Gilly imagined that they
        were attending a romanticized Civil War era ball in the house when she
        adopted an exaggerated Southern accent as the plantation's owner Mrs.
        Blackwater - they waltzed together and spoke of their mutual love before
        they kissed - and the film faded to black. Danny feared being discovered
        for the crime, and nearly-strangled harmless, mentally-handicapped mute
        Billy Scripture (Harry Morgan) who found Danny's knife. Once Sykes' body
        was found after only a few days, Danny was even more fearful of being
        caught. In a pivotal  scene at a county fair,  panicking Danny (with
        Gilly) - fearing being caught while sharing a ferris-wheel ride with
        the town's Sheriff Clem Otis (Allyn Joslyn), caused him to jump, and
        increased further suspicions. During pursuit by the Sheriff (and his
        dogs), Danny  ventured into the swamp to the backwoods home of
        his wise Grandma (Ethel Barrymore); she helped him to reflect on his
        past when she told him that his father's act of
        murder was uncharacteristic of him. Danny realized that he should control
        his fate and turn himself in for manslaughter - to free himself from
        guilt and his past and his feelings about having &quot;bad blood.&quot; He
        stood at his father's grave, reflected about his past, and spoke to him:
          &quot;I ain't proud of what ya done, Pa. All the same, I didn't mean
          what I said last night. You did the best you could to even things up.
        That's what I'm doin' now. Maybe we'll both have some peace.&quot; In
        the final scene, he approached the Sheriff to peacefully
         surrender. He reunited with Gilly and hugged her as she assured him: &quot;It&rsquo;s
         wonderful to see your face, Daniel. To really see it.&quot; The optimistic
         scene was flooded with bright light as Danny freed himself of his guilt
         and self-hatred. The Sheriff refused to have Danny handcuffed: &quot;Let
         him walk back like a man&quot;
         as they returned to town. </font></p>        </td>

        Dassin<br />
        Director Jules Dassin's hard-boiled urban docu-drama crime/noir
        film about a police murder investigation was a great semi-documentary
        film from Universal. It was the first studio feature shot on location in New York City. It featured  raw energy
        and Oscar-winning cinematography by William Daniels. It
        was the film that inspired the 50's ABC-TV series - with its famed ending
        quote delivered as an epitaph for the murdered woman: &quot;There
            Are EIGHT MILLION Stories In The Naked City - This Has Been ONE Of
        Them.&quot; The grim, fact-based story opened with aerial views of New York
          City (no title screen!) - accompanied by credits narration from the
          film's producer, tabloid journalist Mark Hellinger (who conducted six
          months of interviews with the NYPD to gather accurate details and characterizations)
          - Hellinger was also the voice of the final quote. Then, it gave an
          account of the brutal robbery-murder of attractive, and promiscuous
          26 year-old blonde fashion model Jean Dexter in her NYC apartment's
          bathtub (was it a suicide?), and the subsequent manhunt for the killer
          by homicide detectives, involving veteran cop Det. Lt. Dan Muldoon
          (Barry Fitzgerald) and younger partner Det. Jimmy Halloran (Don Taylor).
          In an emotional sequence at the City Morgue, Jean's estranged parents
          - the Batorys (Adelaide Klein and Grover Burgess), identified her body.
          One of the prime suspects was Jean's fast-living boyfriend, deceitful
          Frank Niles (Howard Duff), although he had an alibi.  In
          the film's  memorable, thrilling, and heart-pounding climax, ex-con
          murder suspect Willie Garzah (aka Willie the Harmonica) (Ted de Corsia)
          ran through the Lower East Side tenements until being cornered on the
          Williamsburg Bridge, where he climbed to the top of the bridge tower.
          He refused to surrender, was shot a few times, and fell to his death.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Oliver Twist (1948, UK)</strong>, 116 minutes,
              D: David Lean<br />
              David Lean directed this dark, expressionistic and shadowy British
              production (with beautiful cinematography by Guy Green) after the
              success of his earlier Dickens' hit <i>Great
              Expectations (1946)</i>. This was an excellent and straight-forward screen portrayal of
              the classic 1839 Charles Dickens story of the title character among
              the downtrodden and abused classes of 19th-century England. It
              was  a remake of the first film version of the tale by Poverty
              Row's Monogram studios in 1933, with Dickie Moore in the lead role.
              It was also remade as a colorful Best Picture-winning musical, <i>Oliver!
              (1968)</i> by Columbia Pictures - an adaptation of the Broadway
              hit. This film's opening was delayed in the US until 1951 due to
              protesting Jewish groups that claimed it was anti-Semitic, and
              some scenes were initially censored. In the powerful first scene,
              the title character's exhausted Mother (Josephine Stuart), in labor,
              staggered over the moors and gave birth, before dying, at a work
              house. Orphan boy Oliver Twist (John Howard Davies) lived at the
              parish work house where he was systematically abused by the callous
              officials led by Mr. Bumble (Francis L. Sullivan). When 9 year-old
              Oliver brazenly asked for more porridge-gruel (&quot;Please sir,
              I want some more"), his punishment by the harsh authorities was severe, and he soon
              after escaped from the institution and ran away to London. A company
              of thieves, including pickpocket the Artful Dodger (Anthony Newley),
              the hideous, unsavory, hook-nosed rogue Fagin (Alec Guinness),
              &quot;the Jew,&quot; and the murderously evil Bill Sykes (Robert
              Newton) with his prostitute girlfriend Nancy (Kay Walsh), recruited
              the innocent into a life of petty street crime. After the demise
              or arrest of most of the gang, Oliver was  rescued and taken in
              by kindly gentleman and benefactor Mr. Brownlow (Henry Stephenson),
              who was revealed to be Oliver's actual grandfather. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Paleface (1948)</strong>, 91 minutes,
              D: Norman Z. McLeod<br />
              Director Norman McLeod's early Technicolored spoof of western films
              (it was the highest grossing Western spoof until <i><a href="blaz.html">Blazing
              Saddles (1974)</a></i>) - was one of Bob Hope's biggest box-office hits, with lots of one-liners,
              slapstick, and wisecracks. It was noted for having Bob Hope's musical
              rendering of &quot;Buttons and Bows,&quot;
            the Academy Award Oscar-winner for Best Song. Scriptwriter Frank
              Tashlin fashioned it as a satirical version of Owen Wister's novel <i>The
              Virginian</i>. It was followed by the sequel, <i>Son
              of Paleface (1952)</i> (again with scriptwriter Tashlin now as
              the director, and the two main stars), and a remake <i>The
              Shakiest Gun in the West (1968) </i>with quirky comedian Don Knotts.
             In the plot,  bumbling and inept frontier dentist Peter &quot;Painless&quot; Potter (Bob
            Hope) had  learned his trade through a correspondence school. The
             quack dentist became acquainted with the pistol-wielding, big-breasted
             Calamity Jane (Jane Russell). The female outlaw had been released
             from prison in exchange for becoming an undercover government
             agent working with Governor Johnson (Charles Trowbridge) on a case
             involving the smuggling of guns to the Indians. On her way to Fort
             Deerfield to meet up with her secret agent male partner who would
             be posing as her fake pioneering husband and lawyer Jim Hunter, she learned that he had
             been killed. The cowardly and nerdy
            dentist Potter was recruited to take his place and marry sharp-shooting
             Calamity Jane to continue her innocent cover. Her goal was to dupe
             the outlaws into thinking that Potter was a federal agent so that
             she could catch the outlaws and receive a pardon for a 10-year prison
             sentence. [Note: The gun-running renegades were later revealed to
             be Toby Preston (Bobby Watson), the owner of The Dirty Shame saloon
             Terris (Robert Armstrong), and Gov. Johnson's own traitorous-turncoat
             Indian Affairs chief Jasper Martin (Jack Searl).] (A running joke
             was Hope's many failed attempts to kiss co-star Jane Russell - he
             was repeatedly knocked out on the back of his head.) By
             film's end, Jane gave all the heroic credit to Potter for saving
             their wagon train from a war party of Indians who attacked their
             pioneer camp. Jane also saved Potter during a gun duel shootout
             and killed his opponent, jealous boyfriend Big Joe (Jeff York).
             However, Potter also earned merit by rescuing the two of them from
             being burned at the stake by scalp-hungry Indians, while disguised
             as a medicine man.  In the final scene, they
              exposed their true feelings for each other en route to a honeymoon.
              But then Jane was pulled from the wagon by one of the horses and
              dragged off into the distance, and Potter turned to the camera
            and quipped: &quot;What do you want, a happy ending?&quot; </font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Portrait of Jennie (1948)</b>, 86 minutes, D:      William Dieterle<br />
          Director William Dieterle's visually-rich, romantic fantasy was based
              upon Robert Nathan's 1940 novella. It was nominated for two Academy
              Awards (including Best Cinematography) and won for Best Special
              Effects. The plot was basically a soft-focus daydream. Beginning
              in the Depression-Era year of 1934, alienated, struggling and depressed
              artist Eben Adams (Joseph Cotten) (with sketches tucked under his
              arm) was in NYC's Central Park one morning where he first encountered
              enigmatic young schoolgirl Jennie Appleton (Jennifer Jones). She
              was strangely dressed in old-fashioned, turn-of-the-century clothes.
              It would be the first of many ambiguous encounters (with a different
              Jennie each time at different stages of her life as she grew older),
              emphasized by Jennie's song that she sang to herself: &quot;Where
              I come from nobody knows, And where I'm going, Everything goes.
              The wind blows, the sea flows. Where I come from, Nobody knows.&quot; [Note:
              The title song became a hit record for Nat King Cole.] His relationship
              with Jennie grew over time and began to change him and affect his
              way of life. He became more passionate and inspired in his paintings,
              as Jennie became his muse. He gradually learned that the traumatic
              events that Jennie was experiencing had occurred years earlier
              - and that he was communing with her &quot;ghost&quot; across time.
              He sought verification of the realities about Jennie's life, first
              at the location of an old music hall (where her parents had performed
              vaudeville in the past in 1910 at Hammerstein's Victoria). He learned
              that Jennie's parents had been killed one night when their high-wire
              broke during a performance. He continued to find clues to Jennie's
              later life at her convent school, where she was sent following
              her parents' deaths. (He ultimately learned from the Mother Superior,
              Mary of Mercy (Lillian Gish) that Jennie drowned in the 1920s 
               after her sailboat was lost in a tidal wave off Cape Cod.) As
              he fell in love with Jennie, he was inspired to paint an official
              portrait of her (that would require more than one sitting) and
              showed the artwork to art dealers Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore)
              and Matthews (Cecil Kellaway) who 
              were deeply impressed by his skill. When the portrait was finished,
              Jennie left him forever. In the film's finale, he followed her
              one last time to &quot;Land's End&quot; - the lighthouse on a rocky
              point on Cape Cod, where she had died. On the anniversary of her
              death date, October 5, he rented a boat and sailed out to the lighthouse
              during a storm - and there he was able to momentarily reunite his
              spirit with hers (Jennie vowed she would love him forever) before
              she was swept away by the tide in her small boat - it would be
              her final disappearance. Once the hurricane subsided, he was only
              left with symbols of her reality - her silk scarf and his portrait
              of her. The closing shot was of her portrait - now in striking
              3-strip Technicolor. The film asked the ultimate riddle - was Jennie
              really alive, or only imagined in Eben's memory? Their spiritual
              love would presumably endure eternally beyond death and they would
              always be together through the coming years through his art. </font> </p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Howard Hawks<br />
            Action director Howard Hawks' classic, tightly-structured 40s epic
            Western was one of the best American westerns ever made, with beautiful
            photography by Russell Harlan. This was one of producer/director
            Howard Hawks' most extravagant and ambitious films (and his first
            western), and it cost over $3 million (overbudget) at the time -
            an exorbitant sum, but became a top-grossing film of the year. It
            was a familiar tale of father/son rivalry and a battle of wills between
            the two opposites in a rebellion spanning a time period of fifteen
            years. In the film's opening set in 1851, Tom Dunson  (John Wayne
            in one of his best performances and his first film of five for Hawks)
            decided to leave a wagon train from St. Louis on its way to California,
            in order to set out on his own as a Texas rancher and cattle baron.
            He split up his loving sweetheart Fen (Coleen Gray) with plans to
            join together with her later. Shortly afterwards, Dunson was dismayed
            to learn that members of her wagon train had been massacred by Comanche
            Indians. With Dunson's side-kick Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan), the
            two came across a young orphaned boy (the wagon train's sole survivor)
            named Matt (Mickey Kuhn as young boy) wandering on the prairie with
            a lone cow, and it was decided that Tom would raise him as his foster
            son - and &quot;And that was the meeting of a boy with a cow and a man
            with a bull and the beginning of a great herd.&quot; The threesome soon
            claimed land north of the Rio Grande for a ranch known as &quot;Red River.&quot;
            A montage then shifted to almost fifteen years later to 1865, at
            which time Dunson's herd needed to be transported north to the market
            in Missouri. The western film chronicled
            the first monumental, historic cattle drive north along the Chisholm
            Trail to their rail-head destination in Abilene, Kansas, and authentically
            depicted an epic, bleak and tough journey, similar to the ones in
            The Odyssey or in Exodus (in the Old Testament), that was fraught
            with external dangers, threats, tests of strength, and internal contentious
            tensions. By this time, Tom's less harsh, surrogate,
            grown-up adopted son Matthew Garth (Montgomery Clift in his first
            film) had become a major strong-willed antagonist. He faced off against
            his hard-nosed, self-made, bitter, dictatorial, ruthless and tough commanding father.
            During the near-suicidal cattle drive, their
            vicious confrontations, capped by Dunson's tyrannical, unbearably
            harsh treatment of deserters, eventually led to a mutinous revolt
            - a western <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em> -
            when the cowpokes supported the natural leader - Matt.   Matt rescued
            a wagon train (of dance hall girls and gamblers) from an Apache Indian
            attack - and made the acquaintance of Tess Millay (Joanne
            Dru), one of the pioneer women - and established a romantic relationship
            with her. Dunson vowed to pursue and kill
            his son in a murderous quest that climaxed in an inevitable, brutal
            fist-fight and show-down. Their  final
            savage confrontation occurred at sun-up, when
            Dunson saw Matt in the distance in Abilene. Dunson
            dismounted and strode through the stray cows
            (actually plowed or waded through them like water in a river), and
            drew his gun on Matt - and challenged Matt.  When Matt refused
            to draw, they got into a lengthy, fist-fight brawl. The
            two men were reconciled when their argument was broken up by the
            tough woman in the film, Matt's girlfriend Tess, who stepped in and
            ended their final fight to the death with a gun. They obeyed her
            by ultimately reconciling after Tom told Matt that he should marry

              Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger <br />
            This beautiful and sensitive film came from the masterful directing/producing
            team of Powell and Pressburger. The dramatic masterpiece, filmed
            in breathtaking, gorgeous Technicolor, has often
            been considered the best ballet film ever made. The exquisite musical
            tragedy provided a realistic and close look at the backstage world
            of a ballerina as it pursued the theme of the choice between love/marriage
            and/or her artistic career. The tale was taken - metaphorically -
            from Hans Christian Andersen's tragic fairy tale of the same name,
            about a ballerina who wore an enchanted pair of magic, red ballerina
            slippers that couldn't be removed and forced her to never stop dancing
            - and she danced herself to death. The film was basically a love
            triangle-drama involving the three main characters (a female and
            two males). An ambitious and dedicated young, red-headed English
            prima ballerina Victoria &quot;Vicky&quot; Page
            (Moira Shearer) was made a star by her Svengali-like mentor impresario
            and producer-conductor Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) of the Lermontov
            Ballet Company. But she was soon torn between her struggling conductor-composer
            husband Julian Craster (Marius Goring) who could offer her nothing
            but his love, and the obsessed impresario who could further her dancing
            career with the ballet company. She painfully struggled with making
            a difficult choice between her career (the art of ballet) and love.
            Her desire to dance conflicted with her need for love - and ultimately
            led to her death. The film's magical highlight was a 15-minute stylized,
            imaginatively-filmed &quot;Red
            Shoes&quot; ballet
            blended and integrated seamlessly within the storyline about the
            characters. The film ended with Vicky's melodramatic tragic death
            scene when she was propelled to her death just before an encore concert
            presentation of <i>The Red Shoes</i> ballet. She had been persuaded
            by Lermontov to return to dance the ballet once again. Just before
            the performance, Julian arrived to demand that Vicky leave with him
            at once, although she was also commanded to remain by Lermontov.
            Vicky contended
              that her true desire was to dance and she chose to stay and dance
              and not leave with Julian. But then when she became hysterical,
            conflicted, and confused about what to do, the controlling red shoes
            willfilly took her down the steps of the Opera House to a balcony
            overlook and forcefully pulled her off (into the path of an oncoming
            train on the tracks below). She tragically died (was it an accident
            or suicide?), as did the girl in the ballet - paralleling real life
            with the ballet's plot. The scheduled ballet was performed as planned
            but without her (with a spotlight shining on the floor where she
            would have been dancing) after an announcement by Lermontov: &quot;Ladies
            and Gentlemen. I am sorry to tell you that Miss Page is unable to
            dance tonight, nor indeed... any other night. Nevertheless, we've
            decided to present <i>The
              Red Shoes</i>. It is the ballet that made her name, whose name
              she made. We present it because we think she would have wished
              it.&quot; The film's final images were back at the location of
              Vicky's accident, with a closeup of her bloody legs (and tights)
              and feet wearing the shoes. When she requested that Julian remove
              her red ballet shoes, she expired.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Rope (1948)</strong>, 80 minutes, D: Alfred
              Hitchcock<br />
              Director Alfred Hitchcock's first Technicolored feature film was
              this experimental thriller, the first of four films
        with James Stewart, and the famed director's most controversial work.
              The stagebound film, based upon   Patrick Hamilton's 1929 play <i>Rope's
              End</i>, was notable for its major experimental &quot;stunt&quot; - the
          seamless intercutting of 10 long takes (ranging from 4 and a half minutes
          to 10 minutes), creating the appearance of the film's action occurring
          all in 'real-time' in a single, continuous shot (of 80 minutes, although
          the film's actual time frame was 100 minutes) - however, there were
          clever splices between takes (and two brief, reverse-angle shots too).
          The story was loosely based on the notorious 1924 Leopold and Loeb
          murder case involving two University of Chicago students who murdered
          a 14 year old for the thrill of it. The film also featured two gay
          villains, both wealthy pseudo-intellectuals and bachelors. The two
          implicitly homosexual and psychopathic college buddies-lovers were
          -- nervous and fearful Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger), and the more
          caustic and arrogant Brandon Shaw (John Dall). In the opening scene,
          the two thrill-killed (by rope strangulation) a third individual, Harvard
          undergraduate and friend David Kentley (Dick Hogan), and then hid his
          body in an antique wooden chest (used as the dining table) while hosting
          a dinner party for David's friends and relatives. The guests invited
          to the occasion were the victim's father Mr. Henry Kentley (Sir Cedric
          Hardwicke) and his aunt Mrs. Anita Atwater (Constance Collier),
          David's fiancee Janet Walker (Joan Chandler), Janet's ex-boyfriend
          Kenneth Lawrence (Douglas Dick), and the killers' ex-prep-school housemaster/teacher
          Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), whose philosophical Nietzsche lectures
          about &quot;superman&quot; (the acceptability of the privileged and superior few to murder inferiors)
          inspired the impressionable pair. In
              one chilling, sexually-tinged scene, Shaw recounted his feelings
              about the murder to Morgan: &quot;I
              don't remember feeling very much of anything -- until his body
              went limp and then I knew it was over...I felt tremendously exhilarated!&quot; Shaw
              also dared the guests, particularly Cadell, to uncover why David
              was conspicuously absent and hinted about their secret that a body
              was concealed in the trunk in the middle of the room. The thriller
              ended when guilt-ridden Cadell suspiciously realized that his former
              students had actually carried out his mad theories. With gunshots,
          he signaled for the police to apprehend the killers. </font></p>        </td>

              Litvak<br />
              Director Anatole Litvak's and 20th Century Fox's still-disturbing
              psychological drama told about the horrors of mental institutions
              (with shadowy images of inmate torture). The daring film was based
              on the fictionalized account of hospitalization in squalid conditions
              by Mary Jane Ward's 1946 semi-autobiographical best-selling novel.
              The non-escapist, controversial drama was a representative social-problem
              film (similar to <i><a href="lostw.html">The
              Lost Weekend (1945)</a></i> dealing with alcoholism, the homefront
              adjustment of returning veterans in <a href="besty.html"><i>The
              Best Years of Our Lives (1946)</i></a>, or the problem of anti-Semitism
              in <i>Gentlemen's Agreement (1947), </i>and the issue of racial
              prejudice in the upcoming <i>Pinky (1949)</i>). It was also one
              of Hollywood's first mainstream films to sympathetically deal with
              the issue of the mentally-ill. Other similar films included Frederick
              Wiseman's documentary <i>Titicut Follies (1967)</i>, 
			  or Best Picture-winning <i><a href="onef.html">One
              Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)</a></i>. In the story's opening,
              young inmate Virginia Stuart Cunningham (Oscar-nominated Olivia
              de Havilland) was sitting on a park bench - completely confused,
              puzzled, and hearing voices. It was revealed that she had been
              institutionalized (after a psychotic breakdown following severe
              depression) in the over-crowded Juniper Hill State Hospital. With
              insomnia, memory loss (amnesia), and mood swings, a confused, withdrawn
              and frightened Virginia could not remember the circumstances of
              her incarceration (&quot;I can't be sure of
              anything anymore&quot;). Chief psychiatrist Dr. Mark Kik (Leo Genn),
              her main compassionate treatment-therapist, used psychotherapy
              techniques (narcosynthesis, hydrotherapy, shock therapy and hypnosis)
              to discover the repressed reasons for her mental illness, pain,
              distress and erratic behavior - seen in various flashbacks of her
              troubled, distraught and bittersweet childhood. With a cold, domineering
              and unloving mother Mrs. Stuart (Natalie Schafer), and a caring
              but strict father Mr. Stuart (Damian O'Flynn), Virginia desperately
              craved love, and became emotionally over-attached to her father.
              She was wracked with guilt when her father died of uremia. Later
              when she was older and dating a fatherless eldest son named Gordon
              (Leif Erickson), she became physically sick when he asked for her
              hand in marriage. While riding with him as a passenger, he was
              tragically killed in a car accident and his death added to her
              feelings of self-blame. The urgent efforts of Virginia's newlywed
              husband Robert Cunningham (Mark Stevens) to cure her and get Virginia
              released failed when she panicked before a hospital staff-panel
              of clinical interrogators. During the session, she became uncontrollably
              paranoid, full of rage, and traumatized (she even bit her doctor),
              and had to be placed in Ward 12 for seriously-ill patients. Instances
            of progress were often followed by setbacks, regression and relapses.
              After a transfer back to Ward 1 where recovering patients were
              about to be released, she experienced a troubling incident with
              tyrannical and abusive nurse Davis (Nancy Craig) and was goaded
              into an emotional outburst. Subsequently, she was punished by being
              placed into a strait-jacket. One of the film's most famous images
              toward the end of the film provided its title of &quot;snake
            pit&quot; - it was the famous top-shot and pull-back view of the
            protagonist, surrounded by insane and babbling patients. She explained
            the over-crowded conditions to Dr. Kik: &quot;It
            was strange - here I was among all those people, and at the same
            time, I felt as if I were looking at them from someplace far away.
            The whole place seemed to me like a deep hole, and the people down
            in it like strange animals, like, like snakes, and I'd been thrown
            into it, yes, as though, as though I were in a snake pit....And I
            was shocked into thinking that maybe I wasn't as sick as the others
            and I really might get well.&quot; With
            further personal and proper care from her sensiitive doctor, she
              was returned to Ward 1  and was able to again appear
            before the hospital staff as a confident, cured and recovered patient.
            She had reached self-understanding and sanity - and was released. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Sorry, Wrong Number (1948), </b>89 minutes, D:
              Anatole Litvak<br />
              This engrossing,
             expressionistically-filmed, dark psychological thriller and film
              noir was adapted from a famous and popular 1943 CBS radio play
              (one-half hour) with Agnes Moorehead by the play's author Lucille
              Fletcher. It was later remade as a 1989 TV movie starring Loni
              Anderson. The suspenseful film told about bedridden, spoiled, manipulative
              hypochondriac heiress Leona Stevenson (Oscar-nominated Barbara
              Stanwyck), whose domineering father was wealthy drug company industrialist
              James &quot;J.B.&quot; Cotterell (Ed Begley). She lived alone in a Manhattan apartment where she
              was basically helpless and confined to her bed or wheelchair if
              her nurse was not in attendance. One day, she accidentally overheard
              a crossed-wires telephone conversation between two thugs. The strangers
              were discussing the lurid details of a planned murder plot for
              that evening at 11:15 (the exact time of a loud, passing train).
              (Did she hear plans for her own murder?) Then, the invalid, psychosomatic
              woman received two other strange phone calls on her phone (PLaza
              5-1098), and slowly suspected that she might be the object of
              the homicide. When she reported her fears to the operator and to
              authorities, they didn't believe her. She made phone calls to try
              and locate her missing, weak-minded, henpecked and greedy husband
              Henry J. Stevenson (Burt Lancaster), who was originally portrayed
              as obedient and loving. Through a series of well-constructed flashbacks,
              she recalled her first encounter with her husband, how she stole
              him away, and remembered parts of her life with him and others.
              More calls were made to her husband's secretary Elizabeth Jennings
              (Dorothy Neumann), to her former married acquaintance Sally Hunt
              Lord (Ann Richards) (Henry's blonde ex-girlfriend), and to her
              own doctor Dr. Phillip Alexander (Wendell Corey). She was told
              that her recent diagnosis that she was psychosomatic (meaning she
              could be cured) had been kept secret from her by Henry. Leona also
              spoke to chemist Waldo Evans (Harold Vermilyea) at her father's
              pharmaceutical company, the Cotterell drug company, where Henry
              worked as a decorative VP. She became aware that the frustrated
              Henry had a number of dirty secrets including his role as an amateur
              corporate thief - he was suspiciously meeting with Sally for lunch,
              while he was being swindled and blackmailed over a plan to steal
              drugs from the company and sell them to a professional gangster
              fence named Morano (William Conrad). Reportedly, Henry was bypassing
              Morano to fence the drugs himself, for higher profits. There
              had been an exchange of money at a deserted Staten Island house
              (belonging to Waldo). Coincidentally, Sally was married to city
              district attorney Fred Lord (Leif Erickson) who was investigating
              Henry and building a case against him. Was it possible that Henry
              was attempting to inherit his wife's estate (and an insurance payout)
              to pay off a lost-profits debt of $200,000 to the blackmailing
              Morano, by hiring a hitman to kill Leona? Powerless and with time
              dwindling in the thrilling finale, the victimized Leona became
              increasingly desperate and frantically tried to call Henry for
              help before it was too late. When he finally called her, she tearfully
              apologized and promised any money that he needed. During their
              conversation in the film's twist ending, Henry began to realize
              that the police had already captured Morano and his thugs, and
              that they had discovered the burned down Staten Island house. He
              no longer had to raise money and Leona's murder was now completely
              unnecessary. Henry instructed Leona to go to her balcony and scream
              for help, but it was  too late. He listened helplessly as
              an intruder entered her room and strangled her to death. In the
              final line of dialogue when Henry called back, he heard the film's
              title spoken by an unknown man: &quot;Sorry, wrong number.&quot;  </font></p>          </td>

          minutes, D: Mu Fei<br />
          This melancholy, haunting romantic melodrama
          was about a love triangle, similar to the themes of David Lean's
          <i><a href="brie.html">Brief Encounter (1945, UK)</a> </i>and Kar-Wai
          Wong's <i>In The Mood
          For Love (2000, HK/China)</i>.
          It was
          based on Li Tianji's short story, and was remade by Zhuangzhuang
          Tian's as <i>Springtime in a Small Town (2002, China)</i>. It remains
           one of the greatest Chinese films ever made. It was shot in the post-war
          period when China had been devastated by Japanese occupation during
          the Sino-Japanese War, and had not yet been overtaken by Mao Tse Tung's
          Communist Party. The delicate, non-political, slowly-paced film was
          suppressed and banned by the Communists and not available for viewing
          until the 1980s. In the story, Zhou Yuwen (Wei Wei) lived a lonely,
          unsatisfied, unhappy and dejected life, shackled and frustrated by
          her care for her gentle and kind, but sickly and emasculated husband-landowner
          Dai Liyan (Shi Yu), once prosperous but now poor. His teenaged sister
          Dai Xiu (Zhang Hongmei) and faithful servant Lao Huang (Cui Chaoming)
          also lived in their dilapidated home, the ruins of a large estate.
          When her childhood sweetheart from ten years earlier, Zhang Zhichen
          (Li Wei), also Liyan's best friend and now a Shanghai doctor, reappeared
          into Yuwen's life, lustful urges began to develop along with conflicted

          <p><font size="2"><b>State of the Union (1948), </b>124 minutes, D:
              Frank Capra<br />
              Director Frank Capra's and MGM's politically-tinged
              romantic melodrama and political satire was about the 'state of
              the union' of an estranged couple brought together for expediency's
              sake. It was adapted by scriptwriters Myles Connolly and Anthony
              Veiller from the original Pulitzer Prize-winning 1945 Broadway
              play by Russel Crouse and Howard Lindsay. It was the 5th of 9 films
              made by the collaborative team of Tracy and Hepburn. In the plot,
              Grant Matthews (Spencer Tracy) and his estranged wife Mary Matthews
              (Katharine Hepburn) were brought together during Grant's Presidential
              campaign. The wealthy, self-made industrialist-tycoon, an airplane
              manufacturer, was coerced to run for the top position by his new
              mistress - over-bearing, ruthless, and seductive Republican newspaper
              publisher Kay Thorndyke (Angela Lansbury). The power-hungry millionaireness-villainess
              of Thorndyke Press (a chain of newspapers) would bankroll Grant's
               campaign as a 'dark horse' Republican candidate for the highest
              office (he would be promoted as a sincere man of the common people).
               He would be managed by voracious, manipulative political strategist
              Jim Conover (Adolphe Menjou) and newspaper columnist-journalist
              'Spike' McManus (Van Johnson) who served as his press secretary.
              To avoid character issues in his marital background, and for appearance's
              sake, Grant's separated wife Mary, an idealist, was required to
              pose as his devoted and faithful 'wife by his side.' Unavoidably
              as they spent time together during the campaign, their romantic
              affections for each other were rekindled. Mary opposed Grant's
              willingness to sacrifice and deceitfully compromise his honesty
              and ideals for political expediency (due to Kay Thorndyke's manipulative
              urgings), in order to win influential backers, the primaries and
              delegate votes in the 1948 Republican National Convention. In the
            stirring conclusion, he was prepared to deliver a  live, nationwide
            radio (and TV) speech broadcast to 20 million people as a 'fireside
            chat' from his Long Island home. He interrupted
            Mary's glowing introduction that praised him as &quot;honest, uncompromising,
            fearless, a man of great vision and enormous courage.&quot; Grant
            realized that Mary had also been corrupted by his Washington-based
            power brokers-backers who were fraudulent and dishonest.
            The self-respecting Presidential candidate finally understood how
            he had turned against and &quot;sold out&quot; his own values (due
            to his wife's valuable perspective) to a &quot;gang of corrupt politicians.&quot; He
            stepped forward to denounce his own behavior and any further duplicity
            on Mary's part. He also refused to be cut off, yelling out angrily
            as he seized the microphone: &quot;Don't
          you shut me off. I'm paying for this broadcast!...I have as much right
          to run for President as a gutter-rat!&quot; He
          openly  admitted his tremendous wrong-doings and complicity: (&quot;I
          am no lamb led to the slaughter, I ran to it...My whole campaign was
          a fraud!&quot;). He  urged all of the other party candidates
          to be honest, to denounce phoniness, and to not become &quot;double-dealers
          and crooks.&quot; After his appeal, he withdrew himself from the competition,
          and apologized to the audience and to Mary, asking for her forgiveness.
          However, he then promised to reform the political landscape: &quot;I'm
          gonna open doors, break down windows, let in fresh air. I'm going after
          every candidate who compromises, and I'm going after every lazy voter
          who doesn't vote.&quot; After the speech, the Matthews
            were reconciled and saved their marriage, press secretary 'Spike'
          was fired, and the icy, powers-behind-the-throne Kay Thorndyke and
          unscrupulous strategist Jim Conover were forced to find a new candidate. </font></p>          </td>

                  Madre (1948)</a>,</b> 119 minutes, D: John Huston<br />
            Director and screenwriter John Huston's classic adventure film, an
            adaptation of B. Traven's 1927 novel, was about
            three  gold prospectors in the Mexican wilderness - it was
            essentially a tale of lustful greed, treachery, paranoia and suspicion.
            The three ill-matched men in the mid-1920s included  innocent,
            honest and young American  Curtin (Tim Holt),  wise and experienced,
            fast-talking, grizzly, toothless old-timer  Howard (Walter Huston,
            the director's father), and Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), a greedy,
            deranged, selfish bastard who distrusted everyone. The two down-and-out
            drifters Curtin and Dobbs had first met in Tampico, Mexico (where
            Dobbs won the lottery), before teaming up with Howard - whom they
            met in a cheap flophouse. Their gold booty strike and fortune in
            the Sierra Madre Mountains bred violence and &quot;gold fever,&quot; the
            threat of Mexican bandits led by Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya) who posed
            as the Federales, an end to their gold-digging friendships, and the
            homicidal undoing of the avaricious Dobbs when he was killed for
            his boots and mule by Gold Hat's bandits. The Mexican outlaws did
            not realize that the 'dust' in Dobbs' saddle bags was gold. It ended
            with an ironic climactic scene when the wind blew the discarded gold
            dust away - back into the Sierra Madres.</font></p></td>

        minutes, D: Preston Sturges<br />
        Director-producer-writer Preston Sturges'  wonderfully stylish and witty
        fantasy-screwball comedy was the last of his Hollywood films. It was
        remade, unsuccessfully, with Dudley Moore in the lead role in 1984. The
        black comedy was unsuccessful at the time of its release, possibly due
        to the scandalous circumstances surrounding the suicide of star Rex Harrison's
        lover - troubled actress Carole Landis, when he refused to get a divorce
        and marry her. The splendid, fine farce, told with a non-linear narrative,
        was the tale of British, middle-aged reknowned symphony orchestra conductor
        Sir Alfred de Carter (Rex Harrison) who suspected his lovely younger
        wife Daphne (Linda Darnell) of infidelity. During a visit to England,
        his wealthy brother-in-law August Henshler (Rudy Vallee), due to a misunderstanding
        (&quot;Keep an eye on my wife for me&quot;), had taken him literally
        and hired private investigator Detective Sweeney (Edgar Kennedy) to &quot;sleuth
         after&quot; Sir Alfred's wife  in his absence. After reading the report
        upon his return, the jealous Sir Alfred suspected that Daphne was having
        an affair with his own young private secretary, Anthony Windborn (Kurt
        Kreuger). Then, while leading his orchestra in three different pieces,
        Sir Alfred elaborately daydreamed three very different versions or scenarios
        of how he would solve the problem of his wife's alleged infidelity -
        each one accompanied by a classical music piece that matched the mood.
        During the conducting of Rossini's overture to the opera <i> Semiramide</i>,
            Sir Alfred imagined himself, in a complex and ingenious revenge fantasy,
            murdering <i>femme fatale</i> Daphne by razor-slashing and plotting
        to frame and convict Windborn for the crime. While performing the second
        number, Richard Wagner's reconciliation theme from <i>Tannhauser</i>,
            Sir Alfred fantasized about nobly accepting the alleged infidelity
              by writing Daphne a large check, forgiving the young couple, and
              allowing his wife to run off with her young lover. And while conducting
              the third piece - the finale, Tchaikovsky's tone poem <i>Francesca
              da Rimini</i> overture, he saw himself challenging Daphne and
            Tony to a fatal game of Russian roulette. While the plans worked
              perfectly in his mind, he stumbled and bumbled his way through
              the preparations in real life to murder Daphne (the first scenario)
              with a complicated recording device. At last, realizing how deliriously
              silly and irrational he had been, he cheerfully embraced and kissed
              his loving wife, who had never been unfaithful, and was unaware
              of his plotting. (She reluctantly revealed that her sister
              Barbara Henshler (Barbara Lawrence) was suspected of having an
              affair with Tony.) In the film's ending, Sir Alfred told Daphne
              as he hugged her and expressed his extreme love for her: &quot;I
              want to be seen in your exquisite company. I want the whole world
              to know that I'm the most fortunate of men in the possession of
              the most magnificent of wives. I want to swim in champagne and
              paint the whole town not only red, but red, white and blue. I want
              everybody to see how much I adore you, always have adored you,
              revere you and - and trust you. Also how much I hope you have of
              warmth for me....&quot; His words concluded the film: &quot;A thousand poets
              dreamed a thousand years. Then you were born, my love.&quot;</font></p>        </td>
