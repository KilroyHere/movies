            Hazanavicius<br />
            This B/W film was a Best Picture, Best Actor, and
            Best Director Oscar winner, and  the first mainly silent film to
            win the top Academy Award since <i>Wings (1927)</i>. It was set in
            the year 1927 in Hollywood, where the title character: swashbuckling,
            handsome, mustachioed silent movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin)
            was enjoying huge box-office success as a matinee idol with Kinograph
            Studios in silent pictures, working for cigar-chomping studio boss
            Al Zimmer (John Goodman). Married to wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller)
            and possessing a devoted pet dog named Jack (Uggie), he happened
            to meet flirtatious ingenue/chorus girl Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice
            Bejo) and promoted the aspiring actress to work in the film industry.
            As Peppy's career began to blossom within a few years, at the dawn
            of the talkies, George's career started to fade. His own financing,
            directing and starring role in his own production <i>Tears of Love</i> opened
            to compete with Peppy's much more popular, new sound film <i>Beauty
            Spot</i> (named after her affected beauty mark) - both coinciding
            with the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and he was financially ruined,
            destitute and bankrupted. His world-weary wife left him and he was
            forced to move into his own apartment. In drunken despair, he set
            fire to his collection of old nitrate-stock silent films and nearly
            expired. Peppy visited George in the hospital and brought him to
            her grand villa to recover. At the villa, he discovered that his
            dismissed loyal valet/chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell) now worked
            for Peppy, and that she had purchased all of his auctioned-off personal
            effects. He suicidally threatened to kill himself, but was saved
            by Peppy who successfully urged her studio to feature George as her
            non-speaking, tap-dance partner in her next film - a sound musical.</font></p>          </td>

            D: Paul Feig<br />
            This hilarious, irreverent and quick-witted R-rated comedy about
            female buddy-friendship boasted the tagline: &quot;Chick Flicks Don't
            Have to Suck.&quot; It told about a jealousy-based competition that
            quickly developed between two affection-seeking females for the love,
            friendship and attention of an engaged bride-to-be.  In
            the female-centric plot, mid-30s, lovelorn single female Annie Walker
            (Kristen Wiig) was introduced living in Milwaukee in an apartment
            (with two  socially-clueless, British immigrant siblings as roommates).
            She was having dysfunctional sex with her uncaring, shallow, self-absorbed
            and misogynistic sex partner Ted (Jon Hamm), who insisted on having
            no-strings-attached, casual sex. Over lunch the next day with her
            best friend Lillian Donovan (Maya Rudolph), Annie was advised to
            find someone better. After the failure of her dream bakery store
            Cake Baby that she had opened during a recession, the underachieving
            retail store pastry chef Annie had resorted to unfulfilling work
            as a low-paid jewelry store clerk at Cholodecki's where her recovering
            alcoholic boss Don Cholodecki (Michael Hitchcock) chastised her for
            poor salesmanship. The film's turning point came when she was
            asked by her very best and oldest friend, recently-engaged Lillian
            Donovan, to be her maid of honor (and wedding planner) at her impending
            wedding to a wealthy Chicago banker named Doug/&quot;Dougie&quot; Price
            (Tim Heidecker). At a fancy outdoor engagement party at Lillian's
            house, Annie met the ceremony's four bridesmaids: Lillian's blonde,
            older, marriage-cynical and sexy older cousin Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey),
            naive, idealistic and sickly-in-love, newly-wed friend and work
            colleague Becca (Ellie Kemper), the brash, loud-mouthed, uncouth,
            vulgar, slobbish  sister of the groom Megan Price (Melissa McCarthy);
            and the seemingly-perfect, pretty, snobbishly-wealthy, controlling,
            and vain sophisticate with a Type A personality Helen Harris III
            (Rose Byrne) - the wife of Perry Harris (Andy Buckley), the boss
            of Lillian's fiancee. Almost immediately, the
            insecure Annie took a jealous and personal dislike to Helen, over
            who was Lillian's best friend.  Lunch was arranged by Annie for all
            the bridesmaids in a cheap, local and seedy Brazilian steak restaurant.
            Afterwards,  the group was led to an upscale, posh and chic
            wedding gown studio-shop (<i>Belle en Blanc</i>) where Annie was
            told she needed a reservation and was denied entry. The influential
            Helen who knew the store's manager Whitney (Jessica St. Clair) upstaged
            her and they were quickly allowed access. One of the funniest scenes
            occurred during their visit when everyone except Helen (who ordered
            a salad) came down with extreme diarrhea due to food poisoning from
            the restaurant lunch stop. After the fiasco at the bridal shop, Annie
            suggested a bachelorette party at Lillian's parent's Lake House,
            but Helen co-opted the situation and proposed instead an expensive
            trip to Las Vegas. Maid of honor Annie refused a first-class ticket
            offered to her by Helen and sat in the economy seats instead. Plans
            were aborted for a Las Vegas bachelorette party when Annie became
            inebriated, refused to obey flight attendants and return to her seat,
            and the plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Casper,
            WY, where the group was escorted from the plane.  The bachelorette
            party was cancelled, and the group was forced to take a Chicago-bound
            bus back to Milwaukee. Annie's apologies to Lillian were overruled
            - Helen was appointed to take over all future wedding plans for both
            the bridal shower and the marital ceremony itself. Meanwhile,
            Annie became increasingly acquainted with Irish-American
            State Patrol Officer Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who kept pressuring
            her to reopen her bakery business. Annie also faced two further disruptions
            in her life - she lost her job at the jewelry store, and she was
             asked to leave by her apartment mates. At a
             fancy bridal shower brunch held at the Harris estate in Chicago,
             the extreme micro-managing Helen (who had borrowed Annie's idea
             about its Parisian theme) again outperformed Annie's handmade shower
             gift (of her favorite things and mementos) by presenting Lillian
             with a pre-wedding vacation trip to Paris to attend a gown fitting
             with a top designer. Everything culminated in Annie throwing a
              temper tantrum and being barred from the shower and the wedding.
              In the film's turn-around conclusion, on the big day of Lillian's
              wedding, Helen appeared at Annie's door requesting her help in
              finding Lillian who had disappeared. Helen apologized for splitting
              the friendship between Lillian and Annie, and admitted that she
              was lonely and had few friends: (&quot;I'm basically just by myself&quot;),
              and that Lillian had only requested her help because of her skill
              at organizing parties, and not because of friendship. The overwhelmed
              Lillian was found hiding out in her apartment. She admitted that
              she was fearful of Helen's extravagant, micromanaged wedding plans
              and her future new life outside of Milwaukee, and also was apologetic
              to Annie for being left out of the proceedings. Lillian
              and Annie were reconciled, and Annie was restored as the maid of
              honor. At the fancy wedding, Helen had arranged for neon
            signs, fireworks and an appearance by Wilson Phillips. After the
            wedding, Annie was reconciled with an apologetic Helen, who had
            orchestrated a reunion for her with  Nathan. After kissing her, Nathan
               invited her to be &quot;arrested&quot; and ride in the backseat
              of his squad car with flashing lights and a siren - there was hope
               for a real romance with Officer Rhodes.</font></p>

            D: Alexander Payne<br />
            Director Alexander Payne's family marriage dramedy, set in Hawaii,
            was based upon Kaui Hart Hemmings's 2007 novel of the same name.
            Indifferent husband and beleaguered father in a floundering marriage
            - mildly-disheveled Honolulu lawyer Matthew &quot;Matt&quot; King (George Clooney),
            was forced to deal with the tragedy of his wife Elizabeth (Patricia
            Hastie) who suffered head trauma during a waterskiing accident off
            of Waikiki, and was in a terminal coma (surviving only with life-support
            equipment). As an oblivious, hands-off &quot;backup
          parent,&quot; he had two daughters to contend with:  sassy,
          drug-using, resentful and reckless 17-year-old Alexandra (Shailene
          Woodley) who had been attending a private boarding school on the Big
          Island, and forlorn 10-year-old Scotty (Amara Miller) who was foul-mouthed
          and in open rebellion against his parental authority. Alexandra, who
          was involved with her slacker boyfriend Sid (Nick Krause), revealed
          to her clueless, workaholic father that her love-neglected mother was
          involved in domestic betrayal and planned to divorce him. Matt engaged
          in long search to stalk and ultimately confront the cheating real estate
          agent Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard), who was married to his unaware
          wife Julie Speer (Judy Greer) and vacationing in a cottage on Kauai.
          In the film's conclusion, Matt decided not to sell an immense land
          trust (a holding acquired from descendants that would result in a huge
          payoff) to Kaua'i native Don Hollitzer, the brother-in-law of Speer.
          Matt was managing the property for his extended <i>haole</i> family
           - 25,000 acres of unspoiled land on the island of Kauai. It was the
           last untouched paradisical inheritance of Hawaiian royalty to be developed.
           His decision was made, in part, to spite his avaricious, affable and
           dissolute cousin Hugh (Beau Bridges), and possibly to deprive developer
           Speer of a rich commission. In the ending scene (under the credits)
          after Elizabeth's ashes were scattered in the ocean, the reconciled
          family sat together in silence on the sofa, under their mother's quilt,
          eating ice cream and watching <i>March of the Penguins (2005)</i>

            Winding Refn<br />
          This violent action-crime drama told about the day and nighttime jobs
          of the nameless &quot;driver&quot; (Ryan Gosling). By day in Los Angeles,
          he was a Hollywood daredevil action-movie stunt car driver and garage
          mechanic, and at night, he was hired by criminals to drive getaway
          cars after heists. His associate was garage body-shop boss and mentor
          Shannon (Bryan Cranston), who arranged all the heist details for each
          job. The mysterious life of the soft-spoken lone-wolf living in an
          apartment in Echo Park, CA was solitary, mostly quiet, and simple.
          His life began to change after meeting his lonely, vulnerable, pretty
          neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her 6 year-old son Benicio (Kaden
          Leos). Meanwhile, Shannon negotiated with two sinister low-level mobsters:
          transplanted menacing NY crime boss/loan shark Bernie Rose (Albert
          Brooks) and his hot-headed thuggish partner Nino (Ron Perlman), to
          borrow $300,000, so that the
          &quot;driver&quot; could invest in a race-car. After
          her desperate husband - convicted petty felon Standard Gabriel (Oscar
          Isaac), was released from prison, Standard was pressured by a higher-up
           Mafia criminal, an Albanian named Cook (James Biberi) who was his
          previous employer, to commit a daytime robbery of a pawn shop for $40,000,
          to pay off his debt incurred in prison for being protected. The  &quot;driver&quot;
          reluctantly agreed to help cooperate with the heist, to assist the
          ex-con in reestablishing his life. But the robbery, involving the &quot;driver,&quot;
          Standard, and Cook's femme fatale associate Blanche (Christina Hendricks)
          was seriously botched. Standard was killed by Blanche
           when it appeared to be a set-up
          between Cook and Blanche to abscond with a million dollars. The &quot;driver&quot; barely
          escaped with his life after killing a few of Cook's henchmen after
          one of them shotgunned Blanche to death. After more retaliation and
          a number of other bloody murders, including the deaths of Cook, Shannon,
          Nino, and Bernie, the &quot;driver&quot; found
          himself stabbed in the stomach but alive, after earlier parting on
          good terms with Irene and Benicio. </font></p>          </td>

            minutes, D: David Fincher<br />
            Both director David Fincher's English-language remake and the earlier,
            original Swedish 2009 film were based upon Swedish author/ journalist
            Stieg Larsson's 2005 psychological thriller novel of the same name.
            The crime-thriller drama told the story of Stockholm journalist Mikael
            Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who was disgraced and discredited for publishing
            stories of government corruption in his co-owned magazine <i>Millennium.</i> After
            losing a libel lawsuit against him, he met with retired tycoon-businessman
             Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) on his remote family estate
            on Hedestad Island to allegedly help him with writing his memoirs,
            but was more importantly hired to  investigate
            the disappearance (and presumed murder) of a young girl from
            Vanger's wealthy family about 40 years earlier. The missing victim
            was Vanger's 16 year-old niece Harriet. He teamed
              up for assistance from Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), an anti-social,
              troubled, eccentric computer hacker who was being sexually and
            physically abused by her new sadistic state-appointed parole officer
            and legal guardian Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen). In an unlikely
            pairing, Salander joined Blomkvist to research the mysterious case
            even though she had been hired by Vanger to illegally supply information
            on Blomkvist's past during the libel case. As it turned out, as they
            both sleuthed the case (and dug deep into the Vanger's dysfunctional
            past family history), Blomkvist and Salander came upon many darker
            and more ominous secrets and murders, involving anti-Semitism, Nazis
            and the Holocaust. There were clues to a number of serial murders
            of young women    from 1947
            to 1967, committed by Harriet's  late father Gottfried Vanger (Henrik's
            brother) and by his son Martin (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd), the current
            CEO of Vanger Industries. Harriet (Joely Richardson) was found still
            alive, living in London in hiding, and posing as her now-dead cousin
            Anita. She described how her brother Martin had continued to sexually
            abuse her after she killed Gottfried in an act of self-defense (drowning).
            Following death threats against Blomkvist,
            the journalist was captured by Martin and threatened with hanging.
            Salander arrived, rescued him and pursued Martin on her motorcycle
            before witnessing his death in a fiery crash. Harriet was able to
            reunite with Henrik back in Sweden. Salander also uncovered incriminating
            information against Blomkvist's opponent in his earlier libel suit
            and helped to vindicate and clear his name. </font></p>          </td>

            minutes, D: David Yates <br />
          This adventure-fantasy film for children/families was the 8th and final
          installment of the popular and highly-successful
           <a href="series-harrypotter.html"><em>Harry
          Potter</em></a> series-franchise. It was the highest-grossing (domestic)
          film of 2011. It was the direct and continuing sequel to the 7th film,
          <i><a href="series-harrypotter7.html">Harry Potter and the Deathly
          Hallows, Part 1 (2010)</a></i>. Both films were based on J.K. Rowling's
          7th and final novel of the same name published in 2007. In the series'
          concluding story,  the quest continued 
          to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes)  remaining
          four Horcruxes to render him mortal. Voldemort had become more powerful
          after stealing the Elder Wand from Albus Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon)
          opened tomb. Part 2 opened with the threesome of Harry
          Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermione
          Granger (Emma Watson) at Shell Cottage mourning the loss of Dobby who
          had rescued them at Malfoy Manor. Meanwhile, Harry enlisted injured
          goblin Griphook (Warwick Davis) to join him, along with Ron and Hermione,
          to help break into Bellatrix Lestrange's (Helena Bonham Carter) vault
          at Gringotts' Bank, to retrieve one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, in exchange
          for Godric Gryffindor's Sword. In the vault, they recovered the Horcrux:
          Helga Hufflepuff's golden cup, but then Griphook betrayed them, and
          they narrow escaped. Harry realized that the next Horcrux was at Hogwarts
          School castle that was somehow connected to Rowena Ravenclaw. The school
          was now overrun by Death Eaters and Dementors and was led by Headmaster
          Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). With aid from Abeforth Dumbledore (Ciar&aacute;n
          Hinds), Albus' younger brother, the trio entered into Hogswarts, led
          by student friend Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) along with other
          student resistance fighters and members of Dumbledore's resistance
          army (DA) (members of the Order of the Phoenix). At the same time,
          Voldemort  had summoned his army to Hogwarts to surround it and
          begin combat. In the Chamber of Secrets, Hermione destroyed the Horcrux
          cup with a Basilisk fang. The second horcrux, Rowena Ravenclaw's lost
          Diadem, or tiara-like crown, was also destroyed in the Room of Requirement
          by Harry with the fang. In a vision, Harry realized  that another Horcrux
          was Voldemort's snake Nagini. To eliminate Snape, Voldemort ordered
          Nagini to kill him and Snape was mortally
          wounded. Harry envisioned that he had to die &quot;at the proper moment&quot;
                - and &quot;Voldemort himself must do it.&quot; He was compelled
                to destroy the part of Voldemort's soul within himself (another
                horcrux) that would be a further step toward killing Voldemort.
                In the Forbidden Forest, Harry was blasted by Voldemort's Elder
                Wand with a Killing <i>Avada
                Kedavra</i> curse. 
              Harry was given the choice to either go back and confront Voldemort,
              or continue to the afterlife. Harry chose to return to the forest,
              but faked his death for awhile in order to find the right time
                to come alive and lead the film's climactic Battle of Hogwarts
                against Voldemort. Voldemort and Harry engaged
              in a one-on-one duel with their wands (the Elder Wand vs. Harry's
              wand that he had taken from Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton)), while in
                the Great Hall, Ron's mother Molly Weasley (Julie Walters)  
                hurled deadly curses at Bellatrix Lestrange.
                At the same time, Ron and Hermione pursued Nagini, the last Horcrux.
                Neville retrieved the Sword of Gryffindor and used it to decapitate
                Nagini. With the last Horcrux now destroyed, the now-vulnerable
                Voldemort weakened, dropped to his knees in front of Harry, was
                hit by his own rebounding Killing Curse, and disintegrated into
                nothingness. Harry snapped the Elder Wand in two to destroy it.
                In the epilogue set 19 years later, Harry
                and wife Ginny (Bonnie Wright), and the married couple of Ron
                and Hermione proudly watched their children leave for Hogwarts
                at King's Cross station. </font></p>          </td>

            a trilogy of films about port cities - this one set in the French
            Normandy city of Le Havre. The heartwarming, optimistic

            into Europe - the film's title meant &quot;The Haven.&quot; Lowly, elderly
            shoeshiner Marcel Marx (Andr&eacute; Wilms)
              had recently relocated to Le Havre where he lived with his wife
              Arletty (Kati Outinen). The ex-bohemian Marcel had formerly been

            dog La&iuml;ka and
              a local bar. At the same time that Arletty became seriously ill
              and was hospitalized (with a terminal illness diagnosis), he learned

              named Idrissa (Blondin Miguel) from a cargo
              ship misrouted from Gabon, who had escaped from authorities. He
              decided to hide the boy from police in his home, with help from

              attempts to aid the boy in getting to his destination (London)

            as servants (&quot;the help&quot;) in white households in Jackson, MS during
            the early 1960s. In the community, recent University of Mississippi
            (Ole Miss) graduate and aspiring white journalist Eugenia &quot;Skeeter&quot; Phelan
            (Emma Stone) had returned to her upper-class cotton plantation home.
            She learned to her dismay that her mother Charlotte Phelan (Allison
            Janney) had fired Constantine Bates (Cicely Tyson), her beloved black
            childhood maid who had raised her. Unfulfilled as a local newspaper
            columnist promoting household tips, Skeeter made ambitious plans
            to write an expose book with her Harper &amp; Row editor-in-chief in
            NY, Elaine Stein (Mary Steenburgen). The misfit debutante began to
            conduct a series of interviews for her secret book project, told
            from the point-of-view of black maids employed in Jackson, although
            many were reluctant at first to share their stories. She first spoke
            to Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and recently-fired, outspoken Minerva
            &quot;Minny&quot; Jackson (Octavia Spencer). 
           Aibileen devotedly worked as a nanny for socialite
          Elizabeth Leefolt (Ahna O'Reilly), to care for her neglected daughter
          Mae Mobley (Emma/Eleanor Henry), while Minny had worked for Mrs. Walters
           (Sissy Spacek). Mrs. Walters' mean, manipulative and heartless daughter Hillary &quot;Hilly&quot; Walters
          Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) had fired Minny for
          using the home's guest bathroom. Hilly led the
          white women's socialite group in town that would
          often gather to plan charity-balls, play bridge, and gossip. She was
          also president of the city's Junior League chapter, and was promoting
           a segregationist bill forcing white homes to have a separate bathroom
          for their &quot;help.&quot; Minny  was rehired
          by ostracized housewife Celia Rae Foote (Jessica Chastain) who was
          not part of the socialite crowd. The revelation
          of Skeeter's book caused an uproar when it began to expose the racist
          attitudes of some of the prominent white members of the community.
          A retributive incident known as the &quot;terrible awful&quot; was detailed in
          the book, referencing Minny's revenge by baking a chocolate pie (with
          excrement ingredients) for Hilly that caused her extreme embarrassment.
          In the film's conclusion, Skeeter learned about her mother's reluctant
          reason for firing Constantine, and Hilly (seeking revenge against Skeeter's
          book) was able to bully Elizabeth into firing Aibileen after framing
          her for theft. In the tearjerking conclusion, Aibileen bid farewell
          to young Mae. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Hugo (2011)</strong>, 128 minutes, D: Martin
            Scorsese<br />
            Director Martin Scorsese's period-specific, family-friendly fantasy-adventure
            drama, enhanced by 3-D, was based upon the 2007 book <i>The Invention
            of Hugo Cabret</i> by Brian Selznick. It served as a loving tribute
            to the beginnings of film. Set in the 1930s, the central character
            in the magical film was 12 year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield)
            who lived with his widowed master clockmaker father (Jude Law), who
            was a museum employee and avid admirer of the films of French cinematic
            pioneer Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s, the legendary &quot;father
            of special effects.&quot;
             After his father's death in a museum fire, the orphaned Hugo was
            sent to live with his drunken Uncle Claude Cabret (Ray Winstone),
            who maintained the clocks at Paris' Gare Montparnasse railway station.
            Hugo learned to wind the massive clocks but then his uncle mysteriously
            disappeared. Hugo began to live alone at the train station to maintain
            the clocks, and to repair and rebuild his father's most ambitious
             project from the museum's archives: a broken automaton
            (mechanical man) who might have a secret message. While keeping
            notes about the repair, Hugo began to collect and steal tools, gears,
            and other parts from various places including a storefront candy
            and toy-stand owned by elderly Georges (Ben Kingsley). After he was
            caught for theft  and his notebook was confiscated, the
            boy was threatened with discipline and being sent to an orphanage
            by the station's lone and handicapped gendarme - Train Inspector
            (Sacha Baron Cohen).  In exchange for not being reprimanded, Georges
            agreed to have Hugo become an apprentice in his shop to reacquire
            his notebook and earn money to pay for the stolen items. Hugo then
            met Georges' orphaned, teenaged god-daughter Isabelle (Chlo&euml; Grace
            Moretz). During his acquaintance with her, Hugo realized she possessed
            the last item needed to make the automaton functional again - a heart-shaped
            key. The key activated the automaton to draw an image from Georges
            Melies' silent sci-fi film <a href="voya.html"><i>Voyage
            dans la Lune (1902) (aka A Trip to the Moon)</i></a> that was signed
            by Isabelle's godfather. The picture was   of the 'man in
            the moon' crying because a rocket had been lodged in its eye. On
            his adventure with Isabelle, Hugo met  film-scholar
            Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg) and became inspired by the true-life
            story of film-maker Georges M&eacute;li&egrave;s. They learned the
            true connection between the automaton and her godfather - Papa Georges
            was actually the accomplished pre-war director of many films for
            his own Star Film Company before his career was bankrupted. The automaton
            he had built had been donated to the museum where Hugo's father worked.
            In the happy ending, Georges agreed to adopt Hugo.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Iron Lady (2011),</strong> 105 minutes,
            D: Phyllida Lloyd<br />
            From Britain came this biographical political drama based upon John
            Campbell's 2011 biography &quot;<i>The Iron Lady: Margaret Thatcher,
            from Grocer's Daughter to Prime Minister</i>&quot;. The quasi-biopic was
            about the influential life and infamous career of former conservative
            British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (convincingly portrayed
            by Meryl Streep). She was   the first woman
            and longest-serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the 20th
            century. The film was told through flashbacks
            of her conversations as a very elderly Thatcher, approaching senility
            and dementia, while speaking to the ghost of her late businessman
            husband Denis Thatcher (Jim Broadbent). Her lower middle-class childhood
            years were surveyed when she (young Margaret Roberts was played by
            Alexandra Roach) worked in her father Alfred Roberts' (Iain Glen)
            grocery store, and then was admitted to Oxford University. After
             her humble beginnings, her political rise was marked by both successes
            and failures. She was first elected in 1959 and  struggled to
            make it as a female outsider in a male-dominated British government,
            to become a member of the Conservative Party and to find a seat in
            the House of Commons. The film also surveyed her ascendancy as the
            only woman to ever become Prime Minister of the UK, from 1979-1990.
            The major events of her leadership of the UK were touched upon, including
            economic woes, various riots, strikes and bombings, the Falklands
            War in 1982, and an insurgency from within her own party that finally
            unseated her. She experienced a disheartening fall from grace after
            more than three decades of service. Her unwavering, rigid, single-mindedness
            and sense of purpose, even though sometimes unpopular and polarizing,
            earned her the imperious nickname &quot;The Iron Lady.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

            minutes, D: Lars von Trier<br />
            Controversial director Lars von Trier's R-rated, sci-fi, end of the
            world arthouse drama was the middle film in a &quot;Depression&quot; trilogy
            of films, also with <i>Antichrist (2009)</i> and <i>Nymphomaniac
            (2013)</i> (in two volumes). The film's basic nihilistic plot was
            about two sisters in a strained relationship: severely depressed,
            troubled and melancholic Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and over-controlling
            Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) - the former was preparing to marry
            her fiancee Michael (Alexander Skarsg&aring;rd) just before a mysterious
            rogue green planet (named Melancholia) was about to collide with
            Earth. Claire and her wealthy husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) were
            begrudgingly hosting and paying for the extravagant wedding reception
            for the late-arriving newlyweds at their remote, rural estate. Justine
            and Claire both belonged to a dysfunctional and unstable family,
            composed of estranged parents: hedonistic, self-involved father Dexter
            (John Hurt) and jaded, joyless mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling).
            Justine's greedy and ruthless boss Jack (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd)
            was Michael's best man. The story of the sisters was divided into
            two parts: Part 1: Justine, Part 2: Claire. During the awkward reception
            in Part 1, Justine increasingly alienated everyone and would disappear
            for lengths of time. She and kindred spirit Tim (Brady Corbet), boss
            Jack's ambitious nephew, had sex outdoors in a sand-trap. The wedding
            reception ended with Michael's departure after the newlyweds quietly
            called off the marriage, angering Claire and John and leaving Justine
            even more depressed. In Part 2, anxiety and apocalyptic fears grew
            as the planet Melancholia approached, especially for Claire. Nonetheless,
            Claire proposed to take in her worsening sister Justine after her
            marriage dissolution. Justine arrived and became more and more panic-stricken
            as the planet appeared to swing back and take a direct course toward
            Earth. Ominously, Claire's husband John died of a drug-overdose suicide
            - purposeful since as  an astronomy buff, he   fatalistically
            knew the end was near. As Justine also faced the prospect of  
            death, she was drawn to Claire's innocent and fearful young son Leo
            (Cameron Spurr), and comforted her nephew by proposing to build a
            teepee-shaped &quot;magic cave&quot; together
            with him on the golf course for refuge. The threesome of Claire,
            Leo, and Justine calmly, stoically and meditatively awaited the arrival
            of the destructive planet that obliterated the Earth.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Midnight in Paris (2011),</strong> 94 minutes,
            D. Woody Allen<br />
            Writer/director Woody Allen's  fantasy-based, charming  romantic
            comedy won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar award, and was the
            director's most profitable film to date in his career. It told the
            story of a young engaged couple traveling in 
             Paris who ultimately came to realize they had divergent objectives
            and mismatched goals in life. In the year 2010, successful Hollywood
            hack screenwriter Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) was accompanying his materialistic
            and pampered fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) while she was vacationing
            in Paris with her wealthy and conservative Republican parents, John
            and Helen (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) on a business trip. Jaded
            and disillusioned by Hollywood, Gil had ambitious, inspiring, fanciful
            dreams of moving to 1920s Paris to live the true life of an artist
            while struggling to write his debut novel about nostalgia, to the
            consternation of Inez who wanted to live in Malibu, CA and have a
            wealthy lifestyle. Although Inez enjoyed spending time with her ex-boyfriend
            - pedantic, pseudo-intellectual ex-professor Paul Bates (Michael
            Scheen)  and his girlfriend Carol (Nina Arianda), Gil decided to
            leave them one night and walk back to his hotel on his own. His nighttime
            stroll became an escapist trip back in time (at midnight) to the
            golden Jazz age of the Parisian 1920s, to meet up with legendary
            literati, musicians and artists of the &quot;Lost Generation,&quot; such as
            Cole Porter (Yves Heck), F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston
            and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Gertrude Stein
            (Kathy Bates), and others. On his second transported journey back
            in time at midnight, he became attracted to artist Pablo Picasso's
            (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) alluring lover/muse Adriana (Marion Cotillard),
            a costume designer, and they
            soon became enamoured of each other. However, Gil began to have confused
            and conflicted feelings about his present situation, leading Inez'
            suspicious father to hire a private detective (Gad Elmaleh) to track
            Gil's late-night whereabouts. At a book stall on the Seine River,
            Gil found Adriana's 1920's-era diary, and read how she had fallen
            in love with him. On another visit to the past, he confessed his
            own love for Adriana and they returned to the late 1800's Belle Epoque
            in France, her favorite earlier Golden Age with other prominent artists.
            However, Gil realized that despite his love, he must leave her there
            and return to the present. Back in 2010, he confronted Inez about
            sleeping with Paul, which she admitted, and promptly broke off their
            relationship, and decided to remain in Paris on his own. The film
            concluded with Gil's promising meet-up at midnight by the Seine with
            20's-era-loving antiques dealer Gabrielle (L&eacute;a
            Seydoux).</font></p>          </td>

            Bennett Miller<br />
            Based on  Michael Lewis' 2003 best-selling non-fiction book, this
          biographical sports film detailed the efforts of Billy Beane (Brad
            Pitt), the general manager of the Oakland Athletics baseball team
            at the end of the team's 2001 season (a defeat by the NY Yankees
            in the AL Division playoffs), to prepare for the upcoming year. He
            had suffered the loss of three major players who became free-agents,
            and needed to rebuild, but was hampered by a limited budget to recruit
            new team members. With the help of his new Yale-educated assistant
            general manager Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), an intelligent Economics
            major and statistics expert with novel and radical theories about
            how to determine the value and worth of a player's skill, Beane sought
            to build a team that could be competitive by relying on a different
            set of statistics regarding a player's on-base percentage. Although
            the team's head scout and other long-time scouts scoffed at the idea
            of using new computer-generated metrics, as did the A's manager Art
            Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the idea of recruiting undervalued,
            cheaper, and untapped players with great talent was implemented.
            At first, Howe wouldn't use the players that Beane brought on, and
            the strategy of bringing in no-name players appeared to be a major
            failure. However, manager Beane convinced the team's owner Stephen
            Schott (Bobby Kotick) to trust the new non-traditional and subversive
            method. Soon enough, the team started to win and had an impressive,
             record-breaking 20th consecutive win. They also clinched the 2002
            ALW (American League West) title, but lost to the Minnesota Twins
            in the AL Division series. Beane was vindicated two years later when
            his pioneering method (sabermetrics) became the winning model for
            the pennant-winning Red Sox in the 2004 World Series.</font></p>        </td>

            minutes, D: Simon Curtis<br />
          British writer/director Colin Clark had served as  23 year-old Third
           Assistant Director for director Sir Laurence Olivier's light-hearted
          romantic comedy <i>The
          Prince and the Showgirl (1957)</i>,
          also starring aging acting legend Olivier and Marilyn Monroe. He turned
          the experience into two accounts (diaries and memoir) about Marilyn
          (&quot;The Prince, the Showgirl and Me&quot; (1995) and &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot;
          (2000)) that became the basis for this show-biz drama's screenplay.
          During the making of the 1957 film in 1956, Clark (Eddie Redmayne)
          was intrigued and fascinated as he watched blonde Hollywood sex-icon
          actress Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), who was given the impossible task of taking
           the part originally played on-stage by Olivier's wife Vivien Leigh
          (Julia Ormond). She often showed her insecure,
          self-doubting and vulnerable side, and relied heavily on her Method
          Acting  coach, Paula Strasberg (Zo&euml; Wanamaker), or commiserations
          with her co-star Dame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench). She was often late
          to the set, regarded as uncooperative by the fearsome Olivier, and
          also forgetful of her lines. When Marilyn's newly-married, honeymooning
          playwright-husband Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) returned to the US
          when problems in their marriage surfaced and she felt abandoned, Clark
          spent more time with Marilyn. He befriended her and soon became her
          short-term trusted confidante and suitor. He escorted her around the
          London area, and at one time went skinny-dipping with her in the River
          Thames. They also flirtatiously kissed each other, and she invited
          him into her bedroom to lie next to her. Colin's budding romance with
          the production's wardrobe assistant Lucy (Emma Watson) soon ended due
          to his infatuation with Marilyn. However, Arthur returned and Marilyn
          attempted to reconcile with him, telling the broken-hearted but wiser

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Rango (2011),</strong> 107 minutes, D: Gore
            Verbinski<br />
            Director Gore Verbinski's non-Disney/Pixar computer-animated Western
            comedy won the year's Best Animated Feature Film Oscar. The title
            character was Rango (voice of Johnny Depp), an imaginative pet chameleon
            who ended up in the film's opening in the Mohave Desert. His terrarium
            (with his cozy inanimate companions including a headless Barbie,
            a dead insect, and a wind-up plastic fish) had accidentally fallen
            out of his owner's car on the highway. Rango was helped by Beans
            (voice of Isla Fisher), a female desert iguana who led him to her
            dusty hometown - the western outpost town of Dirt populated with
            anthromorphic animals. In the local saloon, Rango claimed he was
            a gunslinger. One of the town's inhabitants was Bad Bill (voice of
            Ray Winstone), a Gila monster outlaw, who was about to challenge
            Rango to a duel on the Main Street, but was scared off by a terrorizing
            red-tailed killer hawk. For his accidental defeat of the menacing
            hawk by flattening it with a water tower, the heroic Rango was offered
            the position of town Sheriff by the elderly desert tortoise mayor
            (voice of Ned Beatty). With the death of the hawk, it was then feared
            that gunslinger diamondback Rattlesnake Jake (voice of Bill Nighy)
            would return. The drought-suffering town was in desperate need of
            water (a scarce commodity kept in the town bank inside a large water
             jug) and a Sheriff. Unintentionally, Rango let the town's
            sole water supply be robbed by a trio of bank bandits, led by Balthazar
            (voice of Harry Dean Stanton), a mole. Rango formed a posse to retrieve
            the water bottle, and found it empty. After Rango was revealed to
            be lying with his exaggerated boasting,  he quit his job in disgrace
            and returned to the highway. There, he was convinced by the Spirit
            of the West or &quot;The Man
            With No Name&quot; (voice of Timothy Olyphant) to return to the town
            and right various wrongs. Ultimately, Rango discovered that the suspicious,
            manipulative and tyrannical Mayor was working in cahoots with Rattlesnake
            Jake, to make a profit by buying up the cheap dry land around Dirt,
            and manipulating the land prices by controlling the water supply
            valve on a pipeline from Las Vegas. Rango courageously returned to
            Dirt and successfully challenged the Mayor (who also double-crossed
            Jake), and was able to restore the town to the citizens.</font></p>          </td>

                az Simin)</b>, 123 minutes, D: Asghar Farhadi</font><br />
                <font size="2">Writer/director Asghar Farhadi's intensely absorbing
                 Iranian family drama ensemble film about marital difficulties
                and a miscarriage was the Academy Award winner for Best Foreign
                Language Film. In the opening scene set in an Iranian court of
                family law, a dysfunctional middle-class couple: husband Nader
                (Peyman Moaadi) and his educator wife Simin (Leila Hatami) argued
                their 'divorce' case before a judge. The couple had been planning
                to leave Iran to find a better life and educational opportunities
                for Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), their bright 11 year-old daughter.
                But their plans fell through when Nader decided to remain and
                care for his aging, senile, Alzheimer's-suffering father (Ali-Asghar
                Shabazi). Unable to
                resolve their dispute and compromise, Simin promptly sued her
                stubborn husband for a divorce. She lost the case, but still
                decided to separate and live with her parents, while Termeh remained
                with her father. Due to his work schedule, Nader was forced to
                hire a lower-class caregiver/housekeeper for his deteriorating
                father. He found a suitable but impoverished couple to nurse
                his father:  unstable, hot-headed shoe-repairer Hodjat (Shahab
                Hosseini) and his wife Razieh (Sareh Bayat), who showed up to
                work without her absent husband's permission. Nader was unaware
                that Razieh was five months pregnant and devoutedly religious
                (and would be fearful of violating her vows by seeing the nakedness
                of the incontinent father). One day when Nader returned home,
                he discovered his ailing father on the floor near death, and
                tied to a bedpost with Razieh nowhere in sight. Later when he
                confronted her, he became enraged and pushed her out of the apartment
                - causing her shortly later to have a miscarriage. Contentious
                arguments resulted when Hodjat accused Nader of causing the unborn
                child's death, while Nader countered with the accusation of neglect
                and mistreatment of his father. Strains in Nader's and Hodjat's
                families became even more pronounced as each protagonist pridefully
                held to his/her own egotistical views or deceptive lies, and
                everything disintegrated further. The film concluded with the
                family court declaring the marriage of Nader and Simin permanently
                separated. </font></p>          </td>

            Steve McQueen<br />
            This dark, chilling and highly provocative NC-17 rated sex addiction
            film from British director Steve McQueen was a powerful, non-judgmental
            drama about NYC businessman-yuppie Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender),
            who suffered from a serious problem or obsession - with compulsive
            sex, and the resultant shame and self-loathing. His
            rampant sex life included compulsive masturbation, short-term impersonal
            relationships, flirtation with homosexuality, the hiring of prostitutes,
            and addiction to Internet pornography (even at his place of work),
            including private web-cam chat sessions, and perusal of hardcore
            images (in magazines and videos). In the psychological drama, he
            struggled with his own issues and tried to keep his sexual needs
            a secret, although in one early scene in a bar, he circumvented his
            married, unfaithful boss David Fisher's (James Badge Dale) plan to
            pick up a woman at a club, and had sex with her on a quiet street.
            Shortly later, his disgusted boss discovered &quot;dirty&quot; pornography
            on Brandon's work computer hard drive.  At the
            same time, his wayward, estranged younger sister, Sissy Sullivan
            (Carey Mulligan), unexpectedly arrived from Los Angeles without warning
            to live with him. A professional musician and lounge singer from
            the same troubled and pathological family, she confronted him about
            his problems: (&quot;I'm
            trying to help you...We're family, we're meant to look after each
            other&quot;), and upset his need for privacy, while being emotionally damaged
              herself (with evidence of scars of self-inflicted suicidal scar
              wounds). She admitted: &quot;We're not bad people. We just come
              from a bad place.&quot; For example, in one single evening, Sissy
              had sex with David in Brandon's bedroom. After hearing them through
               the door, he left to go running (with headphones loudly playing Glenn Gould's interpretation
              of Bach's 'Aria from the Goldberg Variations'). Later that night,
              Sissy also attempted to get in bed with Brandon, but he ordered
              her back to the couch. Sissy's arrival completely upturned and
              interrupted Brandon's private sexual routines and practices when
              she found evidence of his sexual proclivities. He angrily reacted:
              (&quot;You come in here and you're a weight on me. Do you understand
              me? You're a burden. You're just dragging me down&quot;) and removed
              all of the pornography in his apartment, including his laptop.
              The film culminated with another attempt by Sissy to kill herself
              by bloodily slitting her wrists in his bathroom. This event shocked
              Brandon to his core, but would he be able, in the ambiguous ending,
              to rein in his out-of-control, insatiable urges and change his
              self-destructive behavior?</font></p>          </td>

            minutes, D: Tomas Alfredson<br />
            This suspenseful espionage film was adapted from  the 1974 spy novel
            by John Le Carr&eacute;  about a semi-retired ex-British agent  in
            London in 1973, during the bleak Cold War Era, who returned to hunt
            for and expose a Soviet KGB double agent (mole) in the British Secret
            Service (MI6). Le Carre's classic novel was also made into a TV-mini-series
            (with 7 episodes) in 1979, starring Alec Guinness. As the film opened,
            &quot;Control&quot; (Sir John Hurt) - the head of British Secret
            Intelligence Service (aka SIS or &quot;The Circus&quot;), was in
            charge of a failed operation in Budapest, Hungary to search for a
            mole in the British Service. It turned out to be a trap and Agent
            Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) was shot and captured (but was later released
            and in hiding). &quot;Control&quot; subsequently
            resigned along with his top-ranking assistant George Smiley (Gary
            Oldman) (aka &quot;Beggarman&quot;). A year later, veteran spy Smiley
            was called back into service to follow a complex trail to identify
            the mole after being informed by rogue MI6 field agent Ricki Tarr
            (Tom Hardy) about continuing suspicions of a double-agent mole within
            SIS. Smiley was assisted by Tarr's boss, young agent Peter Guillam
            (Benedict Cumberbatch) and retired Special Branch officer George
            Mendel (Roger Lloyd Pack), to root out the mole sharing secrets with
            the Soviets. Their most important lead came after agent Prideaux
            was located in hiding as a teacher in a school. He told Smiley about
            his failed Hungarian mission, and how &quot;Control&quot; had developed
            a list of five possible mole suspects passing intelligence to the
            Soviets. They all had code-names: Percy Alleline or &quot; Tinker&quot;
            (Toby Jones), Bill Haydon or &quot;Tailor&quot; (Colin Firth), Roy
            Bland or &quot;Soldier&quot; (Ciar&aacute;n
            Hinds), and Toby Esterhase or &quot;Poor Man&quot; (David Dencik).
            To Smiley's surprise, the fifth suspect was himself - &quot;Beggarman.&quot; The
            suspects regularly met at a safehouse in London with Alexei Polyakov
            (Konstantin Khabenskiy) (nicknamed &quot;Witchcraft&quot;), a Soviet
            cultural attach&eacute;, to exchange intelligence secrets. 
			Ultimately in the revelatory ending,
            the mole was identified as Bill Haydon, who had earlier conducted
            an affair with Smiley's wife Ann (Katrina Vasilieva) as a distraction
            and to divert suspicions away from himself. In the film's conclusion,
            Prideaux shot and killed Haydon who was in custody, as revenge for
            earlier betraying him in Hungary, and Smiley became the new head
            of &quot;The Circus.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

            D: Terrence Malick<br />
            Terence Malick's evocative, experimental family drama, told partially
            in non-linear flashback, was about an existential journey and crisis
            experienced both cosmically and personally. The impressionistic film's
            prologue opened with a Biblical quote from the Book of Job: Chapter
            38: verses 4,7 - a reference to the creator God's mysterious and
            wide universe: &quot;Where were you when I laid the foundations of the
            earth, when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God
            shouted for joy?&quot; The story centered around the subjective questing of an eldest son who
            grew up in a family of three sons in Waco, TX in 1956. Jack O'Brien
            (Hunter McCracken as boy, Sean Penn as adult) experienced a turbulent
            relationship with his dysfunctional, oppressive, bullying and strict
            disciplinarian father Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt), although his mother
            (Jessica Chastain) was more caring, outwardly loving and mothering.
            As a young man, Jack worked as an architect and often became disillusioned
            by life and felt lost in his middle-aged years. He often meditated,
            dreamed and contemplated the many mysteries of life, including viewing
            dreamscapes of the creation of the universe from a void, and the
            progressive evolution of life. A key event in his life as he reflected
            back was the tragic death of his younger brother R.L. (Laramie Eppler)
            who died at age 19 serving in the military. In
            the poetic film's hopeful epilogue with metaphorical imagery and
            visions, Jack began to see the miraculous nature of life, and was
            able to reconcile with his hard-working but unfulfilled, jaded and
            troubled father. He resolved his resentments and put aside the many
            turbulent disagreements to embrace his father with newfound love.</font></p>          </td>

            (2011),</strong> 117 minutes, D: Bill Condon<br />
            Five vampire-themed, fantasy romantic dramas  comprised this major
            film franchise, beginning with  <i>Twilight (2008)</i>, followed
            by the sequel <i>The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009)</i>,  <i>The
            Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010)</i>, <i>The Twilight Saga: Breaking
            Dawn - Part 1 (2011)</i>, and <i>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn
            - Part 2 (2012)</i>. The
          entire series was based on author Stephenie Meyer's four young-adult
            novels released from 2005-2008. The films followed
            the POV of teen Isabella &quot;Bella&quot; Swan
            (Kristen Stewart) who had moved to Forks,
            WA from AZ and had fallen in love with brooding, 104-year-old vampire
            Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). She also developed a rival romantic
            relationship with werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). As this
            fourth installment (Part 1) opened, Bella had just accepted Edward's
            proposal of marriage. Their marriage resulted in Bella and Edward
            finally consummating their love during an exotic honeymoon on the
             private island of  Isle Esme near Rio de Janiero in Brazil. The
            central event in the film was Bella's difficult, life-threatening,
            high-risk pregnancy and emergency C-section, followed by the bloody
            birth of a half-human, half-vampire immortal daughter named Renesmee.
            Ultimately, Bella was able to recover from a semi-dead state and
            was successfuly transformed into a vampire in order to survive, via
            Edward's venom injected into her heart. Jacob  imprinted on Renesmee
            and was able to see her bright future - and afterwards dedicated
            himself to be her protector and guardian. Part
            2 climaxed with a battle between the Cullens (and their allied Denali
            Clan of vegetarian vampires from Alaska, plus the pack of Jacob's
            wolves from the Quileute Tribe) against The Volturi, an ancient Italian
            vampire coven, who felt threatened by both Bella and her newborn
            child.</font></p>          </td>

            D: Jaume Collet-Serra<br />
          Jaume Collet-Serra's fast-paced, action-oriented psychological mystery-thriller
          was entirely set (and shot) in both parts of the reunified capital
          city of Berlin. Its intriguing premise - a crisis
          of stolen identity - occurred during Dr. Martin Harris' (Liam Neeson)
          business trip to the city to attend a biotechnology conference. When
          he took a taxi (driven by illegal Bosnian immigrant Gina (Diane Kruger),
          a diner worker) from the world-famous Hotel Adlon back to the airport
          to retrieve his forgotten briefcase, a car crash landed him in the
          Spree river and the local hospital, where he awoke four days later
          from a coma with his identity completely erased. The story's theme
          allegorically reflected the dichotomous suffering that the historic
          city of Berlin experienced during its many years of division. On a
          quest all around the city's neighborhoods and landmarks, the isolated
          man retraced his steps to discover who he was - trying to connect with
          the world he thought he belonged to. He was even accused of being an
          'imposter' when confronted by another 'Dr. Martin Harris' (Aidan Quinn)
          and his own wife Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; (January Jones) who claimed to not
          recognize him. He escaped from a hospital assassination attempt by
          a terrorist named Smith (Olivier Schneider) and went on the run, but
          soon found himself trapped in an absurd labyrinth within the foreign
          country. The victimized Dr. Harris contacted the taxi-cab driver and
          PI Ernst J&uuml;rgen (Bruno Ganz), an ex-Nazi STASI secret agent 
		  for assistance. He found himself in the midst of
          a terrorist conspiracy (from a group known as Section 15) to apparently
          assassinate liberal-minded Saudi Arabian Prince Shada (Mido Hamada)
          who was attending the biotechnology summit as a private funder of a
          secret research project being conducted by German bioscientist, Professor
          Bressler (Sebastian Koch). Identity-related twists and turns began
          to unsort when Dr. Harris discovered that his name was only a 'cover
          persona', created by himself. An 'imposter' replacement had been activated
          and joined his wife after she reported his accident and coma. [Liz
          had been compelled to go along with the identity-switch and betray
          him.] He also recalled a visit to Berlin three months earlier with
          Liz, when they both acted as government assassins and planted a bomb
          in Prince Shada's hotel suite. Dr. Harris now made every effort to
          thwart the impending assassination plot and convinced the authorities
          to evacuate the hotel. In the conclusion, the target of the terrorist
          group was determined to be Harris' academic friend Professor Bressler
          to obtain his secret research results (about a stronger strain of genetically-modified
          corn to combat world hunger). The killing could then be blamed on Muslim
          extremists opposed to the Prince. Liz's efforts to disarm the bomb
          failed and resulted in her death, while Dr. Harris killed his Section
          15 terrorist 'imposter' to save Bressler's life. The next day, the
          Prince and Bressler announced the research results would be free to
          the world, and Harris with his newfound ally Gina departed from Berlin,
          with fake passports, new identities (Henry and Claudia Taylor), and
          thousands of euros in cash (the contents of the briefcase).</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>War Horse (2011)</strong>, 146 minutes, D:
            Steven Spielberg<br />
            Director Spielberg's lengthy, sentimental coming-of-age, family war
            drama was an adaptation of the 1982 novel by Michael Morpurgo 
          and its  hit 2007 Broadway stage adaptation. It told an intense
            tale, set in the early 1900s during WWI, about the close bond that
            developed between strong-willed British teen Albert Narracott (Jeremy
            Irvine) and a beautiful bay thoroughbred horse
            named Joey that he raised from birth in Devon, England,
            after purchasing the newborn colt at an auction. The purchase incensed
            the Narracott's cruel landlord/neighbor Mr.
            Lyons (David Thewlis) who was outbid. Albert trained the horse to
            plow the rocky field of their family's crops. But then following
            a massive flood that wiped out the farmland, and with no money for
            overdue rent, Albert's Boer War veteran father Ted Narracott (Peter
            Mullan) was forced - in 1914, the opening year of the Great War -
            to sell off Joey to earnest British Army cavalry Captain James Nicholls
            (Tom Hiddleston). The film followed the war years as Joey was transferred
            from one owner to the next in war-torn Europe, and even switched
            sides. Eventually by 1918, Albert was old enough to enlist in the
            British Army and began a search while serving on the front lines,
            but suffered temporary blindness after a gas explosion. While recuperating,
            Albert learned of the location of his beloved but severely-injured
            Joey who had become  entangled in barbed wire in 'no mans-land'.
            Albert  was able to save his horse from being euthanized, but was
            not able to take possession. At the end of the war,
            Joey was ordered to be auctioned off and was won by a higher bid
            made by one of Joey's earlier owners. However, the sympathetic and
            kindly grandfather (Niels Arestrup) gave up the horse to Albert in
            the emotional conclusion.</font></p>          </td>
