              minutes, D: Frank Capra<br />
            Frank Capra's  hilariously-funny, frantic farce and black comedy
            was a frenzied adaptation of the smash Broadway comedy from 1941
            to 1944. Three of the original stage performers reprised
            their roles in the film. Set around Halloween night in Brooklyn,
            NY, mild-mannered drama critic Mortimer Brewster's
            (Cary Grant) two sweet, old loveable spinster aunts: Martha and Abby
            (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair) in Brooklyn, NY, were revealed to
            be secretly poisoning old male bachelors with homemade elderberry
            wine (spiked with arsenic); the crazed ladies were assisted by Mortimer's
            insane brother &quot;Teddy Roosevelt&quot; Brewster (John Alexander)
            who was burying the bodies of many poisoned male victims in the cellar
            (following a Christian funeral). Teddy  kept saying that he  was
              digging cellar graves for Panama Canal yellow fever victims who
              had perished.  Teddy
          regularly charged up the stairs with a bugle in hand, as if fighting
          the Spanish-American War. Hapless nephew Mortimer, just
              recently married with a frustrated new wife Elaine Harper (Priscilla
              Lane) - the minister's daughter who lived next door, discovered
            what was going on when he found a dead body in the window seat -
            and there were twelve more in the basement. When he opened the window
            seat-box twice - a great double-take - he suddenly realized that
            there was a dead body in there. To
            be responsible, Mortimer thought that only his brother was responsible,
          and wanted to get him safely committed, never even suspecting his two
              aunts. Mr. Witherspoon (Edward Everett Horton), the director of
            the Happydale Sanitorium rest home was reluctant to accept Teddy,
            because he already had too many &quot;Roosevelts.&quot; Mortimer
            was also confronted by the unexpected arrival of an insane pair:
            his sinister, psychotic serial murderer older brother on the lam,
            Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey in the film, Boris Karloff on stage)
            (resembling Frankenstein) who had a victim's body (his twelfth) of
            his own to dispose of. Jonathan was accompanied by another villainous
            companion, his alcoholic assistant - plastic surgeon Dr. Hermann
            Einstein (Peter Lorre). The two plotted to make Mortimer their 13th
            victim and they tied him up, but he was saved by the arrival of policemen
            to take Teddy away to Happydale, who luckily recognized Jonathan's
            face and arrested him. Mortimer was frantic about the possibility
            of his own genetic predisposition to mental illness, but was completely
            relieved  when he finally discovered from his two aunts
          that he wasn't an insane Brewster family member after all (earlier,
          he had told Elaine that their marriage was problematic: &quot;Insanity
            runs in my family; it practically gallops&quot;) - his mother was
            the family cook and his father had been a chef on a steamship: &quot;You're
            not really a Brewster...Your mother came to us as a cook. And you
            were born about three months afterwards. And she was such a sweet
            woman and such a good cook. We didn't want to lose her so brother
            married her. Your real father was a cook too. He was a chef on a
            tramp steamer.&quot; The overjoyed Mortimer
              yelled at his newly-wed wife Elaine from a window about his real
              heritage: &quot;Elaine, Elaine,
              Where are you? Can you hear me? I'm not really a Brewster. I'm
              a son of a sea cook!&quot; [Note: His words were
              censored from &quot; I'm a bastard!&quot; to &quot;I'm a son
              of a sea cook!&quot;] Elaine made the hysterical discovery in the
              cellar of bodies, yelling out: &quot;It's true. I guess there are
              13 bodies down there!&quot; as Mortimer tried to silence her. Before
              their departure for their honeymoon to Niagara Falls, Mortimer
              exultantly exclaimed to the cab-driver: &quot;I'm the son of a
              sea-cook&quot;; he charged away
              with Elaine draped over his shoulder. The astonished cab-driver
              responded after them with the film's final line: &quot;I'm not
              a cab driver. I'm a coffee pot.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              This eccentric and lyrical UK film was advertised with the tagline:
              &quot;Four modern pilgrims in a story of today - yet away from
              war.&quot;
              The story, set in the summer of 1943 during the early years of
              WWII, began with three individuals (or pilgrims) arriving, during
              a blackout, in the small Kent village of Chillingbourne in Southern
              England, enroute toward Canterbury: (1) Alison Smith (Sheila Sim)
              a London department store salesgirl who was about to become a &quot;Land
              Girl&quot;
              in the Women's Land Army, (2) US Army Sgt. Bob Johnson (John Sweet),
              a GI serviceman on leave, and (3) cynical Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price),
              a drafted Englishman and former cinema-organist who gave up his
              music school dreams. As they departed the train and entered town
              after dark, a strange nocturnal &quot;Glue Man&quot; poured sticky
              glue into Alison's hair - she was his 11th victim. As they investigated
              the incident, they became suspicious of the eccentric local magistrate,
              Thomas Colpeper JP (Eric Portman), also a farmer whom Alison was
              to begin working with. They also studied the history of the area
              and tales of The Pilgrim's Way, and attended Colpeper's lantern-slide
              lecture. By the film's conclusion once they reached Canterbury
              (in a modern-day pilgrimage) about a ten minute journey away by
              train, Colpeper had admitted to being the Glue Man - with good
              intentions - to assure that local girls wouldn't go out at night
              with GIs and forsake their husbands and boyfriends, and to hopefully
              guarantee that they would learn about the area's history. Each
              of the three pilgrims also miraculously received a blessing in
              Canterbury and were changed forever. Both Alison and Bob, who feared
              that their missing fiancee/girlfriend was dead, located their
              loved ones. And Peter Gibbs played the organ in Canterbury's mystical
              cathedral.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Billy Wilder<br />
            Billy Wilder's  suspense/thriller was one
            of the greatest, darkest film noirs of all time, and one of the best
            films of the 40s. Its brilliant script was based on the 1943 crime
            novel by James M. Cain, written by Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder.
            In the novel, the main characters were named Walter Huff and Phyllis
            Nirdlinger. Told in a flashback by the seriously-wounded protagonist
            (with a tense voice-over narration), insurance salesman Walter Neff
            (Fred MacMurray) fell hard for blonde-wigged, sexy housewife Phyllis
            Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) with a sexy anklet. The femme fatale
            enticed him into a scheme to murder her husband, in order to fraudulently
            collect a double indemnity accident policy pay-off. Claims agent
            Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), a perceptive, dogged co-worker
            in Walter's insurance company, became suspicious and unraveled the
            case. In the uncompromising ending, the two lovers plotted against
            each other and ended up trying to kill each other.</font></p>          </td>

            George Cukor's  classic, lavishly glossy, pseudo-Victorian thriller
            from MGM was a remake of director Thorold Dickinson's shorter and
            more faithful <i>Gaslight
            (1940)</i>,
            with Anton Walbrook and Diana Wynyard, which MGM unsuccessfully tried
            to destroy to avoid competition. [Note: It was called <i>Angel
            Street</i>          when it played on Broadway beginning in late
            1941, with Vincent Price in the villainous role. Patrick Hamilton's
            famous play originally opened on the stage in London in 1939.] In
            London, Paula Alquist (Best Actress Oscar-winner Ingrid Bergman),
            a wealthy, vulnerably-innocent socialite married a charming ne'er-do-well,
            urbane, worldly Londoner Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer). She was convinced
            to move into her murdered Aunt's ancestral home. (Anton killed the
            Aunt years earlier). He was determined to drive his wife Paula mad
            to obtain her inheritance - obsessed with finding her Aunt's hidden
            jewelry in their house. The menacing Anton methodically victimized
            and terrorized his wife by playing upon her memory lapses and by
            tricking her with dimming gaslights and unsettling sounds from the
            attic, until savvy Scotland Yard detective Brian Cameron (Joseph
            Cotten) entered the case and realized Paula was deliberately being
            tormented. The saucy, teenage maid Nancy Oliver was 17 year-old Angela
            Lansbury in a supporting role - her film debut.</font></p></td>

            Amazingly, this classic Bing Crosby film was a major box-office hit
                (the top-grossing film of the year) - and a Best Picture winner.
                It was followed by the sequel, <em>The
                Bells of St. Mary's (1945)</em>. In the heartwarming, sentimental
                story, young, personable, progressive, down-to-earth priest
                Father Chuck O'Malley (Bing Crosby)  worked in a poor New
                York slum Catholic parish - the financially-struggling St. Dominic's
                Church. He sought to win over his strict, loveable, but crusty,
                conservative old parish priest Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald,
                uniquely nominated for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor,
                winning the latter) and to teach a group of street kids responsibility
                and respect by organizing  a boys choir. Crosby's
                songs included the incomparable &quot;Swinging
        on a Star&quot; (Oscar-winning), &quot;Ave Maria,&quot; &quot;Three Blind
        Mice&quot; (sung with
        the boys' choir)  and

            This fast paced, daring, and zany  Paramount Studios satire on war-time
            patriotism and hysteria, human nature, motherhood, and hero-worship
            came from the creative mind of writer/producer/director Preston Sturges.

            screen performance), ashamed and embarrassed to admit his lack of
            fitness for duty, masqueraded as a soldier - he worked in a shipyard
            but wrote deceptive letters home telling of his military exploits.
            He allowed a group of sympathetic soldiers on board a train to pass
            him off as a true war hero, to deceive his hometown folks when he
            returned home in a great homecoming sequence, complete with brass
            bands. In the small town of Oakridge, Woodrow was &quot;hailed as
            the conquering hero&quot; and lauded for his bravery
          at Guadalcanal.  Woodrow's former girlfriend Libby (Ella
          Raines) was now engaged to Forrest Noble (Bill Edwards) (also discharged
          for hay fever). Woodrow was ashamed to renew their love (he told 
          her that he had met someone else). After a sleepless night, Woodrow
          confessed to all the falsehoods, and to his surprise, he was commended
          for his courage, and he won back his girlfriend. </font><font size="2">The

          the Fift with His Battell Fought at Agincourt in France)</strong>,
          136 minutes, D: Laurence Olivier<br />
          Actor/director Laurence Olivier's triumphant, colorful, costume drama/spectacle
          of the 15th century monarch  marked the first screen adaptation of
          William Shakespeare's classic, timeless and immortal epic play. Olivier
          was given an Honorary Oscar as actor, producer and director in bringing <em>Henry
            V</em> to the silver screen. It also received
            four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture,
            Best Actor (Laurence Olivier), Best Color Art Direction-Interior
            Decoration, and Best Music Score (William Walton). </font><font size="2">It
            was remade by director/star Kenneth Branagh as <i>Henry
              V (1989, UK) </i>covering the same play and the same level of directorial
            ability and a similar level of acting skill by the ensemble cast.
            
            The nature of both films was deeply affected by the historical context
            in which they were created. Both were about young, 15th century,
            28 year-old Plantagenet Prince of Wales (Laurence Olivier) who
            decided to act on his claim to the French throne by invading France,
            and won a victory at the crucial Battle of Agincourt against a
            larger, vastly superior French force. The
              story was told by actor/director Laurence Olivier (in his directorial
              debut, who also starred, co-produced, and co-adapted the script)
              in Technicolor (aka <em>The
                Chronicle History of King Henry the Fift with His Battell Fought
                at Agincourt in France</em>) - the first radical reinterpretation
              of the play. Innovatively staged, it was intimate and theatrical
              (the film opened on a bare Elizabethan stage, the Globe Theater,
              in the style of a play in the 1600s, and then expanded outward
              from there). The narrative then shifted to an epic film format
              shot on-location with sweeping, technicolor battle scenes. The
              film was chiefly about royal responsibility, war and its effects.
              The film was deeply affected by the historical context in which
              it was created -- Olivier had intended <em>Henry V</em> to
              be a rallying morale booster for Britain at the height of WWII.
              Highlights included Henry V's pre-battle speech to his troops at
              the siege of Harfleur, from Act III, Scene 1, beginning with the
              stirring line: &quot;Once
              more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; or close the wall
              up with our English dead,&quot;   and
              his St. Crispin's Day address to his battle-weary men, from Act
              IV, Scene 3,   &quot;We
              few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he today that sheds
              his blood with me shall be my brother.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

            Otto Preminger's gripping, moody, stylish murder mystery was a classic,
            complex <i>film
            noir</i> and tale of romance  based on the
            1943 novel by Vera Caspary. 
            The film contained unsettling, obsessive undertones of voyeurism
            and ghoulish necrophilia. With both </font><font size="2">sharp
            and witty dialogue, and  a great ensemble group of character actors,
            it was an Academy Award winner for  Best Black/White Cinematography.
            It also featured the haunting melody of the title theme
            song, David Raskin's &quot;Laura.&quot; It opened with the voice
            of a prissy, acerbic, cynical newspaper columnist named Waldo Lydecker
            (Clifton Webb) (purportedly based upon columnist, broadcaster, and <i>The
              New Yorker</i> theater
            critic Alexander Woollcott) who unfolded the story in
            flashbacks. Street-wise police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews)
            investigated the shotgun slaying/murder of a beautiful young socialite
            Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) - her face had been blown away. During
            his interviews and work on the case, he became personally absorbed
            in the details of the young woman's life and found himself irresistibly
            falling in love with a large portrait of the mysterious victim and
            his pieced-together image of her. The detective's earthy directness
            and toughness was contrasted to the smug, pseudo-intellectualism
            of the victim's upper crust, socially-prominent friends in Manhattan,
            including Laura's mentor Lydecker, and Laura's fiancee - an effeminate
            gigolo named Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). It was revealed that
            the murdered girl was not Laura, but Diana Redfern, after Laura returned
            from a long weekend. In the exciting conclusion, enraged and jealous
            Lydecker (who had killed Diana) threatened Laura with a shotgun (originally
            hidden in a clock) in her apartment with a murder/suicide, but was
            felled by police. He expired with the words: &quot;Goodbye, Laura.

            Novelist John Steinbeck co-scripted the film's adapted screenplay
                with American scripter Jo Swerling, basing it on his 100 page
                unpublished novella. This World War II melodrama/thriller was
                an interesting, visually-arresting, penetrating study of human
                nature and class distinctions under pressure. This was the
                only film that Hitchcock made for Twentieth Century Fox Studios.
                Hitchcock's famed cameo was ingenious - he appeared in before
                and after photos in a newspaper ad for a dieting product. The
                action was contained entirely aboard one small cramped lifeboat
                in the North Atlantic, as a group of castaway survivors of a
                torpedoed freighter struggled together. [Note: The film was shot
                entirely on a restricted set - on a boat in a large studio tank.]
                All came from the same Allied boat, sunk by a German submarine/U-boat,
                except for one rescued German (the captain of the sunken U-boat
                or submarine that had attacked). Sharp characterizations were
                developed between the surviving characters from various backgrounds
                who suspensefully clashed and conspired with each other:  chic,
                spoiled, and self-centered fashion journalist  Constance
                'Connie' Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), a tough proletarian seaman
                of Czech ancestry John Kovak (John Hodiak), and the devious German
                captain of the U-boat Willy (Walter Slezak) who cleverly manipulated
                them to his own advantage as helmsman of the lifeboat. In fact,
                he seemed to be the only one among them that had a
                plan for survival. When the group finally discovered Willy's
                deceptions and cruelty (he killed injured, amputee seaman Gus
                Smith (William Bendix) and was hoarding water), they beat him
                to death and threw him overboard - while lamenting:
                &quot;What do you do with people like that?&quot;  When
                the group was finally awaiting rescue by an allied warship,
                they had to make a decision about saving another young, wounded
                German survivor. </font></p></td>

          Technicolored film reestablished star Judy Garland's career - and set
          her up to become director Minnelli's future wife. The
          nostalgic, romantic, fanciful, heartwarming film, told in a series
          of seasonal vignettes (beginning with the Summer of 1903), was the
          story of the upper-middle-class Smith family in turn-of-the-century
          St. Louis in the year before the 1904 World's Fair. The action throughout
              the film surrounded the emotions which erupted in the happy Smith
              family, a typically-idealized Americana family group, with the
          startling news of the family's impending move to New York due to father
          Alonzo Smith's (Leon Ames) job transfer. They would stay through Christmas
              and then move. Mrs. Anna Smith (Mary Astor)
              and the four daughters and son included red-haired eldest daughter
              Rose (Lucille Bremer), second-eldest Esther (Judy Garland), young
              Agnes (Joan Carroll), and the precocious, morbid youngest daughter &quot;Tootie&quot; (Margaret
            O'Brien), and Princeton University-bound Alonzo (or &quot;Lon&quot;) Jr.
              (Henry H. Daniels, Jr.). The girls steadfastly wanted to remain
              in St. Louis, especially because of their possible romantic futures
              with boyfriends. Rose had a beau back East named Warren Sheffield
              (Robert Sully), and Esther was in love with handsome  
               boy next door John Truett (Tom Drake). Esther sang most
              of the film's sentimental songs, including &quot;The
            Boy Next Door,&quot; &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; 
          and &quot;The Trolley Song&quot; (sung in late summer aboard the trolley departing
          for a look at the future St. Louis fairgrounds). In the Autumn 1903
          segment, during Halloween trick-or-treating, costumed rascal Tootie
          was engaged in an incident when she lied and claimed John had attacked
          her. At first, Esther retaliated against John, but then had to reconcile
          with him after Tootie confessed the truth. In the Winter 1903 segment,
          an elegant Christmas Ball was the occasion for John to ask for Esther's
          hand in marriage. Tootie, however, was forlorn about the impending
          move, and although partly comforted when Esther sang to her: &quot;Have
          Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; she expressed her sadness by running
          into the backyard to destroy her snowman. In the film's upbeat
          ending, Mr. Smith (who realized the family's devastating upset) announced
          that because of the pain he had caused by proposing a
          move, he had changed his mind. He decided that the family would not
          leave St. Louis after all. At the same time, Warren arrived to propose
          to Rose. In the final short segment, Spring 1904, the family (and various
          suitors) arrived at the fairgrounds for the opening of the St. Louis
          Exposition. </font></p>        </td>

              D: Preston Sturges<br />
            This delightful Paramount film has been rated as one of director/writer
            Preston Sturges' top war-time screwball comedies (although not as
            successful as <i><a href="ladye.html">The Lady Eve (1941)</a></i> or <i><a href="palm.html">The
            Palm Beach Story (1942)</a></i>). Writer/director Frank Tashlin's
            loose remake <i>Rock-A-Bye
            Baby (1958)</i>  with Jerry Lewis was
            based on this film. It was considered a defiant, daring, controversial,
            bold, irreverent farce at the time due to its scandalous content.
            It outraged the Production Code Office for its skewering of marriage,
            parenthood, motherhood and the nuclear family, as well as a small
            town's political machine, while also containing Sturges' characteristic
            touches - fast-delivered dialogue and slapstick. A hapless, small-town
            American girl from Morgan's Creek (a fictitious place), flirty blonde
            Trudy Kockenlocker (Betty Hutton) (still considered a minor at under
            21 years of age) attended a rollicking, all-night farewell party
            with servicemen from the local army base, got drunk, and married
            a soldier. She soon found herself pregnant, but couldn't remember <i>which</i> soldier
            she had married - was his name something like &quot;Ignatz Ratzkiwatzki...or
          was it Zitzkiwitzki&quot;? She  feared  the reaction of her strict,
          ineffectual, exasperated and overprotective father - peace officer
          Constable Kockenlocker (William Demarest). With the conniving advice
          of her shrewd, younger 14 year-old teenaged sister Emmy (Diana Lynn),
          the assertive mother-to-be convinced average country bumpkin and physical
          wreck - bank-clerk/4-F reject Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken), Trudy's
          sympathetic childhood boyfriend, to marry her (to legitimize her pregnancy
          and pretend to be the father). The dense, love-struck Norval made a
          crucial error when he signed his real name on the marriage certificate,
          and he faced arrest on 19 counts (forgery, false impersonation of soldier
          Ratzkiwatzki, corrupting the morals of a minor, even bank robbery and
          kidnapping). Before the frantic film ended, Trudy 'miraculously'
              gave birth - revealed in stages - to sextuplets (six baby boys)
              on Christmas Day, and Norval was given assistance by Governor McGinty
              (Brian Donlevy) and The Boss (Akim Tamiroff) (both actors and characters
              from Sturges' previous film <i>The
              Great McGinty (1940)</i>).
            McGinty ordered Norval pardoned and released from jail, declared
              him and Trudy married (retroactively), promoted Norval into the
              National Guard as a colonel, and made Trudy's father police chief.
              The young couple became national celebrities, but Norval (now a
              town hero!) fainted when he learned he was the father of six offspring:
              (&quot;But Norval recovered and became increasingly happy for, as Shakespeare
              said: 'Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have
          greatness thrust upon them.'&quot;)</font></p>        </td>

              <font size="2">Scripters Philip and Julius Epstein based their
                  screenplay on the same-named 1940 novel by Elizabeth von Arnim.
                  This Warner Bros.' historical drama was named after the shrewd
                  and intelligent title character Job Skeffington (Claude Rains),
                  a self-made Jewish financier. His  wife was the beautiful
                  but vain, callous, and self-centered Frances Beatrice 'Fanny'
                  Trellis (Bette Davis). She arranged to be lovelessly married
                  to Skeffington to save her indebted, wastrel, swindling brother
                  Trippy Trellis (Richard Waring), who worked for Skeffington,
                  from going to prison for embezzlement of funds from the Skeffington
                  Bank. The film opened in the year 1914 in NYC, where earlier,
              the single and flirtatious belle Fanny, with many male suitors,
              was close to her cousin George Trellis (Walter Abel), while also
              having an unhealthy attachment to her brother Trippy. Due to Trippy's
                  anti-Semite prejudice, and his outrage and anger at his sister's
                  poor marital choice of a husband (&quot;I despise Mrs. Skeffington!&quot;),
                  Trippy left the US to fight in the Lafayette Escadrille (the
                  British Air Corps) during World War I. At the same time that
                  Fanny was pregnant with Skeffington's child, she received the
                  devastating news that Trippy was killed in action in France.
                  After the birth of her female child (also named Fanny), Mrs.
                  Skeffington continued her old lifestyle, as if she wasn't either
                  married or a mother, by entertaining admiring male suitors
                  and ignoring both her husband and young daughter. After the
                  war ended, Skeffington ultimately decided to divorce his promiscuous
                  wife, and she acquired a large settlement. Young Fanny (Marjorie
                  Riordan) moved to Europe to live with her mother's estranged
                  husband. However, with the advent of WWII there, Job sent his
                  grown daughter back to the US to live with his divorced wife
                  for safety's sake. Fanny felt her daughter was in the way of
                  her courtship with her latest lover Johnny Mitchell (Johnny
                  Mitchell), a young engineer, even though Fanny wouldn't admit
                  that her physical beauty had deteriorated with age. While on
                  a sailing trip with Mitchell, Fanny contracted diptheria and
                  although she recovered, she was ravaged by the illness and
                  her own advanced aging, and looked extremely haggard and withered.
                  Mitchell instead chose to fall in love and marry the young
                  Fanny, and moved away to Seattle with her. In the film's dramatic
                  conclusion, Fanny reluctantly agreed with George to meet with
                  her ill and penniless ex-husband, who had suffered under the
                  Nazis as a Jew and returned from Europe. In her front parlor,
                  she saw that Job was blind when he stumbled and could not see
                  her dissipated beauty. After she decided to take him in (she
                  announced: &quot;You're
                  safe now, home with me...Mr. Skeffington has come home&quot;),
                  George exclaimed to her: &quot;I've never seen you look more
                  beautiful.&quot; She
                  finally realized how short-sighted she was, and decided to
                  nurse Job for the remainder of their lives - remembering what
                  Job had once said to her, and responding to George: &quot;A
                  woman is beautiful only when she's loved. Isn't that right,
                  Job?&quot; </font><br />

              Dmytryk<br />
            This great film was originally released under the title <i>Farewell,
            My Lovely</i>,
            although changed so that fans of 30s musical crooner and dance
            star Dick Powell, portraying the main character, wouldn't think the
            film was a musical comedy. This film marked the earliest screen depiction
            of detective Philip Marlowe. [Note: Philip Marlowe was introduced
             in 1939 in Chandler's first novel <i>The Big Sleep</i>, which was
            made into <a href="bigs.html"><i>The Big Sleep (1946)</i></a> feature
            film with Humphrey Bogart in the role.] This film was remade with
            the original title,  <i>Farewell,
            My Lovely (1975)</i> starring Robert
            Mitchum. The tales were adapted from Raymond Chandler's 1940 hard-boiled
            novel - a superb, complex, shadowy film noir of murder, corruption,
            blackmail, double-cross and double identity, with witty dialogue
            and cynical, descriptive voice-over narration. The convoluted film
            opened in wartime Los Angeles, where tough yet vulnerable, blindfolded/bandaged
             gumshoe detective Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell in a dramatic role
            switch) was grilled under a bright light by police interrogators
            about murders committed with his gun. In flashback (almost the entire
            film), he told a disorienting and bewildering tale. He had been hired
            by recently-released, brutish, urgent ex-con Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki)
            to search for his missing girlfriend Velma Valento (Claire Trevor)
            from 8 years earlier. And then in a seemingly unrelated case, he
            was also commissioned as a bodyguard, for $100 to accompany an effeminate
            man Lindsay Marriott (Douglas Walton) (associated with shady underworld
            figure Jules Amthor (Otto Kruger)) during a ransom payoff of $8,000
            for allegedly stolen jade necklace (the film's MacGuffin). Marriott
            was killed, and Marlowe was knocked unconscious. The owner of the
            necklace,  mysterious, flirtatious <i>femme fatale</i> Mrs. Helen
            Grayle (Trevor again) hired Marlowe to locate her allegedly stolen
            jade necklace (not actually stolen in the end) worth $100,000, originally
            given to her by her older wealthy, and often jealous husband Mr.
            Grayle (Miles Mander). Marlowe was also trying to determine who murdered
            Marriott. During the case, Marlowe met Ann (Anne Shirley in her final
            film), Mrs. Grayle's pretty red-haired stepdaughter who detested
            her promiscuous stepmother, and wished to protect her father. Marlowe
            continued to navigate through a perilous world, becoming further
            entangled with and threatened by despicable high- and low-class criminals.
            During a meeting with Amthor, Marlowe was knocked cold by the butt
            of Amthor's gun. He
            experienced drug-induced hallucinations and nightmares (&quot;a
            crazy, coked-up dream&quot;)
            after being  pursued through a series of identical
            doors by a white-coated Dr. Sonderborg (Ralf Harolde) with a giant
            hypodermic needle, during three days of imprisonment in a strange
            sanitarium. After escaping, he became the prime suspect for Marriott's
            murder and for the theft of the jade necklace while continuing to
            conduct his own investigation. He also became embroiled when he found
            Amthor  in his Hollywood penthouse with a snapped neck - obviously
            committed by the brutish Moose Malloy. Although Marlowe's two cases
            were confusing, they were both linked by one person - Velma and Mrs.
            Grayle (the same individual). What followed were two scenes in the
            Grayle beach house, the first when Helen tried to seduce Marlowe
            and convince him to help her murder Amthor (who was already dead).
            There was also a final standoff and violent shoot-out, when it was
            confirmed that mysterious, flirtatious, gold-digging double-identity
            Mrs. Helen Grayle - also known as Moose's missing Velma, had set
            up numerous individuals over the theft of her jade necklace. She
            was indeed a murderous <i>femme
            fatale - </i>she was the one who had murdered Marriott. The jealous
            Mr. Grayle shot Helen dead (with Marlowe's gun), and Moose in anger
            retaliated - and both Moose and Mr. Grayle also ended up dead. Marlowe
            was temporarily blinded by gunshot powder close to his face. In the
            film's ending back in the present after Marlowe's tale ended and
            he was declared not-guilty, he was reunited with cute love interest
            Ann in the back of a taxi-cab.</font></p>          </td>

            MGM's greatest children's/family films launched  Elizabeth
            Taylor's career, in her first starring role. This </font><font size="2"> all-time,
            loveable, dramatic film favorite in Technicolor also launched
            co-star Mickey Rooney, who much later starred in a similar role in <i>The
            Black Stallion (1979)</i>.
            This film was remade as <i>International Velvet (1978)</i> starring
            Tatum O'Neal. The screenplay by American screenwriter Helen Deutsch
            was based on the 1935 novel by Enid Bagnold. It was the poignant
            and uplifting story of a plucky young daughter in Sussex, England,
            the middle child in the Brown family, headed by a pragmatic butcher
            Mr. Brown (Donald Crisp) and his strong, plain-spoken and observant
            wife (Ann Revere). In the 1920s, young horsewoman Velvet Brown (12
            year-old Elizabeth Taylor) won a neighbor's unruly, spirited and
            wild horse named &quot;The Pie&quot; in a village raffle-lottery.
            Determined, she trained the horse with the coaching help of a homeless,
            embittered, ex-jockey Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney) to enter the famed
            Grand National Steeplechase Race. (Mi continued to feel responsible
            for an accident that had killed a jockey.) Against everyone's wishes
            and impossible odds, Velvet replaced her jockey Taski (Eugene Loring)
            and, in disguise as a male rider, she took charge of her own horse
            and won the race in the exciting, beautifully-edited conclusion.
            However, she was disqualified after crossing the winning line, because
            she fainted and fell off her horse. Upon their return to the village,
            they were honored and greeted ceremoniously. One of many offers for
            appearances and interviews was to have Velvet and Pie travel to Hollywood
            to star in a motion picture - but she rejected the idea.</font></p>          </td>

            melo-drama of Richard Llewelyn's 1943 novel - it was Odets' directorial
            and scripting debut. Cary Grant's indomitable performance in the
            depressing drama earned him his sole Oscar nomination - his straightest
            dramatic role in his entire career, although he believed he was miscast.
            The film turned out to be a flop for RKO Studios. In London's East

            romantic interest in gangster friend Jim Mordinoy's (George Coulouris)
            fickle ex-wife Ada Brantline (June Duprez). (Later, he learned that
            she had a baby daughter from her marriage). When Ernie learned
            that his poverty-stricken, widowed mother Ma Mott (Ethel Barrymore),
            the proprietor of a second-hand furniture shop/pawn shop, was
            terminally ill and dying of cancer - he returned home. He became
             a devoted son and his spirit was semi-transformed when he helped
            run the shop and care for Ma. However, his mother began to also
            get involved with Ernie's wayward crime friends, including shoplifter
            Mrs. Jane Snowden (Queenie Vassar). After being tempted, she agreed
            to fence stolen goods for the shoplifter, to help raise money for
            her poor family. At the same time, 
            Ernie continued to be engaged in criminal activities with his companions
            - mostly car-theft. During one altercation with police following
            a crime, they searched him and found a platinum cigarette case -
            he claimed it was given to him by his mother as a birthday gift.
            The item was traced and found to be stolen goods. In the film's tragic
            conclusion, the dying Ma was arrested and jailed. She begged
             Ernie's forgiveness for disgracing the Mott family name before
            dying in prison. Ernie was forlorn after Ada decided 
            to return to her ex-husband, so he ventured out to find Aggie.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: John Cromwell<br />
            This big-budget, sentimental soap opera told about a genteel,
            idealized Midwestern family that was left on the home front in 1943
            during World War II. At the time, it was the longest and most expensive
            Hollywood film since producer David O. Selznick's own <i><a href="gone.html">Gone
            with the Wind (1939)</a></i>.
            Selznick also wrote the screenplay, based upon Margaret Buell Wilder's
            1943 novel: &quot;Since You Went Away: Letters to a Soldier from
            His Wife&quot;  -
            a collection of letters from  homefront wife Wilder to her overseas
            husband while he was away at war. The touching
            and often gripping film epitomized Hollywood's effort to boost morale
            during the war, with a series of vignettes showing the effects of
            rationing, personal sacrifices, and the many reunions and departures.
            The family's individual romances, jobs, triumphs, tragedies and problems
            were presented in this classic melodramatic weeper, with a great
            Oscar-winning score from Max Steiner. In the all-star cast were matriarchal
            wife and mother Anne Hilton (Claudette Colbert) who held her family
            of two daughters together - the eldest Jane (Jennifer Jones), a high
            school senior, and youngest Bridget (or Brig) (teenaged Shirley Temple
            in her first major post-childhood role) - when their beloved businessman
            father Tim Hilton (Neil Hamilton) (completely off-screen, although
            pictured in a photograph) who had volunteered to serve, was later
            reported lost and missing in action. The family's black maid Fidelia
            (Hattie McDaniel) worked  to pay her rent due to stretched
            finances and increasing economic hardships. The Hiltons also took
            on a boarder - a crusty, outspoken, retired and elderly lodger Col.
            William G. &quot;Bill&quot; Smollett
            (Monty Woolley), and  entertained
          a frequent visitor and detached observer - family friend and bachelor
          Navy Lieutenant Commander Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Willett
          (Joseph Cotten), who had always been in love with Anne. As a temporary
          guest in the household, he became the focus of the anxious emotional
          feelings and tribulations of the family during war-time. While
            on leave, shy sailor  Cpl. William G. 'Bill' Smollett II
            (Robert Walker), the estranged grandson of Col. Smollett,  entered
          into a short but intense romance with Jane. [Note: Walker was Jennifer
            Jones' estranged, real-life husband at the time, although she would
            soon divorce and marry producer Selznick.] The
            sweethearts' railroad station parting scene was one of the most
            unforgettable, tear-jerking sequences of all-time.  All of the
            family members sacrificed their future plans during the war effort:
            Anne took a job as a factory welder, Jane postponed college to
            become a nurse's aid, and everyone pitched in to raise money at
            an airplane hangar dance. Harsh
            war-time realities came into focus when a telegram arrived announcing
          the death of Jane's boyfriend during combat at Salerno. In the film's
          surprise ending after tremendous heartbreak following news of the loss
          of Anne's husband, she then received a cablegram by
          telephone on Christmas Eve 
          informing her that he was actually safe and returning home, and she
          and her daughters joyfully embraced. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Howard Hawks<br />
            Loosely based on Hemingway's 1937 novel, director Howard Hawks' romantic
            drama featured  a screenplay co-written by William Faulkner.
            The film's story was overshadowed by the on-screen and off-screen
            romance of stars Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, the first of
            four films they made together. Their most famous scene was their
            conversation that included the question: &quot;You
            know how to whistle, don't you Steve?&quot;  Bogart's role
            as fishing boat captain Harry Morgan also closely resembled his role
            as disaffected Rick Blaine in <i><a href="casa.html">Casablanca
            (1942)</a>.</i> During
            World War II in 1940 on the French island of Martinique in Fort-de-France,
            governed by the Vichy government, ex-patriate Harry Morgan (Humphrey
            Bogart), charter boat owner of the <i>Queen Conch</i>, preferred
             to remain uncommitted and refused to take sides in the war, accompanied
            by his alcoholic sidekick Eddie (Walter Brennan) (known for saying: &quot;Was
            you ever bit by a dead bee?&quot;)  The most remembered feature of
            the film was the sultry, electrically-sizzling romance that was generated
            between Harry and stranded American Marie &quot;Slim&quot; Browning
            (19 year old Lauren Bacall in her film debut and first film with
            Bogart), a sexy lounge singer who often was accompanied by piano
            player Cricket (Hoagey Carmichael). Against his own better judgment,
            Harry was convinced to change his mind and fight the Nazis, and in
            the process secured enough money to pay for Marie's ticket back to
            the US. He helped transport Free French Resistance leader Paul De
            Bursac (Walter Szurovy) and his beautiful wife Mme. Hellene de Bursac
            (Dolores Moran) to Martinique. The transport wasn't entirely successful
            - De Bursac was wounded, and Harry's boat was identified by Vichy
            authorities. Harry, Marie, and Eddie were forced to leave Martinique,
            and take the De Bursacs to Devil's Island, to help rescue another
            freedom fighter. </font></p>        </td>

              Allen<br />
            This was a spooky, eerie, unusual, and suspenseful ghost story from
            Paramount Studios, advertised with the tagline: &quot;From the Most
            Popular Mystery Romance since &quot;Rebecca&quot;! - and it even
            had a lesbian subtext. The tale was based on Irish writer Dorothy
            Macardle's 1941 novel <i>The Easy Freehold (aka Uneasy Freehold)</i>.
            This film was followed by the murder mystery sequel, <i>The
            Unseen (1945)</i>. In
            1937, music critic/composer Roderick (&quot;Rick&quot;) (Ray Milland)
            and his sister Pamela Fitzgerald (Ruth Hussey) purchased an empty
            Gothic house on the English Cornish coast in Devonshire for an unusually
            low price from Cmdr. Beech (Donald Crisp). Soon after moving in,
            they experienced strange phenomena and disturbances in the haunted
            house, dubbed the Windward House: unexplainable cold spots, the smell
            of mimosas, flickering candles, the sound of a woman crying, pages
            turning by themselves, wilting flowers, and creaking doors which
            closed by themselves. They met a local young woman, 20 year-old
            Stella Meredith (Gail Russell) with long deceased parents who was
            impulsively drawn to the house. She was the grand-daughter of Cmdr.
            Beech, but he had forbidden her to visit due to unpleasant past memories.
            The house was supposedly haunted by Stella's dead mother Mary Meredith
            (Lynda Grey as ghost),
            Cmdr. Beech's daughter. Mary was mysteriously killed many years earlier
            in a fall from the cliffs. The couple tried to help Stella discover
            the answer to the mystery of the house's uninvited haunting, while
            Rick fell in love with her. [Note: In the twisting plot, it
            was learned that Stella's artistic father Llewellyn, although married
            to Mary, was in a loveless relationship. He was having an extra-marital
            affair with his gypsy Spanish girl model Carmel. The secret to the
            mystery was that  Carmel was actually Stella's
            birth mother. A pregnant Carmel was sent to Paris while the pregnancy
            was kept quiet, and she was to remain there permanently, while the
            Merediths presumably planned to adopt the child back in England,
            because the saintly Mary objected to motherhood. However, Carmel
            couldn't stay away from her child. When Stella was a 3 year-old toddler,
            Mary and Carmel fought together at the side of the cliff when Mary
            attempted to murder Carmel's
            child, and Mary fell to her death. Carmel died shortly later of
            pneumonia. Stella's father Llewellyn died when Stella was 17.] In
            the film's conclusion, Cmdr. Beech was shocked to see the ghost of
            Mary and suffered a fatal heart attack. The mystery was solved when
            it was found that there were two ghosts that had reappeared, mimosa-scented
            Carmel's  
            ghost  (Betty Farrington as
            ghost voice) and Mary's angry and malevolent ghost. The ghost of
             Carmel  was there to warn Stella
            and shield her from harm,
        and the other one of Mary was there to seek vengeance. The power of
            the ghost of Mary was neutralized when Rick confronted her: &quot;We're
            not frightened of you anymore,&quot; and the haunting ghost disappeared
            (and with the threat gone, Carmel also vanished). A shaken but relieved
            Rick gave Stella the humorous closing line regarding Mary: &quot;Well,
            I've had a narrow escape. She might have been my mother-in-law.&quot; </font></p>        </td>
