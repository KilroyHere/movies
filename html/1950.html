              minutes, D: Joseph L. Mankiewicz<br />
            Best Director-winning  Joseph L. Mankiewicz's much-loved,
            lengthy, acerbic drama of backstage New York theatre life was a very
            literate Best Picture-winning film, and also an Oscar-winner for
            Mankiewicz's own Best Screenplay. Wit
            and sarcasm reigned supreme (e.g., &quot;Fasten your seat belts.
            It's going to be a bumpy night&quot;), and Marilyn Monroe also appeared
            in a bit cameo role as aspiring actress Miss Caswell. As
            the film opened during an awards ceremony, a rising, unscrupulous
            star known as Eve Harrington (Oscar-nominated Anne Baxter) accepted
            the Sarah Siddons award for Best Actress of the year on the Broadway
            scene. In flashback, it was then revealed how the shameless young
            starlet had insinuated herself into the life of her idol, Margo Channing
            (Oscar-nominated Bette Davis) - an aging, bitchy accomplished
            Broadway stage star. Margo befriended and  took the seemingly-naive,
            shy, helpless and innocent fan Eve under her wing as her confidential
            assistant/secretary, but soon
            after, the duplicitous Eve schemed to steal her theatrical
            roles and her fiancee-lover Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill). By
            ruthlessly exploiting the older woman's kindness and hospitality,
            Eve managed to achieve her present success while almost destroying
            the veteran star in the process. On the sidelines but also in the
            same company as Eve was the film's acid-tongued narrator Addison
            De Witt (Oscar-winning George Sanders) - a
            cynical, egotistical columnist/critic. As Eve's conniving ways were
            revealed, she became Margo's understudy, and then orchestrated Margo's
            absence by stranding her out of town, so that she could take her
            place and receive accolades from NY theatre critics. She even enlisted
            the aid of Karen Richards (Oscar-nominated Celeste Holm), the wife
            of the playwright Lloyd Richards (Hugh Marlowe), and was able to
            aggressively manipulate him away from Karen to provide her with a
            new play. Meanwhile, Addison De Witt saw through Eve's calculating
            nature and ultimately called her out on the day of her debut performance
            for her manufactured past, and her opportunistic ambitions. The ending
            of the film returned to the awards banquet to find the starlet
            clinging to her trophy. Ironically, she would soon be replaced by
             another younger fan in the wings - an aspiring protege named Phoebe
            (Barbara Bates) that resembled Eve who would undoubtedly take her
            place in the near future.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: John Huston<br />
            Director John Huston's  classic noirish thriller was an adaptation
            based on a novel by W. R. Burnett. It told about  legendary mastermind,
            aging, ex-convict criminal Erwin &quot;Doc&quot; Riedenschneider
            (Sam Jaffe), who came out of retirement
            (prison after a seven-year stint) for one last jewel robbery with
            an assemblage of underworld characters - he meticulously explained
            his proposed heist to steal jewels worth more than $500,000. The
            film realistically depicted all the semi-professional criminals and
            their motivations in the crime - the three, two-bit hired crooks:  &quot;box
            man&quot; (safecracker) Louie Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso), a getaway driver - hunchbacked diner
            owner Gus Minissi (James Whitmore), and a tough, strong-armed &quot;hooligan&quot; drifter
            named Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden) from a Kentucky horse-farm, with
            his sympathetic girlfriend Doll Conovan (Jean Hagen). Corrupt
              and sleazy lawyer and financier Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern)
               would fence the stolen goods to support his expensive habits (e.g.,
              an affair with seductive mistress). He
              maintained a blonde, voluptuous mistress Angela Phinlay (Marilyn
              Monroe in a minor but memorable cameo role) - to his distaste,
              she called him &quot;Uncle Lon&quot; and he called her &quot;some
            sweet kid.&quot; The actual jewel robbery was clinically-delineated
            with details of the tense heist (the hammering through a brick wall,
              the nitro bottle with home-made &quot;soup&quot;, the alarm system,
            etc.). The successful heist unraveled quickly and everything
              fell apart when an alarm accidentally sounded and the safecracker
            was mortally wounded by an armed guard's stray bullet. A
            double-cross was also planned by &quot;the big fixer&quot; Emmerich
            who planned to steal the jewels and escape to Europe. He had hired
            his own armed shady private detective Bob Brannom (Brad Dexter).
            Emmerich double-crossed both Dix and &quot;Doc&quot; when
            he delayed payment for the jewels and suggested taking possession
            of the jewels from &quot;Doc&quot; - at gunpoint. Dix saw the proposed
            sabotage of the fencing operation and shot Brannom, but was also
            mortally wounded. Afterwards, Emmerich revealed
              his corruption to his wife May (Dorothy Tree), who feared his many
              associations with &quot;awful people...downright criminals&quot; -
              he replied to her: &quot;Oh, there's nothing's so different about
            them. After all, crime is only a left-handed form of human endeavor.&quot; Emmerich's
            alibi (through Angela) was revealed to be a lie. When threatened
            with arrest by the police, Emmerich retreated to a side room to write
            an apology-suicide note to his wife May, but then he tore up the
            note into pieces, reached for a gun in the desk drawer, and committed
            suicide (the gun-shot was heard off-screen). During his escape Doc
            was apprehended by police after he stopped at a roadside diner during
            his getaway. He was doomed when he obsessively (and voyeuristically)
            leered at a young girl named Jeannie (Helene Stanley), then gave
            her a bunch of coins to put in the jukebox (&quot;Play me a tune&quot;)
            and watched her dance to the music - his delayed departure (he believed
            he had &quot;plenty of time&quot;) led to his arrest - two policemen
            watched him from outside through venetian blinds. In the film's final
            press conference, Police Commissioner Hardy (John McIntire) delivered
            a moralizing speech to reporters about rampant crime. In the final
            scene, a bleeding and dying Dix Handley (who had fled) stumbled from
            his car into Hickory Wood Farm (his father's Kentucky horse farm
            lost during the Depression, and his own childhood home) - he staggered,
            collapsed and expired in a sunny horse pasture amidst four grazing
            and nuzzling colts he had dreamed of owning.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Born Yesterday (1950), </b>103 minutes, D: George
        Cukor<br />
        Director George Cukor's comedy was one of the greatest of all-time, based
        upon Garson Kanin's 1946 play, and remade as <i>Born Yesterday (1993)</i> with
        Melanie Griffith, John Goodman, and Don Johnson. In  the opening sequence,
         all three of the major characters were introduced during an
        elaborate arrival scene at Washington DC's Hotel Statler: corrupt, disreputable
        and uncouth, ignorant, and crooked millionaire junkyard (scrap-iron)
        tycoon Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford), his unrefined, expensively-dressed
        (with multiple fur coats) &quot;dumb blonde&quot; ex-chorus girl mistress/fiancee
         (a 'kept woman' for seven years) from Brooklyn named Emma &quot;Billie&quot; Dawn
        (Judy Holliday, a Best Actress Oscar winner in a major upset), and influential,
        DC political journalist Paul Verrall (William Holden). Brock and his
         mistress were escorted to an upper-floor, reserved &quot;entire wing&quot; of
        three expensive suites of rooms. In consultation with his Washington
         lawyer Jim Devery (Howard St. John), Brock was seriously contemplating
         setting up an educational tutor to refine Billie's harsh social graces,
        so that he wouldn't be embarrassed by her behavior in front of  congressmen
            and other influential people. Brock hired Paul
         Verrall as Billie's tutor for $200/week - to refine Billie and make
         her more socially respectable and happy: (&quot;Show her the ropes,
         sorta, and kinda explain things to her&quot;), while he was working
         bribes and trying to influence politicians. Paul 
            was particularly interested in trying to expose Brock's nefarious
            business dealings while working with Billie. As part of her tutoring
         sessions, Paul gave Billie civic-lessons field trip/tours around Washington
         DC's monuments and public buildings. (It was revealed during the story
         that Brock had unethically been using the unwitting Billie as an accomplice
         for his many business maneuverings and illegalities by having his empire
         of junkyards registered in her name - so he wouldn't be held responsible
         if prosecuted.) A burgeoning romance developed between Billie and bachelor
         Paul, after he kissed her in an elevator. Over time, Billie began
        to develop social consciousness and a true understanding of democracy,
         as well as an understanding of Brock's corruption, greed, power and
         personal arrogance. In the climactic scene, the newly-independent, free-thinking
         Billie realized that she needed to escape from Brock forever, when he
         was becoming more aggressively abusive, and still calling her 'dumb.'
         She called him a &quot;Big Fascist!&quot;, and retorted: &quot;Would
         you do me a favor, Harry?...Drop dead!&quot; Finally,  she
         stood up to Brock, and laid down an ultimatum: (&quot;When you steal
         from the government, you steal from yourself, ya dumb ox!&quot;). She
         affirmed that she would  no longer sign any of his business papers
            in his scheme to form a scrap-iron cartel, and threatened to leave
            him. She would slowly relinquish his 126 different properties back to him that she
         legally owned (he had signed them over to her to hide them from the
         government), but only one by one: &quot;In
         this whole thing, I guess you forgot about me - about how I'm a partner....So
         here's how it's gonna be. I don't want 'em. I don't want anything of
         yours or to do with you, so I'm gonna sign 'em over ...only not all
         at once. Just one at a time. One a year. <i>Only you gotta behave</i>!
         'Cause if you don't, I could let go on everything! For what you've done,
         even since I've known you, I bet you could be put in jail for about
         900 years. You'd be a pretty old man when you got out.&quot; Meanwhile, 
          the two lovers Paul and Billie were married. The film's final lines
         were spoken to a motorcycle cop who asked for their license, but he
         was given their recent marriage license. He chuckled: &quot;License
         please. No, not this license&quot; - but then quickly forgave their
         crime: &quot;Okay, forget it. My wedding present. But take it easy,
         or you'll never make it.&quot; Billie spoke about her recent marriage
         to Paul: &quot;Oh, don't worry, we'll make it. It's a clear case of
         predestination.&quot; Officer: &quot;Pre--- what?&quot; Billie: &quot;Look it up!&quot;</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Cinderella (1950), </b>76 minutes, D: Disney Studio
            (Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske) <br />
          Disney's superbly-animated, mid-century, musical fantasy masterpiece
          (based on the 1697 fairy tale classic by Charles Perrault) was the
          first of Disney's feature animations to be turned into a live-action
          cinematic effort (in 2015). It began with a hard-bound storybook phrase: &quot;Once
          upon a time, in a far-away land,&quot; 
          brought to life by the Narrator (Betty Lou Gerson). The kind-hearted,
          hard-working Cinderella (voice of Ilene Woods) was introduced with
          her cruel, widowed stepmother Lady Tremaine (voice of Eleanor Audley)
          and two nasty, selfish, vain and ugly step-sisters, the older Drizella
          (voice of Rhoda Williams) and younger Anastasia (voice of Lucille Bliss),
          who treated her like a scullery maid and ordered her to do laundry
          and clean the house. Her only friends were farm animals (benevolent
          mice and chirping birds). In his castle, the King (voice of Luis Van
          Rooten), interested in grandchildren via the marriage of his son The
          Prince (voice of William Phipps), ordered the Grand Duke (voice of
          Luis Van Rooten) to invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom to
          a Royal Ball. After the Royal Ball was announced, Cinderella - with
            the help of her animal friends, 
            including Jaq and mouse Gus (voice of James MacDonald) (who were
            often chased by Lucifer, Lady Tremaine's cat) and
            flying bluebirds, created a pink ball gown from scraps of discarded
            fabric - but then after it was destroyed by her stepsisters and was
            left in tattered rags, the Fairy Godmother (voice of Verna Felton)
            appeared and magically transformed the dress into a beautiful, sparkling
            white ball gown (&quot;Why, it's like a dream!&quot;), accompanied
            by two glass slippers. The Fairy Godmother also cautioned Cinderella
          to return by midnight before the spell would end.   The magical wand
            of the fairy Godmother also performed other transformations: a pumpkin
              into a carriage, four mice into horses, the bloodhound dog Bruno
              into a footman and old horse Major into a coach-man driver, accompanied
              by the  Fairy Godmother's singing of the 
			  Oscar-nominated song, &quot;Bibbidy-Bobbidi-Boo&quot;
          (aka The Magic Song) with nonsensical lyrics. During the Royal Ball,
          Cinderella waltz-danced with the smitten Prince Charming (singing voice
          of Mike Douglas) and they sang: &quot;So This Is Love&quot;; as midnight
          approached, Cinderella ran off, leaving one of her slippers behind
          on the staircase. She barely escaped before the coach turned back into
          a pumpkin. The Prince was determined
              to find the rightful owner of the slipper, and visited each home
              to try on the slipper. Cinderella's
              chances of trying it on were sabotaged when her stepmother locked
          her in the attic of the stone tower. In 
            a comical scene when the Grand Duke visited Cinderella's chateau,
              the obnoxious step-sisters vainly attempted to squeeze their oversized
              feet into the glass slipper; once Cinderella had been freed
               by her animal friends who cleverly stole the key
              and transported it upstairs to unlock the attic door, Lady Tremaine
              tripped  the
            page to deliberately  smash the slipper. However,   Cinderella
            outwitted them when she produced the second slipper (that she had
          worn to the ball) that fit perfectly on her foot. In the &quot;they
          lived happily ever after&quot; ending after wedding the Prince - Cinderella
          rode off in a gold carriage with her new husband. </font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>D. O. A. (1950), </b>83 minutes, D: Rudolph Mate<br />
          Rudolph Mat&eacute;'s nihilistic, classic film noir detective story
          (also noted as 1949) was remade as <i>Color Me Dead (1969, Australia)</i> and
          as <i>D.O.A. (1988)</i>, starring Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan in a completely-revised
          story). In  the famous unexpected opening, 33
          year-old income tax accountant/notary public Frank Bigelow (Edmond
          O'Brien) from Banning, CA, filmed from behind, entered the Homicide
          Division of a Los Angeles police station to report a murder: (&quot;I
          want to report a murder&quot;) - he was speaking <i>almost</i> from
          beyond the grave; the doomed Bigelow gave a classic reply when asked
          who was murdered by the Police Captain (Roy Engel) - he said: 
          &quot;I was&quot;; to Frank's surprise, the Captain had already been
          alerted about Bigelow with an APB (All-Points Bulletin Missing Persons
          Report) from Inspector Bannet in the Homicide Division in San Francisco.
          The film reverted to a lengthy flashback beginning two days earlier
          - Bigelow was working as an accountant and notary public in his hometown
          office of Banning, CA, with his blonde secretary-girlfriend Paula
          Gibson (Pamela Britton) - she was interested in a serious relationship
          with him,  although he kept putting her off. Bigelow arrived for a
          one-week vacation at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, where
          after a night of carousing in a jazz or &quot;jive&quot; night-club
          (&quot;The Fisherman&quot;) on the Embarcadero, he  
          complained of a &quot;bellyache.&quot; The diagnosis was  
          that he had been fatally poisoned via radiation by iridium (with a
          lethal dose of a glow-in-the-dark &quot;luminous toxin&quot;), when
          he didn't notice that his drink in The Fisherman had been swapped and
          doctored. Bigelow was told that he was already &quot;dead&quot; 
		  and that he had maybe a day or a week or two to live. Bigelow was notified
             about an urgent phone call that  had been received (during his first
            two days' absence) from owner Eugene Phillips of the Los Angeles-based
            Phillips Importing and Exporting Company. Soon after the attempted
            contact with Bigelow,  Phillips had suspiciously committed
            suicide - apparently by leaping off the balcony of his high-rise,
          six-story apartment.  Two days earlier, Phillips seemed to have been
		  in &quot;a pretty bad jam&quot; and faced prison - he had been arrested (but
		  then released on bail) for selling a shipment of stolen iridium (a
		  costly rare metal), even though the very-innocent Phillips claimed
		  it was a false allegation. He didn't know that he had been framed and
		  the deal was actually made six months earlier in Palm Springs, CA by
		  company associate George Reynolds (an alias for Raymond Rakubian) to
		  his uncle-dealer - a gangster named Majak (Luther Adler). Reynolds
		  had since disappeared. If the original bill of sale surfaced, it would
		  show that Reynolds was the dealer-seller and would face a long and
		  stiff prison term, not Phillips. The critical bill of sale could prove
            that the authorized transaction (with a bill of sale) was not made
            by Phillips at all - and was not the motive for his 'suicide.'
          However, it appeared that Reynolds (or someone
          else, revealed later!) had stolen or destroyed the bill of sale, and
          people involved were being eliminated, to erase all evidence of the
          sale. Bigelow was involved in the case - because 6 months
            earlier, he had notarized the bill of sale of iridium from company
		  associate Reynolds to Phillips. Thus, he was poisoned as part of a
		  cover-up conspiracy. Bigelow learned that George Reynolds had been
		  dead for the past five months, and now that Bigelow was tangentially
		  connected with Majak's nefarious dealings, he had to be eliminated
		  (via poison). The film's bombshell revelation was that Mr. Halliday
		  (William Ching), the main financial officer/comptroller of the Import/Export
		  company owned by Phillips, and Eugene's wife Mrs. Phillips (Lynn Baggett)
		  had been involved in a two year affair. During dinner with Halliday,
		  Mrs. Phillips and her brother-in-law Stanley (Henry Hart), Eugene's
		  younger brother, the latter confronted them with an incriminating letter
		  about Halliday's affair with Mrs. Phillips, but then turned up poisoned
		  (with only a few days to live). Soon after Eugene had found out about his
		  wife's illicit affair, he had been pushed off the balcony to his death
		  by Halliday. The theft of the iridium by Majak was created as a diversion
		  to cover up their act of murder by Halliday. Widowed Mrs. Phillips
		  and her conspiratorial secret lover Halliday faced a possible murder
		  conviction of plotting to kill Eugene. In order to cover-up the murder
		  and divert attention, all evidence of the sale of iridium six months
		  earlier for Phillips' business was being systematically eliminated
		  by the two of them, to draw attention there. Mrs. Phillips admitted
		  to stealing the bill of sale herself, and claimed that anyone else
		  who was involved with or could prove that there was a bill of sale
		  for the illegal substance was to be eliminated. Mrs. Phillips confessed
		  everything to Bigelow about why he had been targeted with the poison
		  (administered by Halliday in SF) - because he had inadvertently become
		  involved. As he left his downtown LA office, Bigelow was shot at multiple
		  times on the stairway but unharmed - during a crazed, gun-blasting
		  face-off with slick but ruthless murderer Mr. Halliday. Bigelow shot
		  him dead. Bigelow returned to the police station, and the film's lengthy
		  flashback ended, where he finished describing how he had just solved
		  his own murder case: (&quot;All
            I did was notarize a bill of sale. But that piece of paper could
            have proven that Phillips didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.
            And that's why Halliday poisoned me&quot;) - Bigelow summarized that
            he was killed because he  innocently notarized a
          bill of sale for the stolen iridium.  After Bigelow
          fell dead to the floor and the Deputy asked, in an equally famous closing
          exchange: &quot;How shall I make out the report on him, Captain?&quot;;
           the Captain responded: &quot;Better make it 'Dead on Arrival'.&quot; In
            a close-up, Bigelow's Missing Persons report from San Francisco was
            stamped: D.O.A., before the end credits. </font></p>        </td>

        minutes, D: Vincente Minnelli<br />
        Director Vincente Minnelli's and MGM's satirical domestic comedy told
        about a wedding ceremony, and all the travails and joys of a harrassed
        father experiencing his only daughter's expensive wedding. In the opening
        voice-over narration of harrassed and exhausted father, Stanley T. Banks
        or &quot;Pops&quot; (Oscar-nominated Spencer Tracy), talked directly
        to the camera about the stresses before (and after) a lavish June wedding
        for his 20 year-old daughter Kay (Elizabeth Taylor), and his recollections
        of how she had grown up so fast to become engaged - with an extravagant
        marriage ceremony that had just occurred. During the film's lengthy flashback
        that told the witty and contrived story of the previous three months
            leading up to the wedding, Stanley realized that
              his 'little girl' Kay was soon to be leaving in anticipation of
            her marriage. Stanley desired to &quot;get a peek at this Superman,&quot; his
            daughter's fiancee, Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor) from the front window,
            and had a pained reaction. In the middle of the night, Stanley frantically
              worried to his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett) about Kay's choice of
          a fiancee: &quot;We don't know a thing about him. Not a darn
          thing. Not where he comes from, what he makes, or what he makes making
          it.&quot; They had a lengthy, one-sided &quot;man-to-man&quot; financial
          talk (three months before the nuptials) to determine if Buckley could
          suitably support Kay. During the required meeting of the Banks to get
          to know the wealthy in-laws the Dunstans, Herbert
          or &quot;Herbie&quot; (Moroni Olsen) and Doris  (Billie Burke),
          Stanley admitted: &quot;We did more bare-faced lying in those few minutes
          than we had done in our entire lives.&quot; In  the scene of the Banks'
          party to announce the engagement, Stanley found himself confined to
          the kitchen and was unable to deliver his prepared speech. Stanley
          became exasperated about how everyone else was spending his money,
          but soon realized he would lose the battle for a small wedding: &quot;From
          then on, I was a dead duck.&quot; Stanley was completely flabbergasted
          by the amount of clothing being purchased for the event, and all of
          the other included expenses: (&quot;It's only two syllables from Banks
          to bankruptcy...What are people gonna say when I'm in the gutter because
          I tried to put on a wedding like a Roman emperor?&quot;); eventually,
          Stanley gave in to the entire guest list. Stanley faced his daughter's
          overbearing caterers, led by fussy caterer Mr. Massoula (Leo G. Carroll):
          (&quot;An experienced caterer can make you ashamed of your house in
          15 minutes&quot;). Once  the RSVPs for the invitations began to arrive,
          Stanley was dismayed by the many positive responses. Then, Kay  abruptly
          announced that &quot;the wedding's off&quot; during a sudden explosion
          of emotion, after Buckley impulsively proposed that the couple go on
          a fishing trip in Nova Scotia for their honeymoon; Buckley arrived
          to sincerely apologize for his awful and selfish lack of judgment with
          Kay. Stanley was forced to intercede after the couple's fight and make
          things right between the feuding couple, and the two quickly reconciled
          their differences. During the botched church rehearsal for the wedding
              arrived, the groom Buckley and the minister Rev. Galsworthy (Paul
              Harvey) were absent from the proceedings, and the rehearsal run
              by the minister's assistant Mr. Tringle (Melville Cooper) was totally
          disorganized and chaotic. The night before the wedding, Stanley  also
          experienced a nightmarish vision of what might happen at a disastrous
          wedding (he imagined himself appearing late, in tatters, and not able
          to walk down the springy and rubbery aisle, as his daughter screamed
          at him from the altar). Once he awoke from the nightmare during a  midnight
          snack kitchen scene, he visited with his daughter as they shared a
          bottle of milk and sandwiches. She confessed her fears about the monumental
          wedding about to occur, and then complimented her father: &quot;Nothing
          ever fazes you, does it?&quot; The
          day of the wedding dawned with massive distractions and confusion over
          preparations in the house for the reception, including collisions between
          caterers setting up and movers taking out the furniture; however, Stanley
          then saw his daughter in her wedding gown, reflected in a triple-paned
          full-length mirror (&quot;She looked like the princess in a fairy tale&quot;)
          - it was a wonderfully visualized moment. As Stanley played his part
          to give Kay away during the ceremony, he felt ambiguity and confusion
          about losing his only daughter: (&quot;What's it going to be like to
          come home and not find her. Not to hear her voice calling 'Hi Pops'
          as I come in. I suddenly realized what I was doing. I was giving up
          Kay. Something inside me was beginning to hurt&quot;). The film concluded
          with the chaotic reception back at the Banks home; Stanley missed her
          throughout the entire reception in the crowded house, in the midst
          of the hubbub and catering staff and the crush of the hordes of guests,
          he failed to see the throwing of Kay's bouquet from the front
          indoor staircase, and only caught a glimpse of her departing in the
          newlyweds' car. Later after the last guests departed,
          Stanley surveyed the &quot;wreckage&quot; in the house with Ellie,
          and suddenly felt how empty the house had become. In a concluding 
          tearjerking scene, Kay made a post-wedding phone call (from the NY
          train station on her way to her Nova Scotia honeymoon) to lovingly
          say 'thank you' to her father: (&quot;And Pops, you've been just wonderful.
          I love you. I love you very much. Bye bye&quot;). Stanley delivered
          a memorable last line: (&quot;Nothing's really changed, has it? You
          know what they say: 'My son's my son until he gets him a wife, but
          my daughter's my daughter all of her life.' All of our life&quot;). </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The File on Thelma Jordon (1950)</b>,
            100 minutes, D: Robert Siodmak </font><br />
            <font size="2">The film noirish story centered around mysterious,
              duplicitous and treacherous <i>femme fatale</i> Thelma Jordon (Barbara
              Stanwyck) - as evidenced by the film's tagline: &quot;...SHE'LL
              LIE...KILL OR KISS HER WAY OUT OF ANYTHING!&quot; Thelma captured
              the emotionally-dependent heart of unhappily-married assistant
              District Attorney Cleve Marshall (Wendell Cory). Cleve's wife Pamela
              (Joan Tetzel) was more loyal to her wealthy father, and she constantly
              criticized him, pushing him to heavy drinking. Thelma chose Cleve
              as the duped fall-guy when she came to the office of chief investigator
              Miles Scott (Paul Kelly) to report threates of robberies at her
              home. She engaged in an adulterous and illicit (but genuine) love
              affair with Cleve, telling him: &quot;Maybe I'm just a dame and
              didn't know it.&quot; She had even confessed to him, falsely, that she was lovelessly married
              and recently separated from shady jewel thief Tony Laredo (Richard
              Rober) - when in fact they had planned the crimes together. The
              misguided and self-deluding &quot;fall guy&quot; DA threw aside
              his family, future, and honor and helped to defend Thelma after
              her wealthy Aunt Vera Edwards (Gertrude Hoffman) was murdered.
              DA Cleve helped Thelma to reconstruct an 'untouched' version of
              the crime scene, so that neither of them would be suspected of
              foul play for tampering with evidence. Thelma seemed to imply  
              to Cleve that Tony committed the murder during the robbery of her
              aunt's valuable emerald necklace, and made it look like an outside
              job. In reality, Thelma was the cold-blooded, calculating murderess.
              There was also suspicion about an unseen accomplice dubbed &quot;Mr.
              X&quot; (Cleve himself), who had assisted Thelma. Thelma
              became a prime suspect - she was charged for the murder (her
              Aunt's recently-rewritten will in her favor was a major factor).
              Love-struck DA Cleve took up the prosecution on her behalf, quietly
              hired defense attorney Kingsley Willis (Stanley Ridges) for Thelma,
              and manipulated the case to her favor. He circumvented revealed
              evidence of a dark life of blackmail, gambling, and relationship
              with her husband-partner-in-crime Tony, and she was found not guilty.
              After a post-trial rendezvous of Thelma with Tony, the couple planned
              to flee and live off her Aunt's inheritance. When Cleve arrived
              to be with Thelma, she told him that Tony had reappeared from Chicago
              for her (&quot;I've always loved him...You must have known it, except you didn't want to
              know&quot;). She admitted that Cleve had been set up to help defend her (&quot;You
                were the fall guy, Cleve, right from the beginning&quot;), and
                that she had killed Vera (&quot;I'd like to say I didn't intend
                to kill her, but when you have a gun, you always intend if you
                have to&quot;). After Tony knocked out Cleve from behind, Tony
                and Thelma fled together to go &quot;as far away as possible.&quot; She
                struggled with accomplice Tony as he drove, trying to injure
                him with a burning-hot dashboard cigarette lighter. He died when
                their car crashed over a cliff and caught fire, while Thelma
                was hospitalized. During her deathbed scene, she made a full
                confession to Miles, but refused to identify &quot;Mr. X.&quot; As
                she expired, she told Cleve: &quot;You don't suppose they could
                just let half of me die?&quot; Miles realized that Cleve was
                the mysterious &quot;Mr. X.&quot; </font></p></td>

                Deadly is the Female),</b> 87 minutes, D: Joseph H. Lewis<br />
            Director Joseph H. Lewis' supercharged, low-budget cult
            favorite - a noirish, <a href="bonn.html"><i>Bonnie-and-Clyde</i></a>  love-on-the-run
            tale, was based on MacKinlay Kantor's story. It was a story about
            two sharpshooters who turned to a life of crime - a reckless couple
            fatally attracted to their firearms - and each other. It was one
            of the best B films ever made. In the opening scene (in the pouring
            rain), 14 year-old Bart Tare (Rusty Tamblyn) broke a hardware
            store display window to steal  a pearl-handled gun
              and ammunition from inside, and then fell
               down in a mud puddle at the feet of the local Sheriff Boston (Trevor
              Bardette). In his troubled life, Bart was being raised by his older
              sister Ruby (Anabel Shaw). She claimed that although Bart was &quot;gun-crazy,&quot; he
              had a strong aversion to killing things (&quot;He wouldn't kill
              anything&quot;). Bart was sent to reform school for four years
              because of his &quot;dangerous mania&quot; and then served in the
            Army. After serving in the military,
              gun-loving Bert Tare (John Dall) met blonde, trick sharp-shooter
              <i>femme fatale</i> Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins), portraying Annie
              Oakley in Packett's Wild West Carnival side-show - they were perfect
            companions. Bart was immediately hired by the overly-possessive
            Packett to work in the show, although it didn't last long after
            Bart moved in on Packett's girl, and Bart discovered that Packett
            was blackmailing her about a murder in the past that she had
            committed during a robbery in St. Louis with him. After being fired,
            the two wild, amoral lovers sought out a justice of the peace to
            get married, as Annie Laurie thought about how it might improve her
            life. They experienced an idyllic honeymoon, but then following
            a sudden downturn after a visit to Las Vegas, they found themselves
            in an impoverished and financially-strapped state. In their drab,
            cheap hotel room, during a domestic squabble brewing between the
            couple, Annie Laurie (naked
            under her terry-cloth bathrobe) seductively tempted Bart to pursue
            more crime with her - and commit armed robbery. She threatened
            to walk out on Bart unless they both engaged in a life of crime.
             The blackmail scene ended with his sexual acquiescence and gratification,
            his decision to remain, and a close-up of his mouth inching towards
            hers for a passionate kiss. The kiss dissolved
            into the gunshot blast of a gumball bowl during a holdup at a Travelers
            Aid hotel desk - an orgasmic, erotic/violent beginning of their crime
            rampage as gun-toting 'wild animals.' She was able to get him to
            agree to more holdups - portrayed as a series of small stick-ups
            and robberies - a liquor store, another store clerk, and a gas station.
             Annie Laurie pretended to be a hitchhiker to hold up a kindly
                driver who picked her up - they then stole his car for their
            next major heist. The next sequence was an  unedited, virtuoso, single-shot
              uninterrupted (long take) robbery that occurred at a Hampton Bank
              (Illinois) - the two bank robbers were dressed in their Western
              showbiz cowboy-cowgirl outfits with guns. It was cleverly filmed
              from the back-seat of their robbery car (a stolen Cadillac). The
              scene extended from the time of their drive into town and up to
              the bank, including getaway driver Laurie's distraction of a cop
              (Robert Osterloh) on the sidewalk during the robbery; when Bart
              emerged with an alarm bell ringing, Laurie karate-chopped the policeman
              in the neck to knock him down and render him unconscious, and the
              two escaped with Bart driving - while the camera was still filming
            the long-take from behind their shoulders inside the car! Their
            next robbery's getaway was at the Rangers and Growers Exchange. The
            two killers were identified by vengeful carnival owner Packett who
            reported that Annie Laurie and Bart were his former employees. A
            full-scale manhunt across state lines was undertaken by the authorities.
             Bart was beginning to feel regret for his criminal lifestyle with
            the cold-hearted killer Annie Laurie. He was compelled to agree with
            her request for &quot;one more job.&quot; According to her calculated
            plan, they could be rich for life and leave the country, but would
            first have to split for awhile so they wouldn't be recognized and
            caught. For one last carefully-planned payroll office heist
            at the Armour Meat Company Plant in Albuquerque, NM where they both
            had taken jobs (with fake names), the robbery turned deadly when
            Annie Laurie was forced to shoot and kill her supervisor, office
            manager Miss Augustine Sifert (Anne O'Neal) when she activated a
            burglar alarm, and a company security guard during their flight.
            They decided to remain together, and due to an intensive manhunt
            and dragnet and even involvement by the FBI, they were forced to
            flee to Southern California. The hunt for them tightened when 
			their spending of twenty dollar bills
          in the area was traced back to the Armour plant. Their <em>amour
              fou</em> ultimately led to their tragic end in a foggy swamp near Bart's rural hometown,
              brought down by their violent, jarring, reckless natures. 
            They collapsed on the ground and slept until dawn when they heard
            ominous footsteps and the voices of Bart's boyhood pals Deputy Clyde
            (Harry Lewis) and Dave (Nedrick Young) announcing their approach
            in the fog. In their last few moments of life
          and knowing that they were surrounded, Bart faithfully declared his
          love for Annie Laurie and gave her one final kiss. As the
          two came closer and Annie Laurie saw their figures in the fog, Bart
          was compelled to shoot his insane, aggressive lover as a mercy killing
          - the only murder he committed in the entire film. Mistakenly
          believing that Bart had fired on them, a barrage of police gunfire
          abruptly cut Bart down. With poetic justice, he fell next to her. Their
              bodies lay united together - with Bart on his back and Annie Laurie
              on her side. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Gunfighter (1950), </b>84 minutes, D: Henry
        King<br />
        Director Henry King's under-rated film was known as a seminal &quot;psychological&quot; western,
        semi-Greek tragedy, and noirish character study. It told about a cursed,
        notorious gunfighting outlaw with a bloody past. He was continually mythologized,
        looked at contemptuously, or targeted by many upstart gunslingers who
        wanted to challenge his reputation as the fastest gun in the West. This
        film was a glamorized account of a real-life, infamous historical gunfighter
        known as Johnny Ringo who probably shot unarmed men and was presumed
        to have committed suicide. In the movie version of the character, Ringo
        only killed in self-defense. In the film's opening set in the
        1880s, reformed, legendary but weary 35 year-old Jimmy Ringo (Gregory
        Peck) with a violent past (and an impressive mustache) arrived one night
        in a saloon in a small SW town. Cocky
            and arrogant gunman Eddie (Richard Jaeckel), a young bully thought
            to himself: &quot;Just two hands like anybody
            else.&quot; After self-defensively 
            killing  Eddie in the barroom, his 12th murder in similar circumstances,
            further forces were brought down upon Ringo. Subsequently, Ringo
            could not escape from Eddie's three vengeful murderous brothers who
            pursued him to the outskirts of town; there, he wounded one brother
            (David Clarke) who drew his gun, and disarmed the other two (Alan
            Hale, Jr, and John Pickard) before chasing off their horses; they
            faced a 3-hour walk to Santa Fe, NM. In the nearby town of Cayenne,
              NM in the early morning, Ringo entered an empty saloon, the
              Palace Bar, owned by bartender Mac (Karl Malden), who knew of Ringo
              and treated him with extreme deference. Ringo's old friend
            and ex-outlaw, now the town's reformed Marshal Mark Strett (Millard
            Mitchell) was alerted to the gunfighter's presence. The Marshal urged
            Ringo to leave town to avoid further trouble. While in town, Ringo
            hopefully awaited a reunion with his estranged wife (of eight years)
            - local schoolteacher Peggy Walsh (Helen Westcott) and their son
            Jimmie, Jr. (B.G. Norman) whom he had never met. According to the
            Marshal, she had kept her identity and son's identity a secret on
            purpose. Ringo found himself restricted, sequestered (and trapped)
            in the corner of the Palace Bar while he waited to speak to Peggy.
            At first, she refused to meet with Ringo when the Marshal asked her
            if she was interested in seeing him. After speaking
            to waitress-singer Molly Harris (Jean Parker), a recently-widowed
            saloon girl once married to Bucky Harris, one of Ringo's friends
            and gang members, she was able to convince Peggy to speak to him.
            Throughout Ringo's short stay in town, hot-shot, two-bit gunfighter
            and &quot;loud-mouthed,
            barroom loafer&quot; Hunt Bromley (Skip Homeier) had been lurking
            around Cayenne to confront him. Molly had earlier told Ringo that
            Bromley attempted to romance Peggy, but she had told him off. Bromley
            marched into the Palace Bar to purposely instigate a fight with Ringo,
            who cautioned the cocky young man to quit bothering him.  Ringo insulted
            Bromley (&quot;I heard about you. I heard you're a cheap, no-good
            barroom loafer&quot;), and then held a gun on Bromley under the table
            pointed at his belly, to force him to leave the bar room. It was
            revealed that Ringo had bluffed Bromley and thoroughly humiliated
            him. At the same time, Eddie's three murderous brothers had acquired
            horses and guns and were on their way to town to seek vengeance.
            During Ringo's long-awaited, delayed meeting with Peg before he had
            to leave town, he told her about his desire to set aside his past
            reputation and move westward to California or the Northwest to start
            a new life on a ranch - with her and Jimmie: (&quot;We could be safe
            out there the rest of our lives&quot;).
              She balked at the idea: (&quot;It's a wonderful idea, Jim. It's
              wonderful, but it's no use....It's too late&quot;), but if in a
              year's time, he had reformed and changed his ways, she promised
              to seriously reconsider his invitation again. Their conversation
              ended with Ringo's hopeful words: &quot;We can make it, honey.
          We can make it. You just wait and see.&quot; As
          he was about to finally leave town on horseback, later than he had
              expected in the film's conclusion, the 'gunfighter' was tragically
              felled (shot in the back) by multiple shots fired by Hunt Bromley.
              While dying, Ringo decided to tarnish the legend surrounding his
          life. He instructed Marshal Strett to tell the public 
              that he drew first on Bromley, and was shot in self-defense.  (If
              he didn't claim he drew first, Hunt would be hanged for murder,
              and his cursed legend would persist.)  He wanted to curse Bromley
              by teaching him what life would be like as a notorious 'fast-draw'
              gunslinger - he would forever be a shooting target. The Marshal
              manhandled &quot;yellow-belly&quot; Bromley,
              took him into a barn and beat him up. Before ordering him to
              leave the territory, he warned him that many other gunslingers
              would now want to challenge 'the man who killed Jimmie Ringo.'
              Ringo's funeral was attended by Peggy who openly revealed her marital
              association as Mrs. Ringo (with Ringo's son), thereby forgiving
              him and reconciling with him in death. The final shot was a silhouetted
              view of &quot;Ringo&quot; (although dead and buried) riding off
          into the sunset.</font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Harvey (1950),</b> 104 minutes, D: Henry Koster<br />
        Director Henry Koster's screwball comedy with fanciful elements 
            told about eccentric and cheerful, often inebriated and 42 year-old
            dipsomaniac Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) who had an invisible friend
            (identified as a &quot;pooka&quot; or mischievous Celtic-Irish spirit
            of mythology - &quot;a fairy spirit in animal form&quot;) - a giant
            6 foot three-and-a-half-inch rabbit named Harvey that accompanied
          him everywhere. He was oblivious that he was an embarrassment to his family and
          that others couldn't see his furry white friend. At 
          Elwood's large residential estate, his peculiar personality and
          insane behavior (including references to his invisible and silent friend
          Harvey) had obviously become an embarrassment to his family, including
          Elwood's eccentric older sister Mrs. Veta Louise Dowd Simmons (Josephine
          Hull), and Veta's unmarried daughter Myrtle Mae Simmons (Victoria
          Horne) - Elwood's niece. Elwood was   accused of continually
          driving people away due to his lunacy, and causing his family members
          to feel &quot;disgraced&quot; and become social outcasts, while
        preventing Myrtle from meeting eligible young men. As Veta and Myrtle
          were preparing a secret Wednesday afternoon tea party or forum (with
          a reception and social program) for some of the prominent members in
          the community, they worried that if Elwood returned home, he would
          spoil everything, disrupt the event and disturb their guests - and
          later their fears came true. Meanwhile, as Elwood had left home and
          walked about town, he carefully guided Harvey across a busy street,
          causing befuddlement amongst townfolk who saw him talking presumably
          to himself (they couldn't see his large furry white friend). He often
          spent time drinking in Charlie's Bar, where he ushered Harvey to a
          seat at the bar. The bartender Mr. Cracker (Dick Wessel) humored Elwood
          by acknowledging his friend and accepting his strange behavior. Elwood
          ordered two martinis, one for himself and one for Harvey. Although
          Veta questioned Elwood's sanity, she surprisingly and ironically occasionally
          could see Harvey and acknowledged his presence. Veta led efforts to
          get Elwood committed to an insane asylum, Chumley's Rest, run by Dr.
          William Chumley (Cecil Kellaway). She convinced Elwood to join her
          in a drive to the front of the gated institution. Inside the hospital
          while Elwood was being incarcerated, Veta spoke to Nurse Miss Ruth
          Kelly (Peggy Dow), and to attending young assistant physician Dr. Lyman
          Sanderson (Charles Drake) in his office. Veta insisted:
            &quot;I want him committed out here permanently because I cannot
            stand another day of that Harvey!&quot;  Due to her absurd insinuations
          about her brother and a rabbit, Dr. Sanderson thought that she was
            a mental case herself, and she was immediately admitted  
            for treatment instead of Elwood. Sanderson - who feared
            that he had acted in error and mistreated Dowd, informed his
            superior Dr. Chumley. Both thought that the
            hospital would be charged with false commitment, wrongful incarceration
            and rough treatment of Dowd, so Sanderson immediately released Dowd,
            but kept Veta for temporary observation. Shortly later, Dr. Chumley
            realized that Dowd was actually the insane one, and a town-wide search
            commenced for Elwood to return him to Chumley's. Meanwhile, Veta
            was delivered back to the Dowd house - she was hysterical and threatening
            to have  Judge Gaffney (William Lynn) sue the hospital for mistreating
            her. Four hours later, Elwood was
            eventually tracked down to Charlie's Bar but found alone. He had
            been talking to Dr. Chumley, and had magically convinced Dr. Chumley
            of Harvey's existence: (&quot;At first, Dr. Chumley seemed a little
            frightened of Harvey, but that gave way to admiration as the evening
            wore on&quot;). Elwood was grabbed and taken back to the sanitarium,
            where he met with Dr. Chumley privately in his office. Dowd bragged
            how Harvey had miraculous powers - he could stop time and magically
            send anyone to a destination. Dr. Chumley described a therapeutic
            dream trip he wished to take to Akron, Ohio. After
            all of the other characters arrived at the hospital (by cab), Dr.
            Sanderson recommended that Dowd could be cured of his third-degree
            hallucinations of the rabbit (&quot;to shock him back to reality&quot;)
            with a serum injection of &quot;Formula 977.&quot; Dowd politely agreed
            to the treatment to please his elder sister Veta, who vehemently
            objected to his initial refusal to be cured. But when Veta clearly
            saw that Dowd's cure would be worse than his ailment, she intervened
            to stop the injection. In the film's conclusion as Elwood left the
            facility on foot with Myrtle and Veta, Harvey briefly remained behind
            with Dr. Chumley (who asked: &quot;Have you ever been to Akron?&quot;), 
			but after an instantaneous trip of
            two weeks to Akron with the doctor, Elwood was joined by his trusted
            and preferred invisible friend Harvey as they walked
        out of the hospital's gates toward the bus stop. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Nicholas Ray<br />
            This mature, bleak and dramatic 1950 film noir from maverick director
            Nicholas Ray was based on  a complex script by Andrew Solt. It told
            about a volatile Hollywood screenwriter who became a murder suspect
            and was provided an alibi by his neighbor - an aspiring actress.
            World-weary, acerbic, cynical, self-destructive, hot-tempered, depression-plagued
            Hollywood screenwriter and, hard-living but laconic anti-hero Dixon
            Steele (Humphrey Bogart) was planning to adapt a trashy best-selling
            romance novel for the big screen. Dixon  met  simple-minded,
              naive, celebrity-obsessed hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson (Martha
          Stewart) at Paul's Restaurant. She was reading the novel that he would
              soon be adapting into a screenplay, so instead of reading the
              novel, he relied on a synopsis of the book from Mildred. She 
              was invited to his apartment in the late evening to provide him
              with an overview of the lightweight, second-rate
            book he hadn't read himself. At 12:30 am, Dixon offered Mildred cab
            fare instead of driving her home as he earlier had promised. The
            next morning, at 5:00 am, Dixon was accosted at his home by Beverly
            Hills detective Sgt. Brub Nicolai (Frank Lovejoy). Dixon was taken
            to the Beverly Hills Police Department to engage in a recorded interrogation
            with Brub's overzealous boss Police Captain Lochner (Carl Benton
            Reid). He was accused of murdering Mildred via strangulation, and
            then dumping her body by the side of the road. Dixon's beautiful
            but cool blonde next-door apartment neighbor and would-be starlet
            Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) was also called in for questioning in
            the detective's office. She provided an alibi for Dixon when she
            confessed that he did not leave with the murder victim when he said
            goodnight to the female   at his door. Later, Dixon complimented
            Laurel in providing a life-saving alibi based upon his attractive
            face, and they became mutually attracted to each other. Dix and Laurel
            began a love affair and they were initially happy, but tensions between
            them grew when the investigation into him persisted (and he was
            under secret surveillance), and she became increasingly suspicious
            and began to back away. She clearly saw him as a
            man whose own sur-'face' hid terrible, uncontrollable and ferocious
            anger, and feared that he was violent and capable of murder - possessing
            a &quot;sick mind with an urge to destroy.&quot;  A foreshadowing
            of the end of their own fragile affair occurred during a late-night
            drive, with Dixon's words to Laurel: &quot;I
            was born when she kissed me. I died when she left me. I lived a few
            weeks while she loved me.&quot;  Their romantic
            relationship was ultimately put to the test as she became increasingly
            suspicious of his disintegrating self. Out
            of fear, Laurel accepted Dixon's desperate and sudden marriage proposal,
            to avoid aggravating him or getting into an argument due to his inherent,
            explosive nature. However, she was seriously contemplating leaving
            town to avoid marrying him, and she hurriedly packed her bag inside
            her locked apartment's bedroom to leave. Dix forced his way in to
            her apartment and realized Laurel was packing
            - not for a honeymoon trip to Las Vegas - but to run away from him
            to New York. In a rage, he nearly strangled the woman he loved. He
             was only interrupted by a ringing telephone with a startling message,
            informing him that Mildred's boyfriend Henry Kesler (Jack Reynolds)
            had confessed to her murder. In the film's unhappy ending, it was
            too late to save their relationship. Laurel uttered teary, murmured
            words of goodbye to Dixon as he walked away after their relationship
            had completely deteriorated, and he disappeared through an outer
            archway to the street: &quot;I lived a few weeks while you loved
            me. Goodbye, Dix.&quot; </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Los Olvidados (1950, Mex.) (aka The Forgotten
                Ones, or The Young and the Damned)</strong>, 85 minutes, D: Luis
        Bunuel<br />
          Luis Bu&ntilde;uel's nihilistic and grim cautionary tale was one of
          the greatest, and harshest, socially-realistic films ever made. It
          was filmed in stark black and white cinematography, and was set in
          the slums of Mexico City populated by gangs of street kids. A juvenile
          delinquent gang in Mexico City led by amoral, older, violent reform
          school jail-escapee and miscreant El Jaibo (Roberto Cobo), committed
          horrific, sadistic acts of murderous brutality and petty crime, including
          the merciless robbery and beating of blind street musician Don Carmelo
          (Miguel Incl&aacute;n), and the destruction of his drum.  In the next
          sequence set near a half-built, high-rise building, Jaibo (in denim
          overalls) vengefully beat rival Julian (Javier Amezcua) to death by
          striking him from behind in the head with a large rock (hidden in a
          fake arm sling) and then stole his money, in retaliation for Julian
          allegedly reporting him to police and sending him to jail. The film's
          most sympathetic main character was the youngest gang member Pedro
          (Alfonso Mej&iacute;a) in Jaibo's gang; he was bribed (with some of
          Julian's stolen money) to not report Jaibo's act of murder. Pedro 
           prostituted himself to survive by accepting homosexually-pedophilic
            advances. Because he was the offspring of a rape, he was unloved
          by his widowed mother (Estela Inda) with four children. In a famous,
          unsettling surrealistic dream sequence (in slow-motion and chiaroscuro),
          Pedro had visions of Julian's blood-stained face and dead body under
          his bed (he had witnessed the murder) with chicken feathers floating
          in the air, and then he saw his unloving mother floating toward him
          with a large slab of rotting raw meat as a lightning bolt struck (she
          normally deprived him of food). Suddenly, Jaibo reached from under
          the bed with his long distended arm and snatched the meat, as the dream
          ended. To attempt to reform himself, Pedro took a 
          job as a blacksmith apprentice. There, he was wrongfully
          set up by Jaibo for a theft crime (of an expensive knife). Charged
          with the crime, Pedro was sent to a rehabilitation
            &quot;farm school&quot; center where he misbehaved and killed two
          chickens. To test Pedro's honesty, the school's  principal
              gave Pedro 50 pesos for an errand to purchase cigarettes. While
              on the way to buy the cigarettes, the menacing Jaibo stole the
              money, and the two boys got into a vicious fist-fight. Although
              the fight ended in a draw,  Pedro loudly
              announced that he had seen Jaibo kill Julian. The
              revelation was heard by blind street musician Don Carmelo, who
          reported it to police. As a result, Jaibo retaliated by tracking down
          and vengefully killing Pedro (during a brief, dark scene). Jaibo died
            when he attempted to escape and was shot with two gunshots by the
            police as he left the murder scene - (during his surrealistic death,
            a mangy stray dog ran toward the camera and was superimposed over
          his face as he swooned and died). Pedro's body was found by Meche and
            her grandfather, and to avoid the police, his corpse was gracelessly
            disposed of. It was put in a sack and carried out of town on a donkey,
            to be dumped down a garbage-covered cliff -- while Pedro's mother
          passed in the street, ironically not knowing her lost son was dead. </font></p></td>

        minutes, D: Jean Cocteau </font><br />
          <font size="2">Jean Cocteau's visually-beautiful, eccentric, surreal,
          romantic fantasy drama was set in post-war 1950s Paris - it was a retelling
          of the classic Greek Orpheus myth (about a musician's descent into
          the underworld to reclaim his dead wife). The title character was 
          light-haired, famous, handsome and popular Left Bank (Parisian) existentialist,
          middle-aged poet Orph&eacute;e or Orpheus (Jean Marais), who was obsessed
          with Death; he was married to his beautiful but unhappily neglected
          and pregnant wife Eurydice (Marie D&eacute;a). In the opening scene,
          Orphee was visiting inside the Caf&eacute; des Po&egrave;tes (Poet's
          Cafe) in modern-day Paris, talking about how younger resentful poets
          scorned his success. A black Rolls Royce pulled up outside commanded
          by the Princess (Maria Casares). It was driven-chauffeured by her assistant
          Heurtebise (Fran&ccedil;ois P&eacute;rier) - later revealed to be a
          man who had recently committed suicide by gassing himself to death.
          Orphee's poet rival, Jacques C&eacute;geste (&Eacute;douard Dermithe),
          patronized and supported by the Princess, emerged from the car. A chaotic
          brawl broke out inside and outside the cafe, and the drunken Cegeste,
          who broke free when he was being taken into custody by police, was
          struck and killed by two motorcyclists on the street. The Princess
          - representing, depicting and personifying Death (revealed later),
          ordered the transport of Cegeste's corpse in the Rolls Royce parked
          outside to the 'hospital', and firmly urged Orphee to accompany them
          as a 'witness.' The first of many cryptic radio messages was
          heard on the Rolls Royce's radio. After dark, the car was escorted
          by the Princess' two henchmen: they were male, helmeted motorcycle
          riders dressed in black leather and wearing high boots - they were
          the ones responsible for Cegeste's death. The car was driven to the
          ruins of an abandoned chateau, where the Princess magically revived
          or reanimated Cegeste from death. He and the Princess (and the two
          motorcyclists) passed into the Underworld (through a mirror), but Orphee
          was unable to follow after them. After returning home after being given
          a ride by Heurtebise, Orphee was told that Cegeste's body had mysteriously
              disappeared, and couldn't be located. He began
              to receive cryptic messages from Cegeste's spirit, as well as nocturnal
              visitations from the Princess who entered through his bedroom's
          mirror and watched him sleep. Orphee had invited Heurtebise
              to live in his house and to store the Rolls in the garage, where
              he sat in the vehicle and obsessively listened
              to the radio that was broadcasting abstract poetry and coded messages
          from the afterlife. As the film progressed, a love triangle developed
              between Orphee and the Princess (a symbol of Death) who visited
              him in his dreams, while the love-struck Heurtebise (the Princess'
          chauffeur) romanced Eurydice, Orphee's dead wife. Eurydice was struck
          down while riding her bicycle (off-screen) - she had been killed by
          the Princess's leather-clad motorcycle men and taken to the underworld.
           Orphee was advised by Death's chauffeur Heurtebise, a faithful guide,
          about how to enter the underworld through his bedroom mirror-portal
          - to return Eurydice to life. Orphee crossed into the dreamy underworld
          to reclaim Eurydice by passing through a glass mirror. Orphee was brought
          before a tribunal panel of judges for interrogation in the afterlife
          or underworld. The Princess was forced to admit the reason for illegally
            taking Eurydice (and breaching her authority) - it was because of
          her love for Orphee. The
            judges' decision was that Eurydice would be returned with Orphee
             to the living world, but only if he never looked upon her again.
          If he looked upon her, he would lose her again. Heurtebise was allowed
          to join them, to assist the couple with their new restrictive lives.
          In one of the film's most shocking moments, via the rear-view mirror,
          Orphee caught a brief glimpse of his wife Eurydice sitting in the backseat
          of the Rolls Royce parked in the garage, causing her to immediately
          disappear. Shortly later outside his home,
          Orphee was killed when accidentally shot by a member of a vengeful
             mob from the Cafe that accused him of murdering
          rival poet Cegeste. In the film's resolution, the deceased Orphee returned
            to the afterworld with Heurtebise, but was again sent back to the
            living world (by walking backwards in reverse) to be with Eurydice,
            with their memories erased. The &quot;immortal poet&quot; would soon
            become a father with his first child with Eurydice. Meanwhile, Heurtebise
          and The Princess/'Death' would now become judges in the Underworld.</font></p></td>

        Elia Kazan<br />
        Director Elia Kazan's noirish, dramatic psychological thriller was filmed
        entirely in the city of New Orleans, in a gripping tale of a tense chase
        after possibly infected criminals by a US physician and the authorities
        to curtail the spread of a potentially-deadly plague epidemic. In the
        semi-documentary dark plot, three gangster criminals, including a menacing
        Blackie (Jack Palance) and his two henchmen Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel)
        and Kochak's cousin Poldi (Guy Thonajan), were involved in the murder
        of Kochak (Lewis Charles) during a waterfront poker card game dispute
        on a New Orleans wharf. During a morgue autopsy on the corpse of the
         recently-arrived illegal alien (an unidentified Kochak), it was discovered
        and confirmed by US Public Health Service Lt. Commander Dr. Clinton Reed
        (Richard Widmark) that the deceased was a prime carrier of the 'pneumonic
        plague' (a variant of bubonic plague). While by-the-book, dim-witted,
        law-and-order Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) and Dr. Reed traced
        down Kochak's killer in a race again time, it was important to keep the
        incident top secret to prevent mass panic during their 48 hour search
        window. Clues such as rustproof paint and shrimp tracings, found on Kochak's
        clothing, led to the discovery that the dead man was a smuggled stowaway
        on the <i>Nile
        Queen</i>, a tramp steamer. During the case, the investigators discovered
        that Kochak was probably Armenian, liked shish-kabob, and had boarded
        the ship at Oran (in Algeria). They traced Kochak's wanderings to a Middle
        Eastern (Greek) restaurant owned by John Mefaris (Alexis Minotis), who
        denied knowing about Kochak until after his affected and contaminated
        wife Rita died. One of the killers, Blackie, suspected that his sidekick
        Poldi (who was very ill) received expensive, contraband smuggled goods
        from Kochak. Simultaneously, a persistent reporter was threatening to
        break the story in the morning paper - leaving only four hours remaining.
        In the film's concluding moments, a chase ensued by Reed (accompanied
        by the police) in pursuit of Blackie and Fitch (who had thrown Poldi
        to his death). The gunfight and pursuit began at a waterfront coffee
        warehouse, and went through depots, docks and a warehouse, and ended
        with Blackie accidentally shooting and wounding Fitch, and the police
        taking the two into custody. With the crooks apprehended, the pathogenic
        plague could be contained and restricted successfully. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Rashomon (1950, Jp.)</strong>, 88 minutes,
        D: Akira Kurosawa<br />
        Director Akira Kurosawa's cinematic, landmark masterpiece was about the
        nature of truth and the shaping of perceptions from different perspectives.
        This multi-layered film replayed (in flashback) the same crime story
        multiple times from different characters' eyes as they told incompatible,
            contradictory tales of a mysterious 'rape' and murder in the
          woods in 12th century feudal Japan. The film opened under the shelter
        of Rashomon (the ruined South gate to modern day Kyoto), during a steady
        downpour, as woodcutter Kikori (Takashi Shimura) told a
		 &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;horrible&quot;
            story (from three days earlier) to a commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) and
          temple priest Tabi H&#333;shi (Minoru Chiaki). He had discovered a
          murdered samurai nobleman while he was in the woods. In a marvelous
          moving tracking shot through the forest, the woodcutter first found
          four pieces of evidence (a woman's reed hat with veil, a samurai's
          cap, a cut-up piece of rope, and an amulet case) before he found the
          body. He reported his story to the police along with the priest, who
          reported that he saw the samurai traveling with his wife the day of
          the murder (or suicide). Then, they listened to the arrested and captured
          bandit who was injured (after being thrown from the samurai's stolen
          horse). The outlaw/bandit Taj&#333;maru (Toshir&#333; Mifune) told
          his version of the story. He watched from the cover of the dense forest
          when he glimpsed the wife Masako (Machiko Kyo). She was concealed under
          a large hat and veil, while led on a horse by her samurai husband (Masayuki
          Mori). When the bandit glimpsed her bare feet and the camera panned
          up to partially reveal her face through the open veil, he was awestruck
          by the sight and coveted her.  The bandit chased after them to confront
          them. He lied to the husband and led him deep into the woods where
          he attacked him (and tied him with a rope to a pine tree). He returned
          to the wife who fully opened her veil to him. He told her the samurai
          was sick. She turned pale and looked at him with &quot;frozen eyes.&quot;
          The bandit changed his feelings about her husband. He dragged
            the wife back into the forest, where the wife fiercely defended herself
            with an expensive dagger, but then exhausted, she yielded and let
          herself be seduced by the bandit.  The samurai was released and the
          two men dueled to the death over the wife's honor. The bandit killed
          the samurai, but then the scared wife ran away. In the wife's completely
          contradictory testimony, the &quot;docile&quot; woman claimed she yielded
          to the bandit (while her &quot;horrified&quot; husband was tied up)
          and then the bandit partially untied the husband and ran off. The wife
          was distraught that her cold and loathing husband wouldn't forgive
          her. She grabbed the dagger, cut the remaining ropes, held out the
          dagger and begged: &quot;Now kill me. Kill me at once.&quot; As the husband kept coldly
            staring at her, she fainted with the dagger in her hand. When she
          awoke, she found her husband dead with the dagger in his chest.  She
            somehow fled from the woods and attempted to commit suicide by throwing
          herself in a pond, but as she admitted: &quot;I failed to kill myself.&quot; In
           the samurai's testimony (via a medium), after the rape (with her &quot;virtue
          stained&quot;) while the samurai was still tied up, the wife begged
          (&quot;Take me wherever you want&quot;). She agreed to join the bandit
          and asked for the bandit to kill her husband.  The bandit was so shocked
          by his unfaithful wife's request that he asked the samurai (&quot;What
          do you want me to do with her? Kill her or save her?&quot;). The samurai
          was ready to pardon the bandit for his crime. At that moment, the wife
          fled and got away. The bandit set the samurai free. Left by himself,
          the samurai committed suicide with his wife's dagger by thrusting it
          into his heart, but later, it was missing from the scene of the crime
          (someone had removed it from his heart). Back at the Rashomon gate,
          the woodcutter's objective account contradicted the other three stories
          - he had seen both the rape and murder (but didn't testify because
          he didn't want to get involved). He claimed the bandit begged the samurai's
          wife to marry him (&quot;Marry me please! If you say no, I have no
          choice but to kill you&quot;), but she refused and instead freed her
          husband's rope with the dagger. The samurai told the bandit: &quot;I
          refuse to risk my life for such a woman&quot; and called her a &quot;shameless
          whore.&quot; The conniving wife called her reluctant husband &quot;weak&quot; and
          urged both men to fight for her love (&quot;A man has to make a woman
          his by his sword&quot;). When the two men began to duel for her, she
          hid her face in fear. The fight was actually not as bold, passionate,
          noble or dramatic as the bandit had recounted. However, the outlaw
          was able to kill the samurai, and afterwards, the fearful wife fled
          from him. As he left the scene, the bandit took the samurai's sword
          with him. In the epilogue, it was revealed that the reason
              the woodcutter was reluctant to testify was because he was also
            &quot;a bandit&quot; who had taken the pearl-inlaid dagger from the
            murder scene. However, he was redeemed in the eyes of the suspicious
            priest when the woodcutter revealed that his motives were not dishonest
            or selfish. He decided to adopt an abandoned baby - although he already
          had a family of six children. As the woodcutter walked home with the
            baby in his arms, leaving the Rashomon gate, the rainstorm stopped
            and the sun began to shine. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Rio Grande (1950)</strong>, 105 minutes,
        D: John Ford<br />
        This was the third of Ford's &quot;Cavalry Trilogy&quot; (the best of
        the three by most accounts) with John Wayne's third appearance in the
        trilogy, and a co-starring role by Maureen O'Hara (who would also appear
        with Wayne in Ford's future film <i><a href="quie.html">The Quiet Man
        (1952)</a></i> and three other films). In the plot, promoted, duty-devoted Lieutenant Colonel
        Kirby Yorke (John Wayne) was the commander at the remote
              outpost of Fort Starke in the summer of 1879; the area on the Texas
              frontier near the Mexican border (marked by the Rio Grande River)
              was threatened by renegade Apache Indians, who often would cross
              the river during guerrilla raids, and then retreat by recrossing
              the river to sovereign Mexican land, where the US Cavalry was disallowed
          from taking action. Yorke's son Trooper Jefferson &quot;Jeff&quot; Yorke
          (Claude Jarman, Jr.) whom he had not seen for 15 years, had been expelled
          from West Point's Military Academy as a cadet in officer's school after
          flunking mathematics. To Col. Yorke's surprise, Jeff had enlisted in
          the US army and was assigned to his father's outpost for service as
          a low-level cavalry trooper. The younger recruit
          Yorke was refused favoritism-treatment by his father, and then was
          warned about finding glory in the service. Yorke's estranged, socially-privileged
              southern wife Kathleen Yorke (Maureen O'Hara) of 15 years, also
              the mother of Jefferson, made an unexpected arrival with a supply
              wagon. Although the reunited couple wouldn't admit it and had their differences,
              they were secretly attracted to each other, but didn't want to
          show their renewed romantic feelings for each other. Kathleen was
          there to attempt to buy out her son Jefferson's US Army service for
          $100 in Yankee gold, to discharge him and return him home, although
              both Comm. Yorke and the green recruit objected - he insisted on
          not signing discharge papers and remaining at the post. There was also
          long-standing tension between Yorke and his wife due to the past torching
          of the crops and barns at Bridesdale, her plantation home in the Shenandoah
          Valley during the Civil War; years earlier. Due to Yorke's
              &quot;sense of duty,&quot; he turned cold toward her, and worried
              that they could never reestablish their relationship, as she continued
          to stubbornly insist on removing Jeff from his command.  Yorke's superior
              officer Gen. Sheridan (J. Carrol Naish), who had arrived at the outpost, ordered
              Yorke and his regimental troops to enter Mexico (by crossing the
          Rio Grande), to pursue and eliminate marauding Apaches. Although he
              objected to the improper command, he proceeded to comply to Sheridan's
              orders by first evacuating the outpost of women and children (including
              his wife) to seek refuge at nearby Fort Bliss, with young Jeff
          serving as their escort rather than staying with the main regiment. The
          western concluded with Commander Yorke ordering his troops to rescue
          the caravan from the outpost (including his wife and other innocent
          women and children) attacked by the Apaches, with a small group of
          young abductees taken away and held in a small Mexican village's church,
          across the Rio Grande. During the battle in which Jeff displayed his
          heroism and bravery, his father was wounded with an arrow in the chest.
          Jeff was  ordered to remove the arrow (&quot;Pull it out, Jeff.
          Go ahead&quot;) and help his father ride back to the fort (&quot;Son,
          help me to my horse&quot;) after the children were secured. The romantic
          relationship between Yorke (who was recovering from his wound) and
          his wife was rekindled as the film ended, and many of Yorke's regiment
          members, including Jeff, were commended for their dedication. </font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Seven Days to Noon (1950, UK)</b>, 94 minutes, D:
            John Boulting and Roy Boulting</font><br />
            <font size="2">This dramatic, atmospheric,
            tense and suspenseful thriller from two UK twin brother-directors,
            with an Academy Award for Best Screenplay, was filmed at the start
            of the Cold War (and Atomic Age). In the thought-provoking plot,
            rogue English scientist Professor John Willingdon (Barry Jones) sent
            a letter to the British Prime Minister - Honorable Arthur Lytton
            (Ronald Adam). It stated that he had stolen an atomic-nuclear bomb
            from his suburban government research facility (the Wallingford Research
            Centre), and threatened to detonate it in the center of London if
            the Government didn't announce the curtailment of further development
            of atomic weapons within &quot;seven days.&quot; He was distressed,
            disillusioned and troubled that his life's work had been put to an
            evil purpose. Special Scotland Yard agents, headed by Detective Superintendent
            Folland (Andr&eacute; Morell),
            and the military and police were deployed to investigate the threat
            by the seemingly-deranged, home-grown terrorist. It was confirmed
            that a small UR12 nuclear bomb was missing from the research centre
            - Willingdon was carrying it in a small bag/suitcase. Stephen Lane
            (Hugh Cross), Willingdon's loyal assistant and future son-in-law,
            joined the search. Meanwhile, Willingdon had not returned to his
            home to his wife Mrs. Willingdon (Marie Ney) or distraught daughter
            Ann (Sheila Manahan), and was attempting to disguise his appearance
            (by shaving his mustache and buying a different overcoat), and hiding
            out by renting a room from landlady Mrs. Peckett (Joan Hickson) in
            a boarding house for a night. During the city-wide hunt for Willingdon,
            he spent another night in the apartment of aging burlesque-actress
            Goldie Phillips (Olive Sloane). The media pressure forced the Prime
            Minister to publically announce over the radio the threat to the
            nation, and he ordered martial law and an immediate evacuation of
            the 12 square miles around Parliament, and the clearance of the city
            center commenced. Sensing that he was trapped, Willingdon returned
            to Goldie's apartment and took her hostage for a few days, until
            he was forced to flee when the house-to-house manhunt approached
            closer. He visited Westminster Chapel, a London church (still damaged
            from The Blitz) to meditate shortly before the deadline - noon on
            Sunday. He was apprehended there by Folland and Lane, but panicked,
            broke free and ran outside, where he was shot and killed by a soldier.
            The bomb was disarmed and dismantled by Lane just as the clock reached
            12 noon.</font></p>

              Hitchcock</font><br />
               <font size="2">Hitchcock's lesser, film noirish murder-mystery
               thriller, filmed in the UK, was based upon Selwyn Jepson's 1947
               novel that first appeared as a series of short stories in <i>Collier's
                   Magazine</i> in 1947. In the plot, American-accented, aspiring
                   actress Eve Gill (Jane Wyman), daughter of Commodore Gill
                   (Alastair Sim) and his estranged wife Mrs. Gill (Sybil Thorndike),
                   was enrolled at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA).
                   She was inexplicably and secretly dating a good friend - another
                   boyish-looking actor named Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd).
                   The unbalanced Jonathan confessed to her that he had just
                   been implicated in the murder of the husband of flamboyant,
                   West End musical comedy star and singer Charlotte Inwood (Marlene
                   Dietrich), his own secret lover. His account put the blame
                   on Charlotte, and it indeed appeared that Charlotte had framed
                   him. In a dramatized and very deceptive flashback (later proven
                   to be untrue), he claimed that Charlotte had come to his door,
                   wearing a blood-stained dress and confessing that she had
                   just killed her husband during a quarrel. In his account,
                   he described how he offered to go back to Charlotte's house
                   to get her a clean dress, and also to arrange the murder scene
                   to make it look as if there had been a bungled robbery. However,
                   he had to flee when Charlotte's lower-class, frequent pub
                   customer and dresser-maid Nellie Goode (Kay Walsh) appeared
                   and identified him. During an escape attempt in his car, Jonathan's
                   car briefly stalled as police pursuers pounded on his &quot;safety
                   glass&quot; windows that broke just as the car finally started. Frantic and on
                   the lam, Jonathan sought refuge with Eve, who was helped by
                   her father to hide Jonathan to evade police as an investigation
                   commenced. Eve also proceeded to try and prove that he was
                   innocent of the charges, while Charlotte (who returned to
                   her career) was presumed to be the guilty one. Nonetheless,
                   Jonathan became the prime suspect, but was he framed by Charlotte,
                    or was he really involved? While
                  'playing' amateur detective, Eve adopted several disguises
                   to avoid being identified (i.e., her most memorable impersonation
                   was as maid Nellie's cousin - Cockney maid Doris Tinsdale
                   who took Nellie's place). During the investigation
                   of the case, Eve learned that Charlotte had ended her relationship
                   with Jonathan - a motive to jealously commit murder,
                   and Charlotte was also having an affair with her manager Freddie
                   Williams (Hector MacGregor). Eve also found herself the victim
                   of Nellie's blackmailing scheme when she was forced to pay
                   more bribe money in order to continue the masquerade. Eve
                   also slowly began to fall in love with the genuine detective,
                   often-mumbling Inspector Wildred O. &quot;Ordinary&quot;
                   Smith (Michael Wilding). As the film began to reach its climax,
                   there were three exciting set-pieces: (1) to elicit a confession
                   from Charlotte during a garden party performance under a tent,
                   a bribed young boy walked down the aisle and onto the stage
                   to deliver a doll with a blood-stained dress to Charlotte,
                   (2) Eve also tried to blackmail Charlotte and goad her into
                   confessing; in a conversation that was broadcast via a hidden
                   microphone to the police, Charlotte admitted that she had
                   planned and conspired to kill her husband, but it was Jonathan
                   who had committed the deed (with Charlotte present), and (3)
                   in a spine-chilling and claustrophobic sequence while Jonathan
                   and Eve were hiding in a theater prop room below the stage,
                   he admitted that his earlier 'flashback' story was a lie -
                   he was the one who had smeared blood onto the dress, and was
                   goaded into jealously murdering her husband when Charlotte
                   ended her relationship with him and was preparing to marry
                   Freddie. Eve begged Jonathan to turn himself in, but then
                   he threatened  to kill her to prove his insanity. She calmly
                   pretended to help Jonathan escape, but then trapped
                   him inside a bolted-locked door and summoned the police. As
                   Jonathan was  pursued, he died when a heavy iron
                   safety curtain was dropped like a guillotine from above to
                   cut off his exit route. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b><a href="suns.html">Sunset Boulevard (1950)</a> (aka
                Sunset Blvd.),</b> 110 minutes, D: Billy Wilder<br />
            Writer/director Billy Wilder's witty and cynical black comedy  was
            about a famed silent film star who refused to accept the end of her
            stardom while attempting a comeback. The perverse, cynical film referenced
            silent star Gloria Swanson's actual career, with excerpts from one
            of her unfinished films (<em>Queen
            Kelly</em>, directed by Erich von Stroheim, one of the film's stars), cameos
            by other forgotten silent film stars (e.g., Buster Keaton), a cameo
            from columnist Hedda Hopper, and an appearance by Cecil B. DeMille,
            one of Swanson's earlier film directors. Some of the scenes were
            also set at the actual Paramount Studios. The
            film's opening was narrated in voice-over by a dead corpse - a
            victim floating face-down in a Sunset Boulevard gothic mansion's
              swimming pool. The dead man's voice belonged to aspiring, debt-ridden,
              down-on-his luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden), who
              - during a flashback - was forced to hide out at a secluded,
              decaying estate while hiding from creditors ready to repossess
              his car. There, he met the  faded,
              once-great film queen Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her
              butler/chauffeur Max (Erich von Stroheim). When the delusionary
              star offered to hire him  to write a script for her impending
              comeback for a screen version of <i>Salome</i>, the desperate writer
              manipulatively took advantage of her desire to return to fame by
              encouraging her false hopes and moving in as her 'kept man' gigolo.
              During his time at the mansion, Joe learned that Norma's false
              dreams and victimization were being encouraged by Max, who was
              writing forged fan letters to her. The ambivalent 'kept man' scriptwriter
              balanced his exploitative dependence upon the film star with romantic
              attention toward young script-reader Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson)
              at Paramount, creating a lethal situation. At one point in the
              film, Joe and Norma were summoned to Paramount Studios, where Norma
              believed she was utterly adored by her many fans as she met with
              her mentor Cecil B. DeMille (as Himself). However, the reason for
              the studio meeting was unrelated to Norma's presence - Paramount
              had only wanted to use her vintage automobile for a film. When
              Joe was eventually forced to confess to Norma that he had been
              lying to her about his secret relationship with Betty, and attempted
              to make her face facts about her career, Norma suffered a nervous
              breakdown. As the film approached the opening swimming pool scene,
              Norma shot and killed Joe - who fell into the swimming pool. The
              film came full circle as police and authorities were summoned to
              the mansion, where Norma disintegrated further into madness, and
              was unable to distinguish the difference between illusion and reality.
              She believed that the reporters, police, and columnists (with photographers)
              were there to create a newsreel about her, and document her major
              comeback. Norma descended her marble staircase, where she uttered
              the famous closing line: &quot;All right, Mr. De Mille, I'm ready for
            my close-up.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

            <strong><a href="winc.html">Winchester '73 (1950)</a></strong>, 92
          minutes, D: Anthony Mann </font><br />
          <font size="2">Director Anthony Mann's unique
            and classic, noirish black and white &quot;psychological&quot; western
            film was based on a story by Stuart Lake - and the first of eight
            films (five westerns) pairing James Stewart with director Mann. 
            It had all of the stereotypical attributes of an 'oater' (ie., a
            law-abiding town run by Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer), an exciting
            shoot-out rifle competition, a decisive poker card-game, a buckboard
            chase, Indians on the warpath attacking a besieged group of cavalry
            troopers, a shoot-out between desperados and a posse, a deadly saloon
            fight, a bank robbery, a frantic horse-chase, and a cliffside rifle
            duel to the death).
            Accompanied by his longtime friend-sidekick High-Spade (Millard Mitchell),
            a  hard-bitten frontiersman Lin McAdam (James Stewart) participated
            in a Fourth of July markmanship shooting contest in Dodge City, Kansas
            to win a prized 1873 Winchester
            repeating rifle. Although he won, the rifle was soon stolen by his
            surly, runner-up opponent - outlaw  'Dutch' Henry Brown (Stephen
            McNally). The film followed McAdam's dogged, revenge-seeking  
            search for the cursed and deadly weapon, the film's title character. Numerous
            plot storylines crossed during McAdam's vindictive and obsessed chase
            after the stolen fabled rifle and his dark nemesis.           In
            this tale of murder, revenge and deceit, the high-powered, famed
            rifle changed hands multiple times: from the murderous outlaw who
            first stole the gun, then to disreputable and immoral Indian gun
            trader Joe Lamont (John McIntire), to savage Indian brave-chief Young
            Bull (Rock Hudson!), briefly to young cavalry officer Doan (Tony
            Curtis!, billed as Anthony Curtis) and cantankerous old Army Sgt.
            Wilkes (Jay C. Flippen), to young, golden-hearted frontier saloon-hall
             girl Lola Manners' (Shelley Winters) cowardly fiancee Steve (Charles
            Drake), to a crazed, sneering and sociopathic-psychotic killer 'Waco'
            Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea), and then back to the outlaw before ending
            up in the hands of its rightful owner. </font><font size="2">The
            western concluded with a climactic shoot-out between Lin and 'Dutch'
            on a hilly rock cliffside - and the revelation that they were estranged
            brothers (and 'Dutch' - actually Matthew McAdam - had murdered their
            father by shooting him in the back).</font></p>          </td>
