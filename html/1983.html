          <p><font size="2"><b>Flashdance (1983), </b>95 minutes, D: Adrian Lyne<br />
          Adrian Lyne's R-rated sleeper hit was a musical romantic drama with
              energetic, highly-choreographed, fast-paced, glossy MTV-type, rock
              music-video style dance sequences and vignettes. The film featured
              a soundtrack of hit songs, and turned out to be an unexpected major
              box-office success and cultural touchstone, even though it was
              a formulaic, implausible Cinderella story. It brought marketing attention
         to two new fads: break-dancing and torn/cut-off-the-shoulder
         gray sweatshirts. In the story's opening, Pittsburgh steel-mill
          welder/ exotic bar dancer Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Owens (Jennifer
          Beals) was performing at Mawbry's Bar. The pretty,
          self-doubting 18 year-old worked by day as a
          Pittsburgh steelyard welder, and at night as an exotic dancer in a
          local blue collar, working-class bar. Living
          in the loft of a huge abandoned and converted warehouse, she also aspired
          to become a professional ballet dancer, and often exercised or performed
          vigorous dance routines. She initially entered reluctantly into a romance
          with her persistent, handsome, older, wealthy steel-mill boss Nick
          Hurley (Michael Nouri). During a seductive scene between them,
          she tantalized him  during a lobster dinner -
          while she was dressed in a black tux. She slowly nibbled and sucked
          soft pieces of seafood, and suggestively asked: &quot;What turns you
          on?&quot; In the film's climactic dance sequence,
            Alex (wearing a black leotard and ankle warmers) auditioned before
            the Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance and Repertory to
              the tune of the Oscar-winning Best Song &quot;Oh, What a Feeling!&quot; (sung
              by Irene Cara), and although she faltered, she was allowed to
              continue and was able to be accepted to the Conservatory. In
              a cliched, upbeat romantic conclusion, she was reunited outside
              by Nick with a handful of long-stemmed red roses, a twirl and a
              loving kiss in the freeze-framed, dialogue-less conclusion.</font></p>          </td>

                  minutes, D: Richard Marquand<br />
                  In this epic conclusion to the entire action-oriented, sci-fi <i>Star
                  Wars</i> Trilogy
                  Saga, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) had returned to his home
                  planet of Tatooine (with his two droids C3PO and R2D2) in an
                  attempt to rescue his space-pilot friend Han Solo (Harrison
                  Ford) (still in carbon freeze) from vile, hookah-smoking gangster
                  Jabba the Hutt, a grotesque and repulsive slug-like creature.
                  The Rebels were on the run, continually being driven from one
                  hiding place to the next. The evil Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid),
                  the Sith mastermind who had engineered the creation of the
                  Galactic Empire and the fall of Anakin Skywalker, was planning
                  the doom of the Rebellion by constructing a new, more powerful
                  Death Star space station - to be placed in orbit around the
                  forest moon of Endor, although it was falling behind schedule.
                  A daring escape attempt by Leia (Carrie Fisher) (disguised
                  as a bounty hunter) to free Solo from Jabba the Hutt failed,
                  resulting in her imprisonment as a harem slave-girl, along
                  with Chewie, Luke, and the droids, although they were able
                  to ultimately free themselves and destroy Jabba. Their next
                  plan was to rendezvous with the assembled Rebel Alliance (led
                  by Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams)), and mount a massive
                  attack on the Emperor and his new space station, which was
                  located orbiting the forest moon of Endor. (If the Rebel fighters
                  could penetrate its force field, they could target the space
                  station's main reactor and destroy it.) Meanwhile, Luke returned
                  to Dagobah, thinking he would finish his Force-training with
                  aging Yoda, but the Jedi Master soon faded into oneness with
                  the Force. Just before his death, Yoda had confirmed that the
                  Dark Lord Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones) was Luke's
                  father - and a ghostly image of Ben (Obi-Wan Kenobi) (Alec
                  Guiness) revealed that Luke's twin sister was Leia. (Ben also
                  explained that what he had told Luke before was true - that
                  Anakin Skywalker was for all intents and purposes 'killed'
                  when he became Darth Vader.) Solo, Leia, Luke, 
				  the two droids, and Chewie engaged in a dangerous
                  mission to Endor, where they were aided by furry bear-like
                  alien creatures known as Ewoks. A climactic duel pitted Luke
                  against his father Darth Vader one last time, as the evil Emperor
                  watched their struggle. Luke did not kill Vader when he had
                  the chance. Although mortally-wounded, Vader made a redeeming
                  choice to save Luke and kill the Emperor (who was threatening
                  Luke with purple bolts of lightning and slowly killing him),
                  in order to save his son. Vader/Anakin Skywalker heaved the
                  Emperor's body into an abyss, where he was torn apart by the
                  Death Star generators, and then, after renouncing the Dark
                  Side of the Force - and  with the redeemed face of Anakin
                  Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw), Vader died in his son Luke's arms.
                  With the Death Star's shield deflector destroyed, the Rebels
                  commenced an attack on the unprotected Death Star's main reactor,
                  and the space station was obliterated. Meanwhile, Luke had
                  taken an Imperial shuttle and escaped from the exploding Death
                  Star with his father's corpse, and that evening on the forest
                  moon of Endor (as the rebels celebrated the destruction of
                  the Death Star, their ultimate victory over the Empire, and
                  the demise of the Emperor), Luke privately burned his father's
                  armored body in a funeral pyre. On Endor, the Rebels
                  celebrated their victory  as Luke looked at the happy,  reunited
                  ghost-spirits of Ben &quot;Obi-Wan&quot; Kenobi, Jedi master
                  Yoda and then Anakin (his father) smiling upon him.</font></p></td>

              Brickman<br />
              Writer/director Paul Brickman's debut film was an effective, satirical
              and well-received teen, coming-of-age sex comedy that equated the
              rewards of sexuality and a successful capitalistic Horatio Alger-like
              enterprise. The main character was Glencoe, Chicago suburbia-dwelling,
              college-bound high school Joel Goodson (Tom Cruise), who was faced
              with a few major pressures - losing his virginity, getting admitted
              to college, and becoming a successful businessman. Joel received
              repeated advice from his prankster friend Miles Dalby (Curtis Armstrong)
              to live freely: &quot;Sometimes
              you gotta say, 'What the f-k.' Make your move....Every now and
              then say, 'What the f--k.' What the f--k gives you freedom. Freedom
              brings opportunity. Opportunity makes your future&quot; - it was
              especially good advice to use during Joel's upcoming parents' one-week
              vacation trip to Europe: (&quot;What the f--k.' If you can't say
              it, you can't do it&quot;).  Joel decided  to experience
              a good time while his materialistic, strict parents were away,
              including the film's most memorable sequence - Joel's exhibitionist-karaoke
              scene, including his floor-sliding entrance into the front hallway
              while solo dancing, wearing white socks, a long-sleeved
              button-downed pink-striped shirt, and tight cotton underwear, as
              he lip-synched (and air-guitared) to the tune of Bob Seger's &quot;Old
              Time Rock &amp; Roll&quot; in his family's living room. At school,
              Joel was participating in an extracurricular group
              called Future Enterprisers of America - as a competing
              team, his goal was to create a small business company and product
              (and market it) - so that it would look good on his record for
              college (Princeton preferably, according to his father's and mother's
              wishes). Exhibiting extreme worry about his manhood and his future,
              Joel phoned a referral contact - a call-girl/prostitute named Lana
              (Rebecca DeMornay), and that evening -
              during an erotic, dream-like sequence, she appeared in his living
              room for sex. The two found themselves fleeing from her crazed
              and angry, gun-wielding &quot;manager&quot; (or
              pimp) Guido (Joe Pantoliano). She and her hooker friend
              Vicki (Shera Danese) were able to seek refuge at Joel's house.
			  Lana proposed an idea to Joel - he could raise a lot of money in
			  just a few days - by matching up his friends with her friends,
			  and she even suggested she'd be his girlfriend for free. After
			  an accident resulted in the destruction of his father's $40,000
			  Porsche in Lake Michigan, and for his insubordination, Joel received
              a 5-day suspension from school (for his unexcused absence) and
              was thrown out of Future Enterprisers, Joel was forced to accept
              Lana's suggestion - he marveled at her ability to organize and
              profitably transform his house into a make-shift brothel (with
              her many call-girl co-workers), to make him a successful entrepreneur
              sharing in the profits. He was amazed by her capitalist risk-taking
              skill: (&quot;It
              was great the way her mind worked. No guilt, no doubts, no fear....None
           of my specialties. Just this shameless pursuit of immediate material
           gratification. What a capitalist. She told me I could make more money
           in one night than I'd make all year&quot;). In
           the midst of a party held on Friday night (with the hookers and Joel's
           high-school friends), Joel was interrupted by Princeton University
           recruiter Bill Rutherford (Richard Masur) for a pre-arranged appointment-interview
            for admission. In a daring and risky late-night scene after the
            party, high-class hooker Lana and Joel became sex-exhibitionists
            during a deserted, elevated CTA subway ride. In the conclusion,
            Lana's menacing pimp Guido (with Vicki) stole all the furniture
            in Joel's house as pay-back (during the possible 'set-up' by Lana
            to take him away on the train during the night), forcing Joel to
            buy it back and move it all back into the home with the help of
            his friends just before his parents arrived later that Saturday
            from the airport in a taxi. The film's ending quote proved Joel's
            business prowess and his successful dealings in &quot;human fulfillment&quot; -
            he had become a  wealthy entrepreneur overnight , had won the
            school club's competition, and also had been admitted to Princeton
            as an Ivy League college-bound graduate. The film's last line
            (voice-over): &quot;My name is Joel Goodson. I deal in human fulfillment.
            I grossed over eight thousand dollars in one night. The time of your
            life, huh, kid?&quot;</font></p>          </td>

            <font size="2">In this mystery cop thriller-drama, small technicalities
              in the law (such as illegal search and seizures, forbidden by the
              4th Amendment) were hindering the pursuit of justice. Conscientious
              LA Judge Steven Hardin (Michael Douglas) was becoming increasingly
              frustrated when he had to disregard crucial evidence in cases where
              confirmed criminals were breaking the law, but were defended by
              clever defense lawyers who knew all the loopholes. There were two
              shocking cases of the miscarriage of justice: (1) killer Hector
              Andujar (Domingo Ambriz) murdered five old women (for their welfare
              checks), but then the case was dismissed regarding the illegal
              seizure of the murder weapon in his garbage, and (2) marijuana
              was suspected in the van (with unpaid parking tickets and warrants)
              of Lawrence Monk (Don Calfa) and Arthur Cooms (Joe Regalbuto),
              where the bloody shoe of young murder victim Danny Lewin was found;
              however it was ruled that the police were unlawful in stopping
              the van with no probable cause, because the computer had erroneous
              information. In anger and devastation, Danny's father Dr. Harold
              Lewin (James Sikking) attempted to take the law into his own hands
              and kill the two child murderers Monk and Cooms in the court, but
              injured a police officer instead. The distraught father committed
              suicide in jail. Mentor and fellow Judge Benjamin Caulfield (Hal
              Holbrook) inducted the disillusioned Hardin into the Star Chamber,
              an underground group of nine embittered judges who met in secret
              to retry cases as modern-day vigilantes (judge, jury, and executioner),
              with one basic premise: if found guilty, the accused were to be
            assassinated by hired killers. Monk and Cooms were discovered to
              be not guilty by police Detective Harry Lowes (Yaphet Kotto). However,
              the Star Chamber had already ruled that the two men were to be
              targeted, and the hit could not be withdrawn. Desperate to stop
              the unwarranted murder of two innocent men (even though they were
              despicable and had committed other crimes, such as child pornography
              and drug dealing), Judge Hardin went rogue and attempted to track
              down the two and warn them. When he came upon them in an abandoned
              warehouse, they were in the midst of an illegal drug operation,
              and they didn't believe him. Although threatened with his life,
              Hardin was saved by the hitman (disguised as a police officer)
              who killed Monk and Cooms. Then, Hardin himself escaped death when
              Lowes arrived and killed the hitman. In the brief epilogue, Hardin
              and Lowes were attempting to bring down the Star Chamber by wire-tapping
        its illegal activities. </font></p></td>

            Eastwood<br />
          This was the fourth &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; film (and the highest
            grossing film of the series extending for 17 years from 1971 to 1988),
            and noted as the only one that was directed by star Clint Eastwood.
            The violence-ridden, seamy and grim movie was another iteration of
          Eastwood's contemptuous, anti-heroic character of a 'wild West' vigilante-law
          enforcer Harry Callahan on the loose who consistently defied authority,
          legal guidelines and bureaucratic policies and his superiors in an
          urban setting. This was the film noted for its classic diner-coffee
          shop scene in which Harry single-handedly foiled a robbery by four
          black suspects and issued his famous trademark warning: &quot;Go ahead,
          make my day.&quot; There were a number of other set-pieces or vignettes
          with little relationship to the main plot. Harry crashed the wedding
          of the grand-daughter of crime boss Threlkis (Michael V. Grasso) and
          caused the mobster to have a heart attack, was chased by three punks
          who threw molotov cocktails into his car before their car plunged into
          the bay and they drowned, and eliminated Threlkis' mobster hitmen who
          tried to seek retribution by murdering him. In
          the film's main story, set in May of 1983, artist/painter Jennifer
          Spencer (Sondra Locke) was vengefully tracking down - one by one -
          and executing an unpunished gang of five men and one nasty, ultra-butch,
          crude-talking lesbian (named Ray Parkins (Audrie J. Neenan)) who had
          raped her and her sister Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; (Lisa Britt) a
          decade earlier, leaving her sister completely catatonic and hospitalized.
          The brutal rapes had occurred in her coastal seaside resort town of
          San Paulo (a semi-disguised Santa Cruz, CA) at the beach under the
          boardwalk area. After running afoul of the law, SF homicide detective
          Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) was ordered to take an &quot;R &amp; R&quot; vacation
          to San Paulo, to look into information on the first of Jennifer's murder
          victims, George Milburn (Michael Maurer). The killings were committed
          with a specific <i>modus
              operandi</i> (&quot;a .38-caliber vasectomy&quot; -  shots to the
              groin and head). Harry also found himself at odds with local San
              Paulo police chief Lester Jannings (Pat Hingle) in the small resort
              town who inexplicably was uncooperative, and became involved investigating
              further homicides in town with the same MO, after he single-handedly
              confronted a bank robber in town during an aborted heist. Callahan
              met Jennifer who was working in her hometown to restore the amusement
              park's carousel, while she was vengefully targeting the members
              of the gang. When she was about to kill one of her last targets,
              Sheriff Jannings's catatonic son Alby Jannings (Matthew Child),
              she was ambushed by Mick (Paul Drake), the most vicious psychopath
              in the group of rapists. Mick, accompanied by two Kruger brothers:
              Eddie (Russ McCubbin) and Carl (Robert Sutton), killed Chief Jannings
              (using Jennifer's gun to frame her) and then abducted Jennifer.
              The threesome dragged her into the deserted amusement park fairground
              and boardwalk to relive her rape experience. The bruised and beaten
              Callahan suddenly appeared on the boardwalk, seemingly back from
              the dead, and killed the two brothers. Mick held Jennifer as a
              protective shield, but Harry was able to blast him with four shots,
              causing Mick to fall backwards through the roller coaster's wooden
              railing and crash through the roof-top of the spinning carousel
              far below. He met his deserved fate by being phallically-impaled
              on the horn of one of the wooden unicorns on the carousel. As the
              film concluded, Jennifer's .38 Colt Detective Special hand-gun
              (used for all of her revenge killings) was found on Mick's body.
              Callahan compassionately took advantage of the opportunity to cover
              up Jennifer's vengeful crimes and pin the serial killings on Mick. </font></p>

              minutes, D: James L. Brooks<br />
              This comedy/drama classic, an entertaining film was also a manipulative,
              soap-operatic melodramatic tearjerker, with an ending similar to <a href="dark.html"><i>Dark
              Victory (1939)</i></a> and <a href="love.html"><i>Love Story (1970)</i></a>.
              Its tagline was: &quot;Have you come to <i>Terms</i> yet?&quot; The
              feel-good, box-office hit from writer/director/producer James L.
              Brooks (his first directorial effort) was based on the novel of
              the same name by Larry McMurtry. It was a major Academy Award winner
              in 1983, with eleven nominations and five Oscars (including Best
              Picture, Best Actress, and Best Director). A
              sub-par sequel, titled <i>The Evening Star (1996)</i> found Shirley
              MacLaine reprising her role fifteen years later, as a grand-mother
              to her daughter Emma's three children, and Jack Nicholson with
              only a short cameo appearance.  The 1983 fim told about the
              thirty-year mother-daughter relationship between two women: stubborn
              brunette Emma (Debra Winger) and her devoted, possessive, blonde,
              widowed mother Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine). They endured
              Emma's marriage, separation, and illness. As a young adult, the independent-minded
              Emma rebelled against Aurora's attentions, and against her advice
              married literature student Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels), and then
              moved with her family  from Houston, TX to Des Moines, IA. While
              the young couple suffered from unpaid bills, young mother Emma
              also discovered that her feckless husband, a college literature
              professor, was unfaithful and sleeping with one of his graduate
              students; she retaliated with her own brief affair with a timid
              Iowa bank officer Sam Burns (John Lithgow). Meanwhile, Aurora
              also engaged in a hilarious romance with her next-door neighbor
              - boozy, beer-bellied, over-the-hill, former astronaut Garrett
              Breedlove (Jack Nicholson). Their relationship was the comedic
              highlight of the film - the self-indulgent, horny playboy's flirtatious
              womanizing with reluctant, stiff and similarly middle-aged Aurora
              was hilarious. Their first, much-delayed luncheon date ended with
              a drunken ride into the Gulf of Mexico in his open-roofed Corvette.
              Soon after, she invited him over to her bedroom to look at a Renoir
              painting - her pretext for &quot;lights-off&quot; sex. In the heartbreaking,
              unexpected, tragic, cathartic and touching finale, Aurora's 30
              year-old daughter Emma was diagnosed with terminal cancer and then
              hospitalized. She was slowly reconciled with her mother during
              her illness. During an emotional hospital scene, Aurora went beserk,
              panicked and shrieked as she demanded that the nurses give her
              dying daughter her overdue shot of morphine: &quot;GIVE MY DAUGHTER
              THE SHOT!!&quot; Before her death in her Lincoln
              General Hospital room, Emma had one last hospital goodbye scene with
              her children - her distant, bratty, over-critical oldest son Tommy
              (Troy Bishop), after her youngest son Teddy (Huckleberry Fox).
              Soon after, Emma expired with one final glance at Aurora as Flap
              slept unawares. During the final end credits
            scene set at Aurora's house after the funeral, Garrett  
            proved his decent, sensitive and fatherly nature when he provided
            needed support and paid special attention to Emma's long-neglected
            older boy Tommy: (&quot;Good-lookin' suit there&quot;) and won over
            the reluctant boy; meanwhile, Aurora spent time with young Melanie
            (Megan Morris).</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Videodrome (1983)</strong>, 87 minutes, D:
              David Cronenberg<br />
           Director David Cronenberg's film was a terrorizing and shocking hallucinatory
           tale of erotic science fiction and &quot;body horror.&quot; The film's
           theme was the prophetic prediction that TV would replace 'real-life',
           as conspirators in a nightmarish cult wanted to entice (control and
           manipulate) the docile, consumer-oriented masses by marathon television
           watching (of extreme sex and violence). It involved kinky sexuality,
           extreme S&amp;M and orgiastic mutilation, and reality-manipulating
           TV. One memorable phrase was: &quot;Long live the new flesh.&quot; In
              the story, seedy Max Renn (James Woods) was the sleazy
            owner-director-producer of an X-rated Toronto cable TV station (Channel
             83). He discovered a pirated, ultra-violent, Pittsburgh underground
             TV show called <i>Videodrome</i> on a VCR cassette - the reason
             for the film's title; it was  a depraved torture/snuff
            film. The station aired soft-core pornography and violent content,
             and Renn desired to broadcast the pirated VCR cassette. Renn didn't
             know that he was being used by the  villainous political forces
             behind <i>Videodrome</i> - the Spectacular Optical Corporation (and <i>Videodrome's</i> producer),
          headed by Chief of Special Programs Barry Convex (Leslie Carlson).
          Renn was deceived into becoming mind-controlled and infected, by watching
          (and becoming hooked on) <i>Videodrome; </i> Spectacular Optical's
          goal (with the motto &quot;Keeping An Eye on the World&quot;) was to
          seize and take over Renn's Channel 83 TV station to broadcast its signal
          to the masses (&quot;It can be a giant hallucination machine, and much
          much more!&quot;). A mind-controlled Renn began
          to become infected due to his own TV watching (that seduced and controlled
          him), leading to his brain mutating and developing fatal tumors, and
          he was experiencing many disturbing, mind-altering visions and sights.
          Exposure to the <i>Videodrome</i> film caused carcinogenic tumors that
          triggered hallucinations in Max. Sexual imagery included a vaginal-like
          slit or womb-wound orifice that opened in his abdomen (into which he
          could insert videocassette tapes, or his entire hand holding a gun)
          as he became an organic video-recorder. He could be both &quot;raped&quot; and &quot;programmed&quot; by
          the villains forcefully inserting videotapes inside his body to &quot;play&quot; 
          him. In the film's most notable scene, Max watched a videocassette
            of <i>Videodrome's</i> origins on his TV set (including the strangulation
            of <i>Videodrome</i> technology cult leader and pioneer Professor
            Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley) when he learned
                of Spectacular Optical's malicious intentions), revealing the
            black-hooded executioner as Nicki - his future 'girlfriend'. She
            beckoned Max: &quot;Come to me now. I'm Nicki. Don't keep me waiting.&quot; In the film's
            most stupendous, surrealistic scene, her seductive red lips enlarged
            on his TV screen (the set itself undulated, pulsated, formed engorged
            veins, and moaned as if sexually-aroused). He submissively fell to
            his knees and pushed his own lips into the enlarged and bulging hallucinogenic
            TV screen image to kiss them -- a symbolic metaphor for oral sex
            (cunnilingus), as he was sucked into the glass monitor's image. Renn
            also engaged in a torrid and bizarre S&amp;M romance with self-help
            radio guru-personality Nicki Brand (rock star Deborah Harry or Blondie)
            - their first encounter in Max's apartment when she proposed &quot;Wanna
            try a few things?&quot; revealed her interest in masochistic sadism (piercing her body with a long
            needle, and burning her bare breast with Max's cigarette) and voyeurism
          when she encouraged him to play the cassette &quot;Videodrome.&quot; Renn
          was ordered by Convex to &quot;kill your partners and give me Channel 83&quot; - in order
               to take over the channel (and broadcast <i>Videodrome</i> as part
               of a crypto-government conspiracy to morally and ideologically &quot;purge&quot; North
               America and produce fatal brain tumors in &quot;lowlifes&quot; fixated
               on extreme sex and violence); however, Renn was soon after deprogrammed
               and ordered to reverse himself, and instead kill the creators
               and manipulators of <i>Videodrome</i> (&quot;Death to Videodrome.
               Long live the new flesh&quot;). Afterwards, Renn assassinated
                political leader Harlan (Peter Dvorsky), his own technical colleague,
               by transforming his hand into a slimy gun-grenade. Renn also
            murdered Barry Convex at the Spectacular Optical trade show at the
              Toronto Convention Centre - he shot him with his organic gun that
            caused tumors to erupt from his torso and skull. In the conclusion,
               Renn was convinced to ultimately take his own life to ensure the
               total and complete destruction of <i>Videodrome</i> - first, Nicki
               prompted him to kill himself by having him watch a TV broadcast
               of himself blowing his own head open, causing the TV set to explode;
               then, Renn committed an imitative suicide
               with his own organic hand-gun, and as he pulled the trigger for
            real, he proclaimed: &quot;Long live the new flesh.&quot;</font></p>          </td>
