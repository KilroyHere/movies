            minutes, D: Vincente Minnelli<br />
            Director Vincente Minnelli's acerbic and scathing show-business related
            melodrama and dark expose of sordid backstage Hollywood  was one
            of many films about Hollywood (such as <a href="sull.html"><i>Sullivan's
            Travels (1941)</i></a> and <a href="suns.html"><i>Sunset Boulevard
            (1950)</i></a>). It was based on scriptwriter Charles Schnee's Oscar-winning
            adaptation of George Bradshaw's short story &quot;Memorial to a Bad
            Man,&quot; that told about a scheming film producer. It won five
            of its six Oscar nominations. In the film's opening, most of the
            main characters (an actress, a writer, and a director) were gathered
            together in the office of film studio executive and &quot;B&quot; picture
            producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) at the old Shields Studio:
            director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan), star actress (originally a
            rehabilitated drunk) Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), and widowed,
            award-winning Southern novelist-screenwriter James Lee Bartlow (Dick
            Powell). After all three had furthered their careers and had become
            successes - they had one thing in common - all of them had earlier
            been manipulated and ruthlessly victimized by ambitious, cruel, driven,
            amoral, and egotistical film producer Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas);
              but now they had been asked to join the despised but irresistible
              Shields on his next production and film project, but each of them
              hated him for different reasons. In flashback,  the viewpoints
              and pasts of Shields' three former associates were told, detailing
              how he had betrayed, double-crossed, and caused them emotional
              pain; they all disowned him and hoped that he would fail in the
              future. In the first flashback, Shields was shown as beginning
            his ruthless and opportunistic rise to power as a maker of quickie,
            low-budget westerns and horror films; Shields had tricked Harry Pebbel
            (and his production unit) into hiring him as a producer, while Fred
            Amiel directed several &quot;B&quot; movies;
              as time went on, Shields began to substitute his own ideas, and
              then in a picture written by Amiel, Shields double-crossed him,
              chose a different more famous director, Von Ellstein (Ivan Triesault),
              and stole his idea. In the second flashback, the daughter of a
              famous Hamlet stage actor, Georgia Lorrison (Lana
          Turner), was a drunk until Jonathan Shields rehabilitated her and made
          her a movie star; unfortunately, she fell in love with Shields, and
          thought he loved her in return. Following the premiere of her debut
              performance in his film, movie star Georgia entered  the producer's
              mansion with a giant bottle of champagne to celebrate - and then
              Georgia shockingly discovered she had been betrayed by producer
              Jonathan's affair with starlet magazine cover-model Lila (Elaine
              Stewart). Jonathan delivered a hateful diatribe against the
            very vulnerable Georgia - viciously lashing out and berating her.
              In the subsequent, incredible freak-out scene following Georgia's
              suicidal reaction to Jonathan's insults - she ran from the luxury
              mansion, entered her car,  recklessly drove off in a raging
            downpour,  spun out of control, slammed on the brakes (an inset close-up
              of her high-heeled shoe) and screamed, as her automobile lurched
              and hurtled around and finally came to rest on the side of the
            road. In the third flashback, young college professor and
            novelist James Bartlow was brought to Hollywood with his faithless,
            flirtatious southern belle wife Rosemary (Oscar-winning Gloria Grahame),
            to adapt his latest best-selling book into producer Shields' film;
            to get Bartlow's distracting wife out of the way, Shields paired
            her up  with Latino actor Victor &quot;Gaucho&quot; Ribera
            (Gilbert Roland) to take a romantic trip to Mexico; the entire affair
            ended in tragedy when their private plane crashed and both were killed.
            After Shields decided to take over the direction of the film (his
            first directorial effort), it became a disaster - the studio went
            bankrupt and he lost the studio. The final scene was of director
            Amiel, actress Georgia and screenwriter Bartlow eavesdropping together
              on one telephone receiver - listening to the trans-atlantic conversation
              between Pebbel and the exiled Shields calling from Paris three
      years later - should they help him or not?</font></p>      </td>

      Director Howard Hawks' least-known adventure-western (his second), a slow-moving
      episodic story, was based upon A.B. Guthrie Jr.'s best-selling 1949 novel
      of the same name and scripted by Dudley Nichols. Its beautiful black and
      white cinematography showcased the grandeur of Grand Teton National Park,
      and the camaraderie of men heading into frontier territory danger. In 1832,
      frontiersman-trapper Jim Deakins (Kirk Douglas) partnered
       with racially-prejudiced, impetuous drifter Boone Caudill (Dewey
       Martin), a brawling fugitive who had been falsely accused of a
        crime. Becoming friends, they continued together to St. Louis. After
      Boone and Jim were jailed for instigating a barroom brawl with Missouri
      River Company owner Sam Eggleston (Fred Graham)
      and some of his workers, they encountered a cellmate - alcoholic, grizzled,
       old-timer trapper Zeb Calloway (Arthur Hunnicutt) (a half-Indian
      and Boone's uncle) - the film's narrator.  The group of
       jailbirds was bailed out by 'Frenchy' Jourdonnais (Steven Geray),
       the owner of a keelboat (named 'Mandan'), who paid their fines
        and immediately hired them for a fur-trading expedition 2,000 miles into
      the  &quot;wild and unexplored&quot; upper Missouri River (and
      Yellowstone River) - a territory of threatening Blackfoot Indians.  'Frenchy'
      had brought along young Indian princess-female Teal Eye (Elizabeth Threatt,
      a half-Cherokee in her sole film), the daughter of a Blackfoot chief, to
      negotiate with the Indians at their destination and establish fur trade
      with them - in competition with the Missouri River Company. The expedition's
      journey was plagued by dangerous white water rapids, competing rival
       fur traders headed by ruthless company boss Louis MacMasters (Paul
       Frees) and led by mercenary saboteur Streak (Jim Davis), and a deadly
      attack by hostile Crow Indians on the warpath. Once the expedition reached
      its destination, Teal Eye escaped to her tribe and to her father Blackfoot
      Chief Red Horse (Theodore Last Star), and then summoned the tribe to greet
       the keelboat. Meanwhile, a rival love
       triangle had obviously developed between Teal Eye, Jim and Boone.
       Zeb watched as Teal Eye approached the two men and gave Jim a gift
        - regarding him and loving him like &quot;an adopted brother,&quot; while
        at the same time making romantic gestures toward Boone. As Boone later
        exited her teepee to the noisy sounds of a tribal ceremony, Zeb announced
        to him: &quot;You're a married man now.&quot; Boone  was obligated to
        negotiate with Teal Eye's father to purchase her - as was the local custom,
        so that he would be free to leave with her. However, as plans were made
        to travel southward down-river back to St. Louis; Boone chose to leave
        with the other men and left Teal Eye standing on the shore. In the film's
        final moments during camp the first evening, Boone changed his mind and
        decided to return to the Indians to be with Teal Eye and to live with
        her amongst the Blackfoot.</font></p></td>

          minutes, D: Roberto Rossellini<br />
      Roberto Rossellini's evocative and bold post-war, social-realism film was
      his second collaboration with his American wife/actress Ingrid Bergman,
      following <i>Stromboli (1950, It.)</i>. At the time of filming, their marriage
      faced considerable controversy due to Bergman's adulterous decision to
      leave her husband and daughter for Rossellini. Due to some of the film's
      controversial elements, it was severely edited (or censored) by the Italian
      government. The plot told about wealthy Irene Girard (Ingrid Bergman),
      an American living in Rome. Intense guilt and grief followed the suicidal
          death of her sensitive-minded, troubled, 12-year old  son Michele
          Girard (Sandro Franchina) (who felt neglected by his mother). After
          deliberately falling down their apartment stairwell before a dinner
          party, in order to get his mother's attention, the boy  died
      soon after due to complications related to his fractured hip. Before his
      death from a blood clot in the hospital, Irene cared for him - remembering
          when she truly bonded with and protected her son when they hid together
          during WWII's blitzkrieg bombings. Her boy's catastrophic death caused
          her to become depressed, and to realize that her shallow, self-absorbed
          socialite life (a bourgeois worldly existence) needed to change and
          she must embrace all those in need with love (&quot;We have to change
          our lives!&quot;). With the urgings of her socialist-leftist journalist cousin Andrea
          Casatti (Ettore Giannini), Irene went on a humanitarian, metaphysical
          crusade to find redemption. She became dedicated
        to helping those who were less fortunate, ill, suffering unnecessarily
        and living in slums.  At first, she provided money to help a family
        with crippling medical bills for their young son. She also became a
        charitable do-gooder for dying, tubercular streetwalker Ines (Teresa
        Pellati), other exploited workers in soul-crushing assembly-line jobs,
        and an unmarried, impoverished single mother named Giulietta (Giulietta
        Masina) with six children in Passerotto. Due to her frequent absences,
        her affluent industrialist husband George Girard (Alexander Knox) jealously
          suspected that she was having an affair with Andrea, and also urged
          a doctor to declare her mentally-unbalanced. Her husband (and others)
          believed that she went too far when she aided a delinquent young thief
          (after a failed robbery and killing) to escape from the authorities,
          by freely letting him go (&quot;Turn
        yourself in. I know you'll do it&quot;). Irene's husband decided 
		to have her permanently institutionalized and
        committed to an asylum-sanitarium for abandoning her family life and
        friends. The film asked whether she should be condemned or not: Was she
        truly insane, or a patron-saint missionary (such as St. Francis) on an
        extreme, self-sacrificing quest?</font></p>      </td>

      Soldier, or Fan-Fan the Tulip)</b>, 102 minutes, D: Christian-Jaque<br />
      This charming, light-hearted and entertaining swashbuckling adventure film
      and romantic costume drama was set in mid-18th century France during King
      Louis XV's (Marcel Herrand) reign. The film's anti-war narrator (Hiram
      Sherman) began the crowd-pleasing film with the droll comment: &quot;His Majesty's
      soldiers found this war so pleasant that they made it last seven years.&quot; Young,
      devil-may-care, lazy Parisian peasant Fanfan la Tulipe (G&eacute;rard
          Philipe) was forced to evade a forced marriage
          to Marion (Ir&egrave;ne Young) - the pretty daughter of an outraged
          provincial farmer, after being caught sleeping with her on a
          haystack. On his forced march to the altar, the  roguish and witty
          young seductive womanizer was convinced to join the military after
          voluptuous gypsy girl Adeline (Gina Lollobrigida in a star-making role)
          caught his eye with a low-cut peasant outfit. She facetiously told
          him during a fortune-telling palm reading that he would fulfill his
          fateful destiny and achieve fame in the military and possibly take
          the king's daughter Princess Henriette (Sylvie Pelayo) as his wife
          in a royal wedding (&quot;You'll find glory in France's best regiment...The
          king's daughter loves you....And you'll marry her&quot;). Adeline successfully
          duped Fanfan and he was recruited to serve in the French army in the
          midst of the Seven Years' War. He then learned that Adeline La Franchise was a phony charlatan who had
          tricked him - she was the daughter of his recruiting Sergeant officer
          - Captain of the Guard La Franchise (Nerio Bernardi), and had faked
          her prophesy to enlist the gullible Fanfan into the depleted ranks,
          for a recruiting bonus. However, Fanfan still believed in Adeline's
          prophesy: (&quot;She predicted what I already knew...My destiny will be
          as you foretold and as I decided. I'll marry the king's daughter, when
          it suits me&quot;). While Fanfan was on his way to basic training, the sword-wielding,
          boyish recruit came to the rescue of the caravan
          of Princess Henriette, being escorted by La Marquise
          de Pompadour (Genevi&egrave;ve Page), when they were attacked by highwayman
          bandits. She gratefully kissed him for saving
          him from the brigands, and the Marquise rewarded Fanfan with a bejeweled
          tulip (to provide him with his emblematic floral nickname), to provide
          him with good luck: &quot;Take this tulip in memory of me and may it bring
          you luck.&quot; Fanfan deserted from the military, and forced his way into the King's
          palace to meet the Princess. He was captured, imprisoned, and sentenced
          to death for desertion, trespassing, forcible entry and disturbing
          the peace, but then pardoned and released (for having rescued Henriette
          earlier: &quot;He once risked his life to rescue Henriette and myself. It's
          our turn to return the good deed&quot;). Entering into a love triangle,
          Fanfan found he was falling in love with Adeline, who also loved him.
          Resistant and unwilling, Adeline had been approached 
          by the smarmy King Louis XV: (&quot;Adeline's charms
          caught the king's eye&quot;). She slapped the King and wouldn't yield
          to his unwelcome advances - and she was forced to flee to a convent
          and go into hiding. Meanwhile, Fanfan also found himself the object
          of the King's jealous anger, and during his attempted rescue of Adeline,
          he defeated the enemy and captured its supreme commander (&quot;We won without
          firing a single shot&quot;). He was handsomely rewarded by the grateful
           King with marriage to Adeline - thus fulfilling
      her earlier predicted prophesy: (&quot;You expressed the desire to wed your
          King's daughter, as predicted. You weren't deceived. I offer you my
          daughter's hand. It is my pleasure to lend a hand to providence. I
          give you my adopted daughter, Adeline La Franchise. She is worthy of
          you. She bravely held off all assaults on her beauty&quot;).</font></p>        </td>

            <font size="2">Michael Wilson's completed screenplay, thoroughly
                revised (uncredited) by the film's newly-appointed director Joseph
                L. Mankiewicz, was based upon L.C. Moyzisch's novel <i>Operation
                Cicero</i>. The fictionalized book (and subsequent semi-documentary
                spy-thriller film) was an account of how German Nazi intelligence
                officers during WWII were sold copies of the Allies' top secret
                documents (including information about the Normandy beach invasion
                of 1944, code-named Operation Overlord), in a transfer known
                as 'Operation Cicero.' The real-life 'Cicero' of the plot was
                Ulysses Diello ('Cicero') (James Mason), the traitorous valet
                to the British ambassador to Turkey in the early 1940s. As a
                spy, he plotted with intermediary Moyzisch (Oscar Karlweis) - the Nazi attache in the
        German embassy in Turkey, and Count Franz Von Papen
        (John Wengraf), the cynical German ambassador in Ankara, to  provide
          film rolls (photos of the secret war files) in return for weekly
        cash payments of British pounds. Diello had fallen in love with the beautiful
         Countess Anna Staviska (Danielle Darrieux), a destitute widowed Frenchwoman
        living in exile in Turkey, and used her new villa (financed by his payoffs)
        as a meeting point for his mysterious 'business' transactions. The British
        became suspicious of security leaks in the Turkish embassy and sent special
        agent George Travers (Michael Rennie) to investigate. In the film's ironic
        ending, after the Germans had bungled using the secret information, Diello
        was living a life of gentlemanly luxury in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, after
        being double-crossed by both the Countess (who fled to Switzerland after
        withdrawing money from her bank account) and the Germans (who it was
        revealed had paid Diello with counterfeit bills). </font></p>      </td>

      102 minutes, D: Rene Clement<br />
      Director Rene Clement's first feature film was a French war drama  based
      upon scriptwriter Fran&ccedil;ois
      Boyer's 1947 novel (with the title <i>The Secret Game</i>). This childhood
      anti-war film, an uncompromising, harsh neo-realist tale of lost innocence
      and the horrors of war, was the winner of an Honorary Oscar Award for Best
      Foreign Language film of its year. [Note: It was similar to other 'children
      in war' films, such as  <i>The Tin Drum (1979), Empire of the Sun (1987),
      Grave of the Fireflies (1988), Ponette (1996), </i>and<i> Life is Beautiful
      (1997)</i>.] During the Battle of France in June of
      1940 when Hitler's forces of Nazi Germany were invading France, the refugee
      parents of precocious 5 year-old Paulette (Brigitte Fossey) were strafed
      and killed during a German Army's air bombardment (with planes emblazoned
            with the Nazi Iron Cross) as they fled with other masses of people
            southward from the despoiled city of Paris and from other areas in
            Northern France. Traumatized but mute, and with her dead black and
            white puppy from a broken neck in her arms, she was reluctantly taken
            in by the Doll&eacute;  peasant farm family (Mr. Joseph Doll&eacute; (Lucien
          Hubert) with his wife Madame  Doll&eacute; (Suzanne Courtal)). The
          Catholic parents had three sons: the eldest deathly-ill son Georges
          (Jacques Marin) (after being kicked and dragged by a mad horse), Raymond
          (Pierre M&eacute;rov&eacute;e), the youngest - 11 year-old son Michel
          Doll&eacute; (Georges Poujouly),
          and two daughters:  teenaged Berthe Doll&eacute; (Laurence Badie) and
          14 year-old Ren&eacute;e (Violette Monnier). Soon, Paulette and Michel
          became playmates in a sort of 'puppy love,' and the mesmerized Michel
          eagerly sought to gratify Paulette's wishes to impress her. The two,
          led by the angelic yet morbid Paulette, tried to make sense of the
          surrounding death and destruction in the war by retreating into fantasy.
          They secretly built a small dead creatures cemetery (with identifying
          labels, and makeshift crucifixes or crosses for each grave constructed
          with wood, nails and a hammer) amongst the ruins of an abandoned watermill
          - their own private sanctuary to create beauty and peace. Due to Paulette's
          atheistic family upbringing (was she Jewish?), Michel had to explain
           to her the meaning of a cross in religious practice. Together, they
          buried her deceased and beloved puppy Jock and other dead animals and
          insects to keep him company (including a mole, cricket, cockroach,
          butterfly, bird, worm, etc.). One of their &quot;forbidden games&quot; was
          to steal crosses to mark the graves; as a partner in crime with Paulette,
          Michel stole crucifixes from a hearse and from a graveyard (including
          from the grave of his recently-deceased brother Georges), and at one
          point, Michel failed in burglarizing a cross from the village church's
          altar. Michel's father Joseph suspected that the crosses, stolen in
          acts of sacrilege, were being vandalized by his next-door neighbor
          and widower Mr. Gouard (Andr&eacute; Wasley) with whom he engaged
		   in a long-standing feud. [Note: The remainder
          of the Gouard family included two daughters: Marcelle (Fernande Roy)
          and Jeanne (Denise P&eacute;ronne), and a son in the  army named
          Francis Gouard (Philippe de Ch&eacute;risey, known as Am&eacute;d&eacute;e),
          who possibly deserted and returned home after the French defeat.] One
          of the other &quot;forbidden&quot; secrets in the film was the fact
          that Michel's sister Berthe was having an affair with Francis. Eventually,
          the father discovered that Michel was the one who had robbed the graveyard
          of its  crosses. Meanwhile, two French gendarmes (Andr&eacute; Enard
          and Bernard Musson) visited the Doll&eacute; household farm 
          in order to take Paulette away, and place her  in an orphanage
          for legal adoption. Michel promised his father that he would reveal
          the location of the stolen crosses to the authorities if Paulette was
          not released to the police. However, Michel was betrayed when his father
          didn't honor his promise, and in revenge, he ran away to destroy
          all of the crosses by throwing them in a river. Paulette was sent to
          a Red Cross refugee camp center. In the film's ending, the confused
          Paulette fled through the camp amidst crowds of people - she was crying
        and searching for Michel and then for her mother. </font></p>        </td>

            D'or)</b>,
          103 minutes, D: Jean Renoir<br />
      In director Jean Renoir's Technicolored, light-hearted, historical romantic
      costume-drama farce, its deeper theme was about the choice between art
      and worldly love. It was the first of a trilogy (followed by <i>French
      Cancan (1955)</i>, and <i>Elena And Her Men (1956)</i>). The
      film's setting was in the conquered, colonial country of Peru in the late
      18th century, in a South American town. The film's staging as a &quot;play-within-a-play&quot; was
      signified by an opening curtain. The
      central character was Camilla (Anna Magnani in her English-language debut),
      performing in a rag-tag touring Italian theatre company (<i>commedia
                  dell'arte</i>)  as its star. She was a boisterous, earthy,
                  vulgar, voluptuous and passionate  
               member of the  troupe,
                  headed by its director and leader, Don Antonio (Odoardo Spadaro)
                  (who took the stock character role of Pantalone). Camilla faced
                  a difficult choice of love among three competing suitors (male
                  archetypes), who were willing to offer her riches or duel for
                  her attention: (1) Ferdinand (Duncan Lamont), an arrogant,
                  refined and powerful royal Spanish diplomat - a Viceroy, (2)
                  Ramon (Riccardo Rioli), the area's famous hot-headed, manly
                  and vain Toreador (bullfighter), and (3) Felipe (Paul Campbell),
                  her ex-boyfriend suitor (from Italy) - a handsome, humble,
                  yet brave young Spanish Castilian officer-soldier serving in
                  the army. [Note: The competition for Camilla's
		love was mirrored in the troupe's <i>commedia del'arte</i> play performance,
		with Camilla (in the role of Columbina) pursued by - amongst others:
		Arlequin (Dante), Polichinelle (Alfredo Medini), and Florindo (Alfredo
		Kolner).] The love-struck Viceroy received a luxurious, gilded &quot;golden
              coach&quot; imported (from Europe) that was described by his mistress,
              the Marquise Irene Altamirano (Gisella Mathews) as: &quot;Beautiful!
        Exquisite! Breathtaking! It glitters so I can hardly look at it.&quot; 
		Instead of giving the coach to the Marquise, however,
              the Viceroy extravagantly and amorously considered offering it
        to Camilla as a love token. He was opposed by the town's ministers and
              nobles, and by the Marquise herself, causing him to back down and
        reconsider but then, he defied the nobility even though he knew that
              he might be deposed by the Bishop of Lima (Jean Debucourt). He
         decided to risk his Viceroy-ship by going through with his original
        audacious offer. Meanwhile, Camilla's other two suitors were arrested
        for dueling over her attentive affection. After receiving the coach and
		to avoid further conflict, Camilla turned it over to the Bishop of Lima,
        who announced that he would use the coach to transport the sacraments
        to sick and dying peasants. Camilla expressed difficulty
        in making a commitment to anyone - between worldly real-life suitors
        and the illusionary world of the theatre and its audiences. In the film's
        ending, she meditatively mused: &quot;Where is truth? Where does the theatre end and life begin?&quot; 
		During the concluding sequence -- Camilla was on the stage after all
		three suitors had departed and peace had been established. She was advised
		by Don Antonio who was standing on the side of the stage. He told her
		that should could realize her true self only on stage: &quot;Don't waste your
		time in the so-called real life. You belong to us, the actors, acrobats,
		mimes, clowns, mountebanks. Your only way to find happiness is on any
		stage, any platform, any public place, during those two little hours
		when you become another person - your true self.&quot; When the curtain fell
		behind Camilla, she was left alone on the solitary stage. She asked herself: &quot;Felipe,
		Ramon, the Viceroy disappeared, gone. Don't they exist anymore?&quot;  Don
            Antonio answered: &quot;Disappeared. Now they are a part of the audience.
            Do you miss them?&quot;  After a few moments of thought, Camilla
            sentimentally admitted that she didn't miss them very much: &quot;A
            little.&quot; Unregretful, she had made an enlightened choice to
            determine her own fate - and to follow and find her true self through
            the craft of acting on-stage and through the characters she would
      incarnate. </font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Greatest Show on Earth (1952),</b> 153 minutes,
      D: Cecil B. DeMille<br />
      Producer/director Cecil B. DeMille's undeserving, overwrought, splashy,
      star-filled Technicolored, Best Picture winning epic was actually a quasi-documentary
      and soapy showbiz melodrama about life (involving love, jealousy, and competing
      one-upmanship and rivalry amongst the circus folk) behind the scenes of
      the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus - with three interwoven
      plot lines. The film's opening included voice-over narration (by director
              DeMille)  about the spectacular pageantry of the &quot;Greatest
              Show on Earth&quot; - described as a &quot;massive machine&quot; involving
      1,400 employees. To save the circus financially and preserve hundreds
            of jobs, the hard-working and earnest circus manager and ringmaster
            Brad Braden (Charlton Heston) was forced by the show's stingy board
            of directors to hire world-class trapeze artist The Great Sebastian
            (Cornel Wilde), known as &quot;the Debonair King of the Air.&quot;
            The dashing, conceited foreign circus performer made a dramatic entrance
        in a speeding sports car with a police escort (and sirens blaring). During
        the film's story, makeup-wearing Buttons the Clown (James Stewart) was
        slowly revealed to be hiding a dark secret about his past life as a medical
        doctor who had 'mercy-killed' his wife and was a wanted man. The mysterious
        character gave early hints to his secret past, and also demonstrated
          unusual skill in bandage wrapping that he claimed he had learned
          as  &quot;a pharmacist's mate.&quot; A competitive romantic triangle
          with discord soon developed between Holly, her unaffectionate and distracted
          boyfriend Brad, and the womanizing, roguish ladies' man Sebastian.
          With the arrival of the world-class trapeze performer, Holly was ousted
        from being the star attraction in the center ring. During high-stakes
      competition between the aerialists in a dramatic scene, Sebastian (who
          had removed his safety net) experienced a high-flying fall during his
          circus act. Although seriously injured, he asked Braden for a favor:
          (&quot;Walk me off. Do not rob me of my
          exit&quot;). Subsequently,
      Holly returned as the star of the center ring (and she became Sebastian's
          love interest when she blamed herself for the tragic incident). The
      conflict within an on-going love triangle was also displayed when elephant
          girl red-head Angel (Gloria Grahame) fell for Braden, causing jealousy
          in her boss-trainer boyfriend Klaus (Lyle Bettger). During the show,
          he threatened to command a jumbo elephant to smash her face with
          its giant foot. He was subsequently fired by Braden from the show.
          The film's catastrophic highlight was the scene of a spectacular circus
          train wreck, sending train cars off the tracks, and releasing wild
          animals from their smashed cages. Buttons was compelled to reveal his
          secret past in order to perform a life-saving blood transfusion between
          Sebastian and the critically-injured Brad who was profusely bleeding
          from a ruptured artery. Buttons was arrested by Special FBI Agent Gregory
          (Henry Wilcoxon) who had been on his trail for awhile, for killing
          his terminally-ill wife. In the triumphant and exciting ending after
          the loss of property in the train wreck, a circus
            parade was led by Holly; she had taken charge and had promoted the
            improvised, open-air circus (without a tent) for the town with a
        massive parade down the main street to the circus grounds. </font></p>

            minutes, D: Fred Zinnemann<br />
            Fred Zinnemann's classic and tense black and white revisionist
            Western (shot virtually in 'real-time') has  frequently been interpreted
            as a parable (or allegorical tale) about artists left to &quot;stand
            alone&quot; and face persecution and accusations of being Communist
            during the HUAC Hollywood blacklisting of the McCarthy hearings in
            the early 1950s. The legendary western  provided
            a masterful portrayal of a deserted, newly-married and retiring Marshal
            Will Kane (Oscar-winning Gary Cooper) left alone in the western town
            of Hadleyville (in the New Mexico Territory) in the mid-1870s, pitted
            against three vengeful gunslingers led by gang-leader Frank Miller
            (Ian MacDonald). The principled lawman awaited a suspenseful, fateful
            showdown with ruthless bandits returning to the small town to seek
            revenge. The film was enhanced by Dimitri Tiomkin's title ballad &quot;Do
            Not Forsake Me, O My Darlin'&quot; (sung by Tex Ritter). The middle-aged
            Kane had just been married to pacifist Quaker bride Amy Fowler (Grace
            Kelly) at 10:35 am, when he learned that a
            mean outlaw (that Kane had sent to prison five years earlier) had
            just been pardoned by liberal abolitionists and released, and was
            arriving in town at noon on the train to meet up with his gang, including
            Miller's younger brother Ben Miller (Sheb Wooley), Jack Colby (Lee
            Van Cleef in his film debut), and James Pierce (Robert J. Wilke).
            Kane had left town with Amy for a new life in nearby Clarksburg,
            to raise a family, but a few miles out of town, Kane had second thoughts: &quot;It's
            no good. I've got to go back, Amy...They're making me run. I've never
            run from anybody before,&quot; and they rode back to town. Back in
            the Marshal's office in town, Amy begged her resolute new husband
            to reconsider: (&quot;Don't try to be a hero. You don't have to be
            a hero, not for me&quot;). Then, she defiantly handed him an ultimatum
            on her wedding day: if he wouldn't go away with her, she would go
            alone by train to St. Louis - on the one that departed at twelve
            noon.  Much of the film was composed of Kane's agonized wait for the noon train
            - with numerous, repetitive, large closeup views of clocks ticking
            in 'real time'; with integrity and a strong sense of justice, duty, and loyalty, he placed everything on
        the line. Judge Percy Mettrick (Otto Kruger) who had sentenced
              Miller and officiated at Kane's marriage, was found packing his
              bags to 'forsake' the community, and urged Kane to do the same.
            In the local church, Kane delivered a beleaguered plea as he sought
            to enlist deputies and gain support to help him defend the town against
            vengeful gunslingers about to arrive. One of the influential spokespersons
            in the church, the town's Senior Selectman and Mayor Jonas Henderson
            (Thomas Mitchell) concluded by advising
          Kane to flee town for the good of the local economy. Kane left the
            church empty-handed, and then visited the house of aging,
          discarded, arthritic, and embittered ex-marshal Matt Howe (Lon Chaney,
          Jr.), Kane's predecessor, who offered his cynical opinion to Kane about
          his past profession as a life-long 'tin-star' lawman. Kane realized
            that he would be left single-handed to face the desperadoes.  Functioning
            as the ex-mistress of both Frank Miller and
            Kane, and as Harvey Pell's current girlfriend, the worldly-wise,
            half-Mexican saloon owner and businesswoman Helen Ram&iacute;rez
            (Katy Jurado) at the Ramirez Saloon had just negotiated to sell her
            saloon before quickly departing from town; in the hotel, she met
            Amy and advised her to not abandon her husband. In the town's livery
            stable, Kane engaged in a vicious fist-fight with his embittered,
            cowardly young ex-deputy Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges) who had earlier
            attempted to manipulatively blackmail him into succeeding him as
            the next Marshal in exchange for helping to defend the town. Anticipating
            his own death at a few minutes before twelve 'high noon,' Kane wrote
            his own last will and testament in his office; he heard the noon
            train's whistle from afar. A long, upward-moving crane shot  pulled
            back, revealing the Marshal's forsakenness amidst the storefronts
            and rooftops of the small community. In the exciting final shootout,
            Kane confronted the four desperadoes at noon who walked into town
            from the station. Early on, Kane shot and killed Ben Miller on the
            street and then from a barn's hayloft, he shot and killed Colby,
            but was wounded (shot in the left arm) when he fled from the burning
            barn. Unbeknownst to Kane, Amy (who was on her way back
          to town from the train station) came to her husband's aid. She gunblasted
             Pierce from behind through a broken window, but then, after being
            grabbed by Frank Miller as a hostage, Amy fought him off by clawing
            at his face and was pushed to the ground. With a clear shot, Kane
            killed Miller and then relieved that it was all over, he embraced
            Amy. In the film's conclusion after vanquishing the killers,
          Kane disavowed the ungrateful town by contemptuously
          throwing his star-shaped badge into the dirt at his feet, and then
          rode off in his packed buckboard wagon with Amy. The contemptible crowd
          that was unwilling to fight to preserve its law and order remained
          silent as the buckboard went out of view, accompanied by the first
          words of the title song 'High Noon's' famous melancholy ballad: (&quot;Do
          not forsake me, oh my darlin'...&quot;).</font></p>        </td>

      minutes, D: Akira Kurosawa<br />
      Akira Kurosawa's humanistic, existential, and poignant drama (the title
      meant: &quot;To Live&quot;) told about a terminally-ill man  who went searching
      for life's purpose and meaning. The film was divided into two distinct
      parts: the first was about the male protagonist's wasted life, and the
      second was a series of non-chronological flashbacks and memories at the
      protagonist's funeral-wake service. The unemotional, rather dull,
              longtime, low-level petty bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura)
      was a widower with an estranged and greedy son Mitsuo (Nobuo Kaneko) that
      he had raised. For at least three decades, Kanji had worked as
              a disagreeable and spirit-lacking Tokyo City Hall office chief
              and civil servant (in the position of Public Affairs Section Chief)
      in the same monotonous, rubber-stamping job. Kanji Watanabe learned of
      his imminent death (forecast within a year) due to stomach-gastric cancer
      (seen in the opening shot of his X-Ray). Devastated by the unexpected news
      (although the doctor, to lighten the blow, gave him a modified and less
      serious diagnosis of an ulcer), he reacted in a depressed, head-down position
              as he left the hospital, where he was nearly
      killed by a truck with a blaring horn. Upon his return home, he accidentally
      eavesdropped on a conversation between his son and daughter-in-law Kazue
      (Kyoko Seki) who spoke of their impatience with acquiring Kanji's pension
              and inheritance in order to purchase a home of their own - it was
      another despairing blow to his life. The news of the probable, impending
      end of his life caused Watanabe to reevaluate what his life had meant in
      his few remaining months. He began a search for meaning, first calling
      in sick to work, while 'enjoying life' by drinking and frequenting hooch,
      striptease and pachinko gambling parlors and other dark locales of the
      underworld of Tokyo nightlife. On his nocturnal journey, he was guided
      by a dead-beat, eccentric, black-clad writer-novelist whom he met in a
      bar - self-described as Mephistopheles (Yunosuke Ito). In
      a Tokyo 'red-light district' nightclub, the despairing and drunken Watanabe
       symbolically sang &quot;Gondola no Uta&quot; - a 1915 dirge song with
       lyrics about the fleeting nature of youth, missed opportunities, and the
       rapid aging process. He also  briefly became close friends with cheerful
       and exuberant younger employee Toyo Odagiri (Miki Odagiri), the only female
       staffer in his office. She had just resigned from her life-sapping job,
       and inspired him to make a mark with his own life. She also urged him
      to quit his job as she had. Eventually,
              she explained to him how she had found fulfillment in the fast-paced
              industrial society via her new job -  making toy rabbits for
      Japanese children. Kanji  was inspired to make an
      uncharacteristically generous, worthwhile and socially-motivated decision
      to support the Kuroe Women's Asssociation's city project to transform a
      garbage dump-sewer area in the slum district into a playground and park
      for children - it would be his final triumph to support and promote the
      project that had been stalled and diverted due to the bureaucracy, and
      the counter-efforts of the local yakuza to turn the area into another profitable
      'red-light' district.  In the second instance of singing the dirge
              song (on the night of his death, 5 months after his diagnosis),
              Watanabe was joyfully rocking slowly back and forth on a swing
              in his newly-constructed park during a light snowfall (it also
      served as flashback to a policeman finding his body). In the second part
      of the film after Watanabe's death, there were varying reactions and cynical,
      judgmental and gossipy comments from his shallow bureaucratic co-workers
      (who were freely drinking sake at the wake) about his passionate, socially-productive
              act, with some exhibiting contempt, conjecture, inspiration, credit-claiming,
              jealousy, suspicion, confusion, and frustration over the park project.
      However, the grieving Kuroe Women's Society gratefully attended the funeral
      to pay their respects. At the wake, Kimura (Shinichi
              Himori), the only civil servant in Kanji's office who seemed truly
              inspired by his 
            example, was afterwards quickly stifled and sternly repressed
            at the office for acting out of place and wanting to support another
              oppressed group seeking help. In the film's
              final ambiguous frames, it was unclear whether Kimura's newfound
      convictions would be realized. </font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Pat and Mike (1952)</b>, 95 minutes, D: George Cukor</font><br />
            <font size="2">Director George Cukor's sports-related romantic comedy,
             about an apparently mis-matched and unlikely couple who would
            beat the odds and become a romantic partnership,
            was the 7th of 9 films (from 1942-1967) featuring Spencer Tracy and
            Katharine Hepburn. The opening sequence introduced widowed, independent
            and smart, outdoorsy college phys-ed instructor and Pacific Technical
            College coach Pat Pemberton (Katharine Hepburn) during a foursome
            golf game. She had been partnered with Mr. Beminger (Loring Smith)
            who was being groomed to be a college donor, while matronly Mrs.
            Beminger (Phyllis Povah) was playing with Pat's overbearing,
                pompous and demanding fianc&eacute;e Collier Weld (William Ching)
                - a college administrator. Pat was encouraged to play her best
                and win with her partner. Whenever in the presence
              of a very reproachful, highly-critical Collier, however, Pat  would
                become overly nervous and develop an inferiority complex. During
                the game on the golf course, she played poorly and was criticized
                for her lack of coordination. She was advised to tense up her
                gluteal muscles in order to help her golf-stance by a screechy
                Mrs. Beminger. Following a condescending barrage of golf tips,
                Pat responded by twice pushing her into a chair before hitting
                nine teed-up golf balls in a row to impress her. She struck nine
                golf balls with perfect drives and then told off Mrs. Beminger.
                Pat was invited to play in the Women's National amateur championship
                (one of her opponents was famed female golf player Babe Didrikson
                Zaharias). One of the attendees who marveled at Pat's play -
                and was pursuing her as one of his potential clients, was unscrupulous,
                rough-hewn, seedy sports promoter Mike Conovan (Spencer Tracy),
                who suggested that he could become her manager. Pat lost the
                tournament on the last putt due to Collier's presence, and then
                thought she might reconsider Mike's offer to manage her (he was
                also willing to promote her other sports skills - as a tennis
                player and target shooter); she met with Mike in his New York
                office, and signed a contract with him to represent her. As her
                confident manager, he took over her rigid training schedule and
                imposed various rules - no liquor, cigarettes, late hours or
                interaction with Collier (who always compelled her to lose).
                During a tennis tournament in San Francisco at the Cow Palace,
                Pat was excelling as the headliner until one afternoon, Collier
                attended. Pat suddenly broke down as she delusionally imagined the tennis net getting
                higher, while her racket was shrinking in size. She fainted on
                the court in the middle of her match. After overcoming
                many hurdles in their relationship (including her persistent
                fianc&eacute;e, crooked racketeering gamblers
                who attempted to beat up Mike and pressured Pat to throw a golf tournament,
                and a jealous, dim-witted boxer named Davie Hucko (Aldo Ray)),
                Pat became a well-known, nationwide sports celebrity. Their concluding
                decision was to work together. Pat suggested that Mike take care
                of her, and that they could team up romantically. He responded
                affirmatively: &quot;I don't know if I can lick you, or
            you can lick me, but I'll tell ya one thing I do know. Together,
            we can lick 'em all.&quot; They shook hands on a partnership (and
            agreed to get married), and he was there for her when she won a major
      golfing tournament event on her last putt. </font></p></td>

            minutes, D: John Ford<br />
        John Ford's Irish romantic comedy/drama was a <em>Taming
        of the Shrew</em> tale - lushly filmed on location. It told about
        an American ex-prizefighter Sean Thornton (John Wayne) who retired to
        his native, childhood Ireland (the greenish town of Inisfree) to begin
        a new life and escape from his past. He was escorted and aided by the
        impish, leprechaun-like matchmaker and carriage taxi-driver Michaeleen
        Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald). Sean was introduced to the local Irish priest
        Father Lonergan (Ward Bond), and was shown his mother's former cottage,
        his ancestral Thornton home, as well as the local pub. After eyeing a
        beautiful Irish lass -  the fiery, red-haired, strong-willed Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara),
        a poor shepherd girl, he asked himself: &quot;Hey, is that real? She
        couldn't be.&quot; Sean was  cautioned about having a romantic interest
        in her, but he was determined to court her. He found himself at odds
        with Mary Kate's rough, bullying, grudge-holding and disapproving
        older brother Will 'Red' Danaher (Victor McLaglen), who was also competing
        with him to purchase the home from  the town's well-respected, wealthy 
		widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick). The formal
        rules of courtship in the land dictated that drunken matchmaker Michaeleen
        Flynn had to formally present Sean Thornton's proposal of marriage to
        Mary Kate. Sean did not care about her lack of fortune or poverty, but
        she was fiercely adamant about  refusing to give up her possessions (her
        dowry and other precious heirlooms). When Will Danaher was asked to 
        consent and approve Mary Kate's courtship and marital
        intentions, because their father was deceased - he flatly refused. A
        conspiratorial plot was therefore devised by townsfolk including Michaeleen,
        Reverend Playfair (Arthur Shields), and the parish priest Father Lonergan.
        They spread the rumor that Will could quickly marry the widow Tillane
        if he let Mary Kate marry Sean. Soon after, Will gave his consent to
        Sean's and Mary Kate's courtship, and they were married. After the formal
        ceremony, Will Danaher then took the floor to announce his romantic intentions
        for widow Sarah Tillane, but learned that he had been fooled. He reneged
        on Mary Kate's promised dowry of 350 Irish pounds and precious heirlooms.
        Further major conflict developed between the couple when Mary Kate falsely
        perceived that Sean wouldn't fight for her dowry and possessions. When
        Sean was punched and downed by Will, he experienced a disquieting and
        troubling flashback of his guilty secret - a memory of his last prize
        fight back in the US, where he was known as &quot;Trooper Thorn&quot;
          when he killed his opponent in the ring (in his flashback, his dead
          opponent appeared to be Will Danaher). Sean refused to fight back,
        thus appearing weak to Mary Kate. On their wedding night, she told him
          that she would not consummate her love for him until she had her dowry,
          and she rejected his romantic advances. Although Mary Kate's furniture
          and possessions were delivered to the house, the dowry was still missing
          and Mary Kate demanded that Sean demand
          her money from her brother. When the ashamed Mary Kate decided to leave
          town for Dublin by traveling to the Castletown train station when Sean
          wouldn't fight for her, Sean pursued her, caught up to her, dragged
          her out of a train car, and continued to pull her five miles across
          the fields back to the Danaher farm - with a crowd of spectators following
          behind them. Sean successfully delivered an ultimatum to Will Danaher
          and obtained Mary Kate's 350 pounds. However, Sean didn't really care
          about the money and proceeded to burn it in the furnace of a threshing
          machine - Danaher stepped forward to protest the money's destruction
          - and thus commenced a lengthy, epic marathon, brawl/fist-fight scene
          in the Irish town - all the way from the Danaher farm to the village,
          interrupted by bouts of drinking. Afterwards, Will was even invited
          into Sean's house for supper prepared by Mary Kate. In the film's tranquil
          and satisfying conclusion,  Will
          Danaher and the Widow Tillane were courting each other, and Mary Kate
          whispered a sexy secret in Sean's ear while beckoning him to join her
          in the cottage. </font></p>      </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Rancho Notorious (1952)</b>, 89 minutes, D: Fritz Lang<br />
        Director Fritz Lang's   third (and last) western (after <i>The Return
        of Frank James (1940)</i> and <i>Western Union (1941)</i>) was a quirky,
        noirish, dream-like, Technicolored frontier revenge western for RKO Pictures,
            with a distinctive, stylized (set-bound) story with perverse Freudian
            overtones. The film's opening thematic ballad
            and recurring song during the opening credits was &quot;Legend of
            Chuck-a-Luck&quot; - emphasizing the refrain of &quot;Hate, Murder, and Revenge&quot; -
        the deadly forces of fate, the uselessness of revenge, and murder. [Note:
        Chuck-a-Luck referred to a roulette-style gambling game, both a gambler's
        vertical wheel and the Wheel of Fate.] In the first
        sequence, in the town of Whitmore, WY in the Assayer's Office (part of
        the General Store), cattle ranch-hand Vern Haskell (Arthur Kennedy) and
        his sweetheart Beth Forbes (Gloria Henry) - who worked in her father's
        store, were to be married in 8 days. Before Vern left, he presented
        his fiancee with a beautiful, jewel-studded brooch (&quot;Came from Paris
        in France&quot;). Shortly later, Beth was shockingly raped and murdered
            (off-screen) by one of the two riders (deadly outlaw Kinch
            (Lloyd Gough)), after Beth was forced to open the Assayer's office
            safe to bags of money. Vern went on a vengeful pursuit of the two
        culprits with a sheriff's posse and then proceeded on his own. He found
              a mortally-wounded Whitey (John Doucette), the long, white-haired
              partner of the murderer, who had been shot in the back after a
              quarrel over the stolen money by his double-crossing partner Kinch.
              As Whitey died, he was given a clue to Kinch's destination - Chuck-a-Luck,
              the name of a casino game. During Vern's long and relentless search
              for Beth's surviving outlaw killer, he finally realized that the
              clue referred to a hideout managed or run by notorious, aging dance-hall
              girl Altar Keane (Marlene Dietrich). He also learned that Keane
              was associated with  infamous and handsome gunslinger-sharpshooter
               Frenchy Fairmont (Mel Ferrer), who had helped her win big at the
              'Chuck-a-Luck' roulette wheel. To learn more about Altar from Frenchy,
              Vern deliberately had himself jailed on election day (by shooting
              up a saloon to get a prohibited drink) in order to befriend Frenchy
              who was incarcerated in the town of Gunsight. Afterwards, he helped
              to orchestrate their escape and the two proceeded to a secluded
              horse ranch near the Mexican border, a safe haven for outlaws -
              it was named 'Chuck-a-Luck.' She harbored thieves, cattle
          rustlers and killers in exchange for 10% of the proceeds of their crimes.
              After a love triangle of sorts developed between Frenchy, Keane,
              and Vern,   on the night of her birthday celebration, Vern noticed
              Keane was wearing the jewel-studded brooch (on her fancy gown)
              that he had given to Beth moments before her death. Presumably,
              someone at the ranch was Beth's killer. From then on, Vern attempted
              to ingratiate himself to Keane and romance her, to betray her knowledge
              of the killer (against the code of the ranch which required &quot;no
              questions asked&quot;). She finally divulged that Kinch was the hideout's
            murderer: &quot;Kinch gave it to me&quot; - and Vern became filled with
            anger. In a bar, he confronted Kinch  and challenged him to a gunfight
            stand-off, but Kinch wouldn't draw his gun. The killed was saved
            when Vern was jailed by the local sheriff. After a jailbreak,
            a climactic showdown followed at 'Chuck-a-Luck' between Frenchy and
            Keane (joined by Vern) against Kinch and all the other outlaws including
            Wilson (George Reeves). The outlaws had ganged
            up when they feared that Keane was going to betray all of them. 
            In the concluding gunfight, Kinch was killed (by Frenchy), Wilson
            was shot dead (by Vern), and Keane was mortally wounded when she
            shielded Frenchy and took a bullet for him in the chest. She died
            on her bed between Vern and Frenchy. Now alone, Frenchy rode off
            with Vern.</font></p>      </td>

            minutes, D: Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen<br />
            Gene Kelly's, Stanley Donen's and MGM's classic film musical was
             a perfect example of an organic, 'integrated musical' in which the
            story's characters naturally expressed their emotions in the midst
            of their lives, with song and dance replacing the dialogue. It was
            one of the all-time best and most enjoyable of Hollywood musicals,
            produced by the Freed Unit. Tthis colorful and appealing film spoofed
            and satirized the transitional chaos surrounding the end of the silent
            film era and the dawn of the 'talkies.' During the opening credits,
            the three stars danced in bold yellow raincoats and sang the title
            song &quot;Singin' in the Rain.&quot; In the film's opening, vaudeville,
            egocentric silent film actor/dancer Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and
            his vain, empty-headed, shrill, nasal boiced, blonde co-star actress
            Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) were attending their Monumental Pictures'
            1927 film premiere held at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.
             The film was their latest romantic, black and white swashbuckler, <i>The
            Royal Rascal. </i>Both were at the height of their box-office popularity.
            On his way to a post-preview party after leaving the theatre's film
            premiere, Don met pretty young ingenue Kathy Selden (a pert 19 year
            old Debbie Reynolds in her first major role), a young, bouncy, flapper
            - an aspiring, fresh-faced and enthusiastic actress. At a post-preview
            party held at studio boss R.F. Simpson's (Millard Mitchell) home
            to celebrate the premiere, he announced that the studio didn't have
            to worry about competing with the advent of sound heralded by Warners'
            full-length sound picture <i>The Jazz Singer (1927). </i> Simpson
            soon changed his mind after the success of Warners' talking picture
            a few weeks later; his stars were pressured to change their next
            silent romantic drama (<i>The Duelling Cavalier</i>) and
            make it their first sound picture. Don's wise-cracking pal Cosmo
            (Donald O'Connor) attempted to cheer Don up, because he was an actor
            and 'the show must go on.' Cosmo performed a wacky but memorable
            sequence - an amusing, acrobatic, highly energetic <i>tour-de-force</i> number,
            entitled &quot;Make 'Em Laugh.&quot; In the studio, silent film hero
            Don was delighted and thrilled to see Kathy again, and made his peace
            with her, but he was tongue-tied with words, so he sang and danced
            a fabulous love duet with her on an empty sound stage:
              &quot;You Were Meant for Me,&quot; in which he declared his love
              to her. In scenes of comic exaggeration, making fun of
          the problems Hollywood faced with the coming of sound, Don
          and Lina were both ordered to take diction lessons from an elocution
          coach, memoralized by the song &quot;Moses Supposes&quot; between Don
          and Cosmo. The filming of the <i>sound</i> version
          of the film <i>The Duelling Cavalier </i> was one of the high points
          of the film; the problems of placing hidden microphones on the set
          and filming with bulky cameras in the early talkies was comically illustrated;
          Lina made a disastrous attempt to speak into a concealed microphone.
          The revised film turned out laughable before studio preview audiences,
          due to unsynchronized and uneven sound, and Lina's ghastly ungenteel
          voice. Depressed by the preview, fellow conspirators Don,
              Cosmo and Kathy discussed their problems later that drizzly evening
          during an all-night talk session. It ended in
          the early morning with the marvelously upbeat production number &quot;Good
          Mornin'&quot; after Don had received helpful advice from his dance
          partner and friend Cosmo Brown and his ingenue girlfriend Kathy Selden.
          Their idea was to recruit Kathy to rescue and salvage the film - by
          secretly dubbing over Lina's uncouth voice (&quot;She can't act, she
          can't sing, and she can't dance, a triple threat...Use Kathy's voice.
          Lina just moves her mouth and Kathy's voice comes over singing and
          talking for her&quot;).
           The disastrous costume drama would become a musical swashbuckler titled <i>The
          Dancing Cavalier</i>. In a classic, unforgettable,
              heart-lifting, enchanting dance scene during a cloudburst in the
              middle of the night after taking Kathy home, Don performed a glorious
              and joyous, almost five minute rendition of the title song &quot;Singin'
              In the Rain&quot; - it was a spontaneous expression of his crazy-in-love,
              euphoric mood and love-struck happiness over his new-found love
              for Kathy. In the rain dance during a downpour, he passed by shop
              windows, splashed through puddles, and stood on a streetlamp -
              with his trusty umbrella; it ended with a policeman's quizzical
              look after Don tipped his hat. The next day,
              Don and Cosmo explained their saving idea to Hollywood studio head
              R. F. Simpson. <i>The Duelling Cavalier</i> was to be renamed <i>The
              Dancing Cavalier</i> and the plan was to include large-scale musical
              numbers within the film. Kathy's dubbed voice would be superimposed
              onto the soundtrack. During the film's production, Don also explained
          what the film needed to Simpson - he suggested
            a large, modern, dance  number that would be inserted into
          the sound film. It became the film's largest
          and lengthiest segment titled &quot;Broadway Melody Ballet.&quot; It
          was comprised of a show-business rags-to-riches story of a young hoofer's
          success on Broadway, featuring a seductive dance by
          a gangster's moll portrayed by guest dance artist Cyd Charisse; although
          Simpson agreed to the idea of making the film a musical, he wasn't
          so sure about Don's extravagant idea. The newly-envisioned sound film
          was a tremendous success, and Lina's career was saved, when Kathy had
          her voice substituted for all of Lina's lines and songs. However, the
            voice-dubbing deception was ultimately exposed during <i>The Dancing
            Cavalier</i>'s premiere (advertised as &quot;ALL SINGING, ALL TALKING,
            ALL DANCING&quot;), at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Lina was embarrassed
            in front of the audience and laughed off the stage at the film's
            premiere when she was unable to duplicate the film's singing style
            in a live performance and appearance onstage. Kathy was revealed
            to be the true singer behind her, substituting for Lina's voice.
            As the embarrassed Kathy fled up the theatre aisle, Don from the
            stage shouted &quot;Stop that girl&quot;, and then he told the audience: &quot;That's
            the girl whose voice you heard and loved tonight. She's the real
            star of the picture. Kathy Selden.&quot; Don started
            to sing to her: &quot;You Are My Lucky Star&quot; as she returned
            to the stage and they embraced. Afterwards, the two hugged
            in front of a billboard on a hillside announcing their new starring
              roles as the new stellar love team of Monumental Pictures, as
            romance blossomed between Kathy and Don. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><strong>Umberto D. (1952, It.)</strong>, 91 minutes,
            D: Vittorio De Sica<br />
            Director Vittorio De Sica's neo-realist, classic Italian New Wave
            was a sentimental and heartbreaking melodramatic tearjerker, and
            a poignant character study of a man tragically pushed to his limits.
            In the film's opening, elderly pensioners chanted and carried signs
            as they protested in the streets of central Rome, but were dispersed
            by the police for not having a permit. One of the protestors was
            destitute, elderly, retired government worker/pensioner Umberto Domenico
            Ferrari (Carlo Battisti) who faced financial ruin - he was a lonely
            senior citizen with no family or close ties, who had worked for 30
            years as a clerk for the Ministry of Public Affairs. In a local soup
            kitchen, Umberto snuck food to his faithful pet dog Flike from his
      plate. His meager monthly fixed-income pension was slashed,
              and his heartless, callous and tyrannical landlady Antonia Belloni
          (Lina Gennari) (with self-absorbed aspirations to be in show business)
              of ten years threatened to evict him at the end of the month from
              the boarding house, and rent out his room to prostitutes and other
      couples for quick sex. The only truly close friends and dependent relationships
              Umberto had were with  his faithful spotted terrier pet  Flike,
              and with teenaged, caring, and sympathetic 3-months
              pregnant house-maid Maria (Maria Pia Casilio). She was unsure if
              the father of her child in the Italian military was from   Florence
             or Naples.  In one 
            transcendent scene that followed her  early morning routine, Maria
                (who was facing a difficult future too, if the landlady found
                out she was pregnant) roused herself out of bed to perform her
                menail chores, including grinding coffee beans 
      in the kitchen. After a case of tonsillitis and a few days in the
            comfort of a Catholic-run charity infirmary, Umberto returned to
            his apartment building to find his room being destroyed during renovations. 
            Maria had taken care of Flike during his absence, but she confessed
            that Flike had disappeared through an open apartment door and had
            run off (had the landlady spitefully let the dog out?). Fortunately,
            Flike was located in the local pound and the two were overjoyed with
      being reunited. In the film's tearjerking, ambiguous ending, without
            any money and feeling distraught and defeated with nowhere to turn,
            the hopeless Umberto packed up his room and departed: (&quot;I have
            no one, no son or brother, to help me out. I'm just a good-for-nothing
            old man&quot;). After numerous failed attempts to give his dog away
            (rather than cruelly abandoning it), Umberto became desperate but
      still remained calm and logical. Homeless and penniless with no monetary
            sources (and hateful of turning into a shameless beggar or debtor),
            Umberto contemplated suicide by stepping in front of a speeding train near a park while
            holding Flike -- the frightened dog yelped, wriggled and squirmed
            away before Umberto could step in front of the train, and for the
      first time, ran away in abject fear from his beloved master. Umberto pursued
            after Flike, and coaxed the forgiving Flike
            back to him by having the dog perform tricks with a pine cone: (&quot;Flike,
            look at the pinecone. Come on, here, boy. Come on, stand up&quot;).
            He played with the dog (trained to stand on its hind legs) in a long
      shot as the film ended, despite having no place to stay and no income.</font></p></td>
