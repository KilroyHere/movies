              minutes, D: Walt Disney Animation Studios <br />
            This highly  appealing, popular Disney animated film classic was
                 based on Felix Salten's 1923 book. The legendary film followed
                newborn baby fawn Bambi as he grew up, experienced the loss of
                his mother by a hunter, and eventually became a leader of the
                herd - a magnificent stag known as The Great Prince of the Forest.
                The maturing of Bambi illustrated the struggles, turmoil, and
                changes that accompanied the changing of seasons, the passage
                of time, and life's survival, as he came of age and completed
                the cycle of life. The film opened with a beautifully-realized,
                highly-realistic opening birth scene (&quot;the
                new prince is born&quot;) of a young fawn named Bambi in 
				the depths and undergrowth of the forest.
                As Bambi grew up in coming-of-age scenes, he walked through the
                forest, and stumbled over his spindly legs and had trouble with
                his footing when taught how to walk/run by his cute, energetic
                and lovable rabbit friend Thumper. During
                Bambi's first winter, Thumper offered lessons for Bambi on how
                to slide across the ice - causing Bambi to end up spread-eagled.
                Other friends included bashful skunk Flower, Owl, and many other
                forest creatures, especially a female fawn named Faline. During
                Bambi's first visit to the meadow with his mother, he had a glimpse
                of his father - The Great Prince, who warned the other animals
                of the approach of Man - a hunter. In the most traumatic scene
                (with the sound of a gunshot off-screen), Bambi's mother was
                murdered by Man - a hunter in a snow-covered meadow. The
                small fawn who had escaped harm gave fearful cries of &quot;Mother,
                where are you?&quot; during a raging snowstorm. Bambi's buck
                father's delivered a  fateful message about
                her death to Bambi: (&quot;Your mother can't be with you anymore&quot;)
                - one of the saddest sequences in film history. As Bambi matured
                into a young stag, wise old Owl delivered a humorous sex-education
                speech on the power of falling in love (&quot;twitterpatted&quot;);
                at around that time, both Flower and Thumper found romantic counterparts.
                Bambi courted pretty young doe Faline, but was interrupted by
                a rival older buck deer named Ronno, and Bambi was forced to
                fight for Faline's affection, in  an expressionistically-filmed
                fight sequence. In another terrifying scene during the return
                and approach of hunters, Bambi protected Faline from a pack of
                mad and vicious hunting dogs unleashed by Man; although Bambi
                was wounded, he survived. The forest was destroyed by a chaotic
                and raging wildfire (carelessly caused by a campfire set by Man),
                and the animals were helplessly caught in the conflagration as
                they attempted to flee. In the final springtime scene, a grown
                Bambi (with the recent birth of twins with Faline) proudly took
                his place and stood with his 'Prince of the Forest' father, silhouetted
                against the sky, before he ascended to the top position in the
          herd when his father stepped aside (and presumably passed on).</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Michael Curtiz<br />
            Director Michael Curtiz'  best-loved film of all time, a perennial-favorite,
            was a must-see classic and Best Picture. [Note: The date given for
            the film was often either 1942 and 1943. That was because its limited
            premiere was in 1942, but the film did not play nationally, or in
            Los Angeles, until 1943.] The tale of intrigue, romance, love lost,
            heroism, and conscience, with  well-paced dialogue, a sentimental
            script, moody and atmospheric sets, and a first-rate cast of memorable
            characters, was set during World War II in Casablanca (North Africa)
            at a seedy Algerian saloon/nightclub run by cynical saloonkeeper
            Richard &quot;Rick&quot; Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), an American expatriate. The Cafe Americain was
            filled with European refugees, smugglers, thieves and Nazis. Into
            his joint walked now-married, long-lost-love Ilsa Lund Laszlo (Ingrid
            Bergman) and her underground Resistance freedom-fighter husband Victor
            Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who were trying to arrange their escape from
            the Nazis. They urged him to help support the French Resistance movement.
            Vivid memories of Rick's and the luminous Ilsa's passionate Paris
            love affair (just before the Germans occupied the city) ending in
            betrayal were shown in flashback. Ilsa asked Rick to help them escape
            to neutral Lisbon, because he had two &quot;letters of transit&quot; 
        - would he give the letters to them, or would she stay with Rick?</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Jacques Tourneur<br />
            Director Jacques Tourneur's classic, low-budget, suspenseful RKO
            fantasy-horror film was the first film produced by horror film master
            Val Lewton (and his biggest hit), with moody and sinister atmosphere,
            eerie sound effects, subtle understatement, interesting camera angles,
            and a judicious use of shock effects. It was followed by  the sequel
             <i>The Curse of the Cat People (1944)</i>, and director Paul Schrader's
            excessively-violent and erotic remake <i>Cat People (1982)</i> with
            Nastassja Kinski. A ship-building architect
            Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) quickly married a mysterious, kitten-faced
            young bride - a beautiful Balkan artist and fashion designer named
            Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon). He became worried when his obsessively
             'frigid' wife refused to consummate the marriage - she told him
            of her fears: &quot;I want to be Mrs. Reed, really. I want to be everything
            that name means to me. And I can't. I can't. Oliver, be kind, be
            patient. Let me have time. Time to get over that feeling there's
            something evil in me.&quot; She was obviously haunted by her inner demons,
            and when incensed could become a deadly black panther - in one exemplary
            scene, she clawed the sofa with her nails. She believed that she
            had inherited her Balkan family's ancient, supernatural and evil
            curse from the homeland - part of a legend that if she became sexually
            and passionately aroused, she might be transformed into an evil &quot;cat
            person&quot; or killer panther and hunt and kill her lover. In two frightening
            horror set-pieces, the jealous feline Irena stalked rival female
            Alice Moore (Jane Randolph), Oliver's American co-worker assistant,
            first during Alice's spooky night walk on a Central Park path, and
            a second similar scene in a YWCA indoor swimming pool. Over time
            as Oliver's and Irena's marriage became more estranged, Alice fell
            in love with Oliver, and he announced that he intended to divorce
            Irena, intensifying her vengeful thoughts and jealousies. In consultation
            with Irena's treacherous psychiatrist Dr. Judd (Tom Conway), Oliver
            and Alice were also planning on either having Irena committed to
            a mental hospital for therapy, or annulling Oliver's marriage. As
            the film was concluding, Alice and Oliver found themselves in their
            drafting room office stalked and confronted by a growling panther
            - Irena in animal form, although 
            Oliver was able to talk Irena into leaving them alone. Her tell tale
            perfume scent of Lalage identified her. In
            the film's ending, Dr. Judd - who had diagnosed that Irena's
            fears came from childhood traumas, foolishly thought he could cure
            her. After passionately kissing and advancing on Irena during a counseling
            session in the Reed's apartment, he suffered a predictable fate.
            She transformed into a black panther and shredded him to death. Irena
            escaped and fled to the Central Park Zoo, where she approached the
            cage of a black panther. With a stolen key, she opened the cage door
            and allowed the animal to suicidally attack her. It knocked her down
            with its powerful claws, and killed her with the blow. The panther
            then fled and was killed by a passing car (off-screen). Oliver and
            Alice raced to the zoo where they discovered the open panther cage
            and the body of Irena (in the form of a panther) lying nearby. Oliver
            knelt down to inspect the corpse, and spoke the film's final words
            to Alice: She never lied to us.&quot;</font></p>

              Walsh<br />
            Director Raoul Walsh's  entertaining, highly-fictionalized sports
            biography was about famous heavyweight boxer &quot;Gentleman
            Jim&quot; James J. Corbett (Errol Flynn). It
            was loosely based  upon James J. Corbett's own autobiography <i>The
            Roar of the Crowd</i>. The film was set in
            turn-of-the-century San Francisco. It followed
            his career from a poor, brawling Irish family, to a lowly job as
            a bank clerk, then an amateur boxer, and onto the professional level
            in the 1890s (&quot;the Naughty Nineties&quot;) - in the early days of bare-knuckled boxing.
             He was known for using  &quot;scientific&quot; boxing techniques - 
			 the first to &quot;dance&quot; around
            the ring with elusive footwork. He also found time to romance SF
            socialite love interest Victoria Ware (Alexis Smith), an ambivalent
            patrician belle who believed he had a &quot;swelled&quot; head, although
            she supported him. Boxing was being transformed from a lower-class,
            illegal sport with new Marquis of Queensberry rules - with three
            minute rounds, one minute between rounds, a ten-count, and no hitting
            below the belt. The brash, extroverted, stylish and charming Gentleman
            Jim cheerfully challenged John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond) to an 1892
            championship match, revealed in an exciting, action-packed sequence
            of 21 rounds.</font></p>          </td>

              D: Noel Coward, David Lean <br />
            This was the first film with a directorial credit by David Lean.
            The stirring, patriotic (propagandistic), British World War II drama
            told the story of the lives of the crew of a torpedoed British destroyer <i>HMS
            Torrin</i>, commanded by Captain E. V. Kinross R.N. (director Noel Coward) (aka
            Captain 'D'), sunk in the Battle of Crete in 1941 in the Mediterranean.
            It was based on the real-life experiences of Lord Louis Mountbatten,
            Captain of the Royal Navy destroyer named <i>HMS
            Kelly</i>, which was sunk by enemy action early in the war in May, 1941. It was filmed
            like a black and white documentary, with narration (by Leslie Howard)
            recounting the historic efforts of the three surviving crew members
            on a life raft, while they flashed back to memories of their loved
            ones and service to the ship. The three were: (1) Shorty Blake (John
            Mills), an ordinary seaman whose girlfriend was Freda Lewis (Kay
            Walsh), (2) Chief Petty Officer Walter Hardy (Bernard Miles) who
            was married to ill-fated pregnant Katherine Lemmon Hardy (Joyce Carey),
            and (3) Capt. Edward Kinross, with two children and wife Alix (Celia
            Johnson). It featured  two stirring speech sequences: an after-dinner
            speech by Alix, and Kinross' own concluding speech. The film closed
            with the narrator's words: &quot;God bless our ships
            and all who sail on them.&quot; </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Sam Wood<br />
            Director Sam Wood's romantic melodrama was a penetrating look at
            American morals (rivalries, jealousies, and sordid affairs) in a
            seemingly peaceful small rural Midwestern (Missouri) town, Kings
            Row, at the turn of the century. It had  a fantastic score by
            composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold (although unnominated for an Academy
            Award!). Two young men, future medical student Parris Mitchell (Robert
            Cummings) and wastrel playboy Drake McHugh (Ronald Reagan, in his
            career's best and most memorable role) grew up there. Other characters
            included the town's psychiatrist Dr. Alexander Tower (Claude Rains)
            and his unbalanced daughter Cassandra Tower (Betty Field), Drake's
            working class girlfriend Randy Monoghan (Ann Sheridan), and the troubled
            and sheltered Louise Gordon (Nancy Coleman), daughter of vengeful
            and moralistic surgeon Dr. Henry Gordon (Charles Coburn). When they
            reached adulthood, a series of tragic incidents revealed sadism,
            insanity, moral decay, deceitfulness, and pettiness deceptively hidden
            in the town. At one point, Drake's dating relationship with Louise
            was curtailed due to her uptight parents' feelings about him. And
            then home-schooled, restricted Cassie was poisoned by her father
            Dr. Tower (who wished to protect Parris from his insane daughter),
            who then suicidally shot himself (as an act of coverup or regret).
            Drake, who married girlfriend Randy, was unexpectedly the victim
            of a brutal Dr. Gordon - both of his legs were amputated following
            a railroad yard accident, prompting him to ask in the famous line: &quot;Where's
            the rest of me?&quot; [Note: Future 40th President  Ronald Reagan
            titled his 1965 autobiography with this line.] The film ended with
            Parris becoming the town's doctor after the death of Dr. Gordon,
            his truthful support of Drake in a triumphant conclusion, and his
            romancing of 19 year-old Elise Sandor (Kaaren Verne) who lived with
            her father in his former residence.</font></p></td>

                  (1942)</b></a><b>,</b> 88 minutes, D: Orson Welles<br />
            Producer/director Orson Welles' adaptation of Booth Tarkington's
            Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was a rich and dramatic period production,
            although Welles claimed it was &quot;ruined&quot; by the studio's
            intervention, editing, and censorship. The
            studio reshot some of the footage, re-edited the film down from the
            original length - 148 minutes - to 88 minutes. He stated that the
            studio misunderstood it and mutilated it with cuts, and added 
            a happy ending. It was Orson Welles' first film following his cinematic
            success with <i><a href="citi.html">Citizen
            Kane (1941)</a> </i> a year earlier. Welles both wrote the screenplay and directed this
            dramatic ensemble film, a favorite of the critics, and its score
            was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Its rich innovative cinematographic
            and audio techniques (by Stanley Cortez) were breathtaking, included
            contrasting light and dark shadows, deep-focus photography, moving
            dolly and truck camera shots, iris-in iris-out scene closings, and &quot;Welles
          sound&quot; montages. It was the 25-year saga
          (spanning two generations) of the decline of a wealthy midwestern Victorian
          family, the Ambersons, beginning in the pre-industrial period of the
          1890s and continuing into the more industrialized 20th century. Patriarchal
          and rich Major Amberson (Richard Bennett) headed the family, and lived
          in a modernized mansion with his one daughter Isabel Amberson (Dolores
          Costello). Young Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) loved Isabel, but she
            spurned his romantic intentions and married Wilbur Minafer (Donald
              Dillaway) instead. Her  spoiled, tyrannical and arrogant Oedipal
              youngest son George Amberson Minafer (Tim Holt), was very spoiled
              and hated by the entire town, who wished for him to receive his
              &quot;comeuppance.&quot; About twenty years later, Eugene (who
              had married and then was widowed), returned to the town as a successful
              automobile (&quot;horseless carriage&quot;) inventor/manufacturer,
              accompanied by his pretty grown-up daughter Lucy Morgan (Anne Baxter).
              Also living in the Amberson mansion was George's unmarried and
              destitute Aunt Fanny Minafer (Agnes Moorehead). Once Isabel became
              widowed, Eugene began to court her again, and Lucy and George fell
              in love - although George schemed to ruin and break up his mother's
              romantic relationship with Eugene. He prohibited Eugene from seeing
              his mother - and in part brought about her death and his own estrangement
              from Lucy. By this time, the Amberson family fortune
              was disappearing and collapsing due to increasing industrialization,
              while Eugene's automobile industry was fluorishing. Tragedy struck
              George (and brought him his &quot;comeuppance&quot;) when ironically,
              he was seriously injured when hit by a car. While in the hospital,
              he was reconciled with both Eugene and Lucy in his room. In the
              film's final line of dialogue, Eugene felt blessed by his memory
              of his true love Isabel: &quot;But it seemed to me as if someone
              else was in that room. And that through me, she brought
              her boy under shelter again, and that I'd been true at last to
              my true love.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

            This wacky, side-splitting classic screwball comedy was originally
            a smash Broadway hit play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, although
            stagey and dated on screen. A bombastic, cocky, and witty radio celebrity
            Sheridan Whiteside (Monty Woolley) on a lecture tour fell and broke
             his leg on slippery ice while in Mesalia, Ohio. The egotistical
            and abrasive Sheridan was forced to remain during the winter at the
            house of a local midwestern family - conservative businessman Ernest
            (Grant Mitchell) and his dotty matronly wife Daisy Stanley (Billie
            Burke) while he recuperated from his injury, aided by nurse Miss
            Preen (Mary Wickes). His hosts were driven crazy and relegated to
            the second floor, and the household was thrown into chaos by his
            unending eccentric demands, expensive long-distance phone calls,
            orders to the servants, his loud-mouthed obnoxious manner, exotic
            animals (an octopus and penguins), and an assortment of oddball friends
            that came to visit him. His trusted secretary Maggie Cutler (Bette
            Davis) fell in love with local newspaper man Bert Jefferson (Richard
            Travis), complicating everything when the conniving Sheridan hired
            gold-digging, narcissistic actress friend Lorraine Sheldon (Ann Sheridan)
            to seductively steal Maggie's love interest so that she wouldn't
             marry and then quit as his secretary. After Sheridan discovered
            that his leg was actually fine, he bribed Dr. Bradley (George Barbier)
            to prolong his stay, and used blackmail (the threat to reveal that
            the Stanley's nutty sister Harriet (Ruth Vivian) was once put away
            for being an axe murderer) to remain ensconced. </font></p></td>

            war drama (Best Picture winner, with five other Oscars) and box-office
            hit from MGM was adapted from the 1939 novel by Jan Struther (first
            appearing in a serialized newspaper column in <i>The London Times</i>).
            Its sequel was <i>The Miniver Story (1950, UK)</i> with Greer Garson
            and Walter Pidgeon reprising their roles. This
            idealized pro-British film followed the lives of beleaguered but
            courageous British villagers who faced tremendous trials, hardships,
            and dangers during World War II and the Nazi aggression. In the town
            (fictional) of Belham outside of London in the Thames Valley, the
            upper middle-class Miniver family, headed by architect Clem (Walter
            Pidgeon) and Kay Miniver (Oscar-winning Greer Garson), were living
            a bit extravagantly. Clem purchased a new car, while Kay had just
            gone on a shopping spree in London. In their home (named Starlings),
            the family welcomed their eldest Oxford-educated son Vin (Richard
            Ney) back from school. The most important event of the village was
            the village's annual flower show, with competing roses grown to contend
            against the perennial winner - the rich head of Beldon Hall manor
            Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty). At home, Vin fell in love in Lady
            Beldon's 18 year-old grand-daughter Carol Beldon (Oscar-winning Teresa
            Wright). Faced with the onset of war, Vin entered the Royal Air Force
            (RAF), and was stationed at a local airfield, and was able to assist
            his boat-owning father Clem in the Dunkirk evacuation (with dramatic

            One day, Mrs. Miniver was confronted in her garden by a
              downed, wounded and threatening German paratrooper (Helmut Dantine)

              he passed out and then disarmed him and notified the police. Vin

              Rose&quot;) was the real winner against her Beldon Rose. Kay and Carol
              were caught in an air raid after leaving the flower show and dropping
              Vin off at the airfield. On their way to Starlings, they witnessed
              a dogfight and a German plane crash. Carol was unexpectedly hit
              by machine-gun fire and soon after died. In
              the inspiring finale, the courageous villagers assembled in the
              bombed-out village church (or cathedral) to sing &quot;Onward Christian
              Soldiers&quot; as proof that there would always be an England. The church's vicar
              (Henry Wilcoxon) read from Psalm 91 and delivered a moving, patriotic
              speech (&quot;This is the people's war! It
              is our war! We are the fighters! Fight it then! Fight it
              with all that is in us, and may God defend the right!&quot;). Through

            Director Irving Rapper's  sentimental, superb, romantic soap opera
            and tearjerker featured great performances and a lush Max Steiner
            score. Its title was based on Walt Whitman's 1900 work <i>Leaves
            of Grass</i> and the poem &quot;The Untold Want&quot;: &quot;Now, Voyager, 
			sail thou forth to seek and
            find.&quot; In the plot, a shy, disturbed, dowdy and lonely middle-aged
            spinster, Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) from a prominent Boston family
            was dominated and tormented by her mean, unloving mother Mrs. Henry
            Windle Vale (Gladys Cooper). Sheltered ugly duckling Charlotte was
            helped by kindly psychiatrist Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains) at his clinic
            to assist her in blossoming into a swan - she was brought out of
            her shell to become a lovely, confident young woman. Charlotte took
            an ocean cruise to discover herself and met handsome, but unhappily
            married Jerry Durrance (Paul Henreid). They engaged in an affair
            and entered into an ill-fated romance - because he could never leave
            his wife. Returning to Boston, she resisted falling under her mother's
            domination and was liberated from maternal control. Her mother suffered
            a stroke when Charlotte broke off her engagement to eminent Bostonian
            Elliot Livingston (John Loder) after meeting Jerry again. Charlotte
            returned to Jaquith's clinic to resolve feelings of guilt and there
            identified with and helped Jerry's shy, withdrawn daughter Tina (Janis
            Wilson), who had been rejected by her mother too. By coming close
            to Tina as a surrogate mother, she brought Jerry back into her life.
            The film famously included the memorable scenes of Durrance
            lighting two cigarettes at once, one for Charlotte.</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Preston Sturges<br />
            This was one of the best of Preston Sturges' fast-paced, zany and
            madcap screwball comedies with snappy dialogue, that was originally
            titled: 'Is Marriage Necessary?' The frenzied opening credits marriage
            sequence in 1937 was set to the tune of the<i> William Tell Overture</i> -
            it was a deliberately puzzling, freeze-frame montage of confusing,
            mystifying marital vignettes without dialogue (unexplained until
            film's end, when it was revealed that both fiancee-protagonists were
            identical twins, and each married the wrong person!). The film officially
            opened with the end of the five-year marriage in 1942 of struggling,
            poor, stingy architectural engineer/inventor Tom (Joel McCrea) to
            his frustrated, slightly wacky, but ambitious wife Gerry Jeffers
            (Claudette Colbert) who was concerned about growing debts. As she
            was preparing to leave their Park Avenue apartment in NYC, the couple
            met the half-deaf Texas &quot;Wienie King&quot; (Robert Dudley), 
			a sausage manufacturer, who was apartment-hunting
            and offered the destitute couple $700 (for back rent, a new dress
            and salon visit, and dinner). Shortly after, Gerry departed and boarded
            a train southbound for posh Palm Beach, Florida, to get a divorce.
            She theorized that she could make him happy by becoming an &quot;adventuress&quot;
          - finding a new, wealthy husband (pre-approved and in his 
          &quot;good graces&quot;) who might help him realize his ambitions and
          offer a business partnership to support him. Her actual scheme was
          to help finance her husband's inventions (and plans for a $99,000 airport)
          by locating a rich bank-rolling financier. On the train, she encountered
          a group of tipsy millionaire hunters in the Ale
          and Quail Club, led by First Member (William Demarest), an unruly group
          of aging and wealthy sportsmen. On the train in the
          sleeping berth area, she met the wacky, clumsy and eccentric character
          of crackpot billionaire J.D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallee).
           J.D. fell madly in love with Gerry and pursued her with wealth and
          riches.  At the West Palm Beach dock, Hackensacker was greeted by his eccentric, carefree, man-crazy,
          oversexed, fast-talking oddball heiress sister Princess/Countess Centimillia
          (known as &quot;Maude&quot;) (Mary Astor) - the five-time-married Princess Centimillia had been
          divorced three times. She also met the Princess' flaunted kept-man
          companion Toto (Sig Arno). Things got more complicated, hilarious and interesting when Gerry's estranged
          husband Tom arrived in West Palm Beach, Florida (financed by the &quot;Wienie
          King&quot;) to jealously win her back. He took advantage of complicated
          mistaken identities, when it was deceptively claimed that he was Gerry's
           brother Captain McGlue. The Princess immediately fell for Tom (Gerry
          claimed he was not married but &quot;entirely free&quot;) and she invited
          both of them to stay at her mansion. Gerry was immediately worried
          that Tom might ruin Hackensacker's offer to pay $99,000 for her divorce,
          and to also bankroll his fanciful plan of a &quot;suspended airport&quot; for
          $100,000. Ultimately, Gerry announced to Hackensacker that she had
          decided to return (with McGlue) to her husband back in NYC. Even so,
          Hackensacker promised to keep his promise as a benefactor to finance
          McGlue's airport for $100,000. When  Gerry revealed the entire
          masquerade, Hackensacker continued to insist on financing the Jeffers' airport as a good business
          decision. Due to a lucky coincidence (or weak plot contrivance) that both Tom and Gerry were identical twins,
            there was a return to the wedding altar sequence in the prologue.
          Centimillia married Tom's identical twin brother, and Gerry's identical
          twin sister married Hackensacker. Tom and Gerry stood by on the left
          as Best Man and Bridesmaid. A caption appeared: &quot;and they lived
          happily ever after, or did they?&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Pride of the Yankees (1942),</b> 127 minutes,
              D: Sam Wood<br />
            Director Sam Wood's  exceptional sports biography was about  one
            of the greatest baseball players ever - Yankee first baseman Lou
            Gehrig (Gary Cooper), following his life from his playground days
            to New York Yankee stardom in the 1920s and 30s. The film chronicled
            the struggles of his immigrant parents, his early life, his romantic
            courtship and marriage to Eleanor (Teresa Wright), his sports career,
            and his courageous fight against a terminal disease. At the height
            of his career, he was afflicted by a crippling, lethal and incurable
            muscle-nerve disease - ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (now
            bearing his name &quot;Lou Gehrig's Disease&quot;) and eventually
            died. The film opened with his strong-willed, old-fashioned and determined
            mother (Elsa Janssen), a cook at Columbia University, insisting that
            her young son Lou Gehrig (Douglas Croft as boy) plan on becoming
            an engineer like his university-educated Uncle Otto. However, as
            a Columbia University student and ballplayer, Henry Lou Gehrig (Gary
            Cooper) made quite an impression by hitting a home run through
            a window of the school's Athletic Department. He was  befriended
            and approached by <i>Evening Standard</i> sportswriter Sam Blake
            (Walter Brennan), who told a disbelieving Gehrig that  the Yankees
            team was interested in him. He was soon secretly
            signed with the Yankees (but kept the news from his mother) - his
            intention was to help pay for her private hospital bills. Mom
            Gehrig discovered his career as a ballplayer, and expressed her utter
            disappointment in him, so he made a suggestion: &quot;Why
            don't you come out some afternoon and watch me play so you can judge
            for yourself?&quot; - she eventually acquiesced. Stadium spectator
            Eleanor Twitchell (Teresa Wright) (nicknamed &quot;the Hot Dog King's
            daughter&quot;) teasingly called rookie Gehrig a &quot;Tanglefoot&quot; when
            he stumbled over a row of bats in front of the dugout during a game
            at Chicago's Comiskey Park when he was called for his first appearance
            at bat - the name stuck: &quot;Mr. Tanglefoot.&quot; In
            the film, Babe Ruth (as Himself) made a cameo appearance as rookie
            Gehrig's Yankee teammate. There were two opposing opinions about
            Gehrig: Sam called him  &quot;The best of 'em,&quot; while rival
            sportsman Hank Hanneman (Dan Duryea) called Gehrig &quot;the chump
            of all time&quot; and &quot;a boob with a batting eye.&quot; Gehrig
            soon was courting  Eleanor, including taking her to an amusement
            park where he hit baseballs, won prizes, and loaded her up with a
            handful of stuffed animals. In a  re-enacted scene, Gehrig 
            visited a hospital to see an 8-year old crippled boy named Billy
            (Gene Collins), who challenged him to hit two home runs in
            the 1928 World Series game (against St. Louis) that afternoon for
            the boy. Gehrig fulfilled his promise and hit two homers to win the
            game - while Billy listened on the radio.  Gehrig
            and Eleanor were married by the Mayor of New Rochelle, NY, and then
            they sped of ftogether (with a motorcycle police escort)  to the
            ball park for batting practice and a game. Due to his uncurable and
            debilitating disease of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in his
            mid-30s, Gehrig slowly began to experience physical deterioration,
            including muscle weakness, lack of coordination, and slowness that
            affected his game play. Devastating bad
            health news (using baseball metaphors) was delivered by Lou Gehrig's
            doctor (Edward Fielding): &quot;It's three strikes.&quot;  By
            this time, older 17 year-old Billy (David Holt)  
            told Gehrig that he had made a full recovery after being inspired by his hero. 
			The sensitive portrayal, endearing and touchingly portrayed, was especially emotional in the
            final scene - Gehrig's memorable July 4th, 1939 farewell address
            at Yankee Stadium: &quot;...People all say that I've had a bad break. But today - today I consider
              myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.&quot; The
              film's last image was of Gehrig walking slowly by himself (away
              from the camera) and back to the dugout, to disappear from baseball
              forever. One could hear the umpire in the background cry out: &quot;Play
              ball!&quot; as the film ended. </font></p>          </td>

              LeRoy<br />
            MGM's and director Mervyn LeRoy's sentimental, moving and touching
            melodramatic romance with an implausible and contrived plot (based
            on the James Hilton novel) - was about an amnesia victim who forgot
            the woman he had loved and married. Shell-shocked and mute World
            War I Army officer (Ronald Colman) suffered from amnesia and was
            renamed John Smith (or &quot;Smithy&quot;), at the Melbridge County
            Asylum. The man without a past walked away from the facility
            during a foggy Armistice celebration in 1918, and in the nearby town
            of Melbridge, he met  music dance hall singer/performer
            stage-named Paula Ridgeway (British actress Greer Garson), a showgirl
            for a traveling troupe. After a short romance, they were happily
            married, moved into a small rented cottage in Devon, and had a son
            together during a three year period. Before a short trip to 
            Liverpool to apply for a job at the <i>Mercury</i> newspaper, Smithy
            left Paula with a gift - a glass-bead necklace (&quot;the color of
            her eyes&quot;). In Liverpool as he crossed a rainy street, a
            sudden shock to his head from a taxi-cab accident caused him to regain
            his former memory/life from three years earlier as Sir Charles Rainier
            (also Ronald Colman) - a Captain in the Wessex Regiment, in Surrey.
            His past was remembered, but his recent present and life together
            with Paula was completely forgotten. In his home in Surrey, Charles
            inherited the family's industrial factory-business following his
            father's death - and became known as the &quot;Industrial Prince
            of England.&quot; After a few years, Charles' younger step-niece by marriage, Kitty
            Chilcet (Susan Peters) fell in love with him - her 'uncle.' He agreed
            to marry her and they were engaged, but he knew deep inside that
            something was missing from their romance. He suspected that a latch-key
            hanging from his watch-chain was a vital clue to his past. Paula
            tracked him down, found him busy at work, reentered his life
              as Margaret Hansen, and became his devoted
              private secretary. On the advice of Dr. Jonathan Benet
            (Philip Dorn), however, she did  not
              reveal her identity or their past life together (or that their
              son had died), and she annulled their previous marriage. She
              persistently but patiently hoped his memory would return, and attempted
              to rekindle their relationship which he couldn't remember. Realizing
              that Charles was distant, loved someone else, and was not fully
            committed to marriage with her, Kitty called off the wedding, leaving
            him depressed. When he was called upon to serve in Parliament as
            a Conservative Party member, Charles felt the need to be married
            to assume the vaulted position. He  turned
              to his faithful secretary Paula and asked her for marriage &quot;in
            friendship&quot; for convenience sake - as a &quot;merger&quot; in
            name only. Paula accepted Charles' proposal but it was painful for
            her to have an unemotional, unfulfilled, loveless pairing with him.
            In the film's concluding sequence, Paula planned to take a holiday
            and visit South America on a sea voyage, but first decided to spend
            some time in Devon to remember the wonderful days she had spent there
            with Smithy. At the same time, Charles visited a factory in Melbridge
            due to workers agitating for a strike. Slowly, Charles began to retrace
            his steps and recall his past days in the area. He decided to visit
            Devon. Both of them happened to be at the gate to their old cottage
            - where Charles realized the latch-key on his watch-chain opened
            the front door. Paula softly called out to him at the door: (&quot;Smithy?
            Oh, Smithy! Oh, darling&quot;). He  was jarred
            into remembering his past life with his true love and became fully
            reunited with her in the familiar setting.</font></p>          </td>

                  Kong (1933)</i></a>) - symbolizing the victory of democracy
                  over tyranny. The patriotic film was a forerunner to similar
                  themes in Hitchcock's <a href="nort.html"><i>North by Northwest

          In the film's opening scene, set at the Stewart
          Aircraft Works plant in Glendale, CA, suburban LA, aircraft
          munitions worker Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) found himself accused
          of sabotage - setting fire to the factory. In the presence of an unfamiliar

          and falsely accused of the fiery death of his best friend and co-worker

                   began a journey as a fugitive to locate Fry and clear his
                  name. Clues led him to Deep Springs Ranch in Springfield, California,

                  owner and philanthropist, Charles Tobin (Otto Kruger) with
                  his daughter Mrs. Brown (Kathryn Adams). He confronted the
                  crooked Tobin, accusing him of covering up for the &quot;saboteur&quot; Fry
                  and being mixed up in sabotage at the aircraft plant. Although
                  Tobin had Kane arrested, he escaped from the police by jumping
          off a bridge. Seeking refuge in the cabin of  blind composer Philip
          Martin (Vaughan Glaser), Kane met Martin's visiting niece -  NY billboard
          blonde model  Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Martin (Priscilla Lane). When
          she attempted to turn Kane in, he abducted her, and they both ended
          up in the deserted ghost-town of Soda City, where in a cabin hideout
          near Hoover Dam (another target), Kane was confronted by two other
          saboteurs: sinister, sexually-ambiguous Mr. Freeman (Alan Baxter) and
          Neilson (Clem Bevans). He convinced them to offer him safe passage
          to NYC. Meanwhile, Pat reported Kane to a local Sheriff after they
          left - not knowing that the Sheriff was one of the conspirators. In
          NY, Kane was taken to the mansion of another co-conspirator - wealthy
          dowager Mrs. Henrietta Sutton (Alma Kruger) who was generously
          funding the saboteurs. He discovered Pat was being held there too,
          and that Tobin, who was present, was the major 
          mastermind of the fifth columnists. Tobin feared that their  
          operation at Hoover Dam had been compromised and had to be abandoned,
          and then announced that Kane was truly an imposter. The villains' next
          target was the battleship <i>U.S.S. Alaska</i> during its christening
          at the Brooklyn naval yards. Kane was able to foil the saboteurs' plans
          at the shipyard, leading to the exciting climax of the film, when both
          Pat and Kane pursued Frank Fry as he fled and ended up at &quot;Liberty
          Island&quot; where the Statue of Liberty was located. In a frightening,
          harrowing scene high up above the water of NY harbor, Kane confronted
          Fry  on the viewing platform on the statue's torch, when Fry lost his
          balance. Kane reached out to save him by grabbing his coat jacket,
          but when the jacket sleeve tore along the seam, Fry fell to his death. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: George Stevens<br />
            Director George Stevens' intelligent screwball comedy was about
             a love triangle between a woman, a suspected murderer and a celebrated
            defense attorney. An avowed anarchist, factory worker Leopold Dilg
            (Cary Grant) was a fugitive from justice who was falsely wanted and
            framed by his employer for murder/manslaughter and the arson of the
            factory. He escaped into the countryside and sought refuge in the
            attic of a rented summer house, being prepared by sympathetic school
            teacher Nora Shelley (Jean Arthur) for an unsuspecting vacationing
            law professor Michael Lightcap (Ronald Colman). Dilg posed as the
            gardener while he attempted to prove his innocence. The stuffy renter,
            a strict law-and-order man and a Supreme Court judge appointee,
            took a liking to the fugitive as they engaged in a series of witty
            debates and discussed the justice system. The judge defended Dilg
            from an angry lynch mob in the final trial, clearing him of the charges.
            The final scene revealed the man who Nora romantically chose (one
            of the film's two possible endings). </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>This Gun for Hire (1942), </b>80 minutes, D: Frank
              Tuttle<br />
            This atmospheric, sinister, <i>film noir</i> mystery from Paramount
            Studios was an adaptation from Graham Greene's novel <i>A Gun for
            Sale</i>. It was remade as director James Cagney's <i>Short Cut to Hell (1957)</i>.
            This was the first of four pictures teaming Alan Ladd with co-star
            Veronica Lake due to their great on-screen chemistry, followed by
            two other great noirs: <i>The Glass Key (1942)</i> and <i>The
            Blue Dahlia (1946)</i>, and <i>Saigon (1948)</i>. Paid professional
            killer Philip Raven (Alan Ladd), after committing two murders for
            hire, sought revenge after being double-crossed by double-agent Willard
            Gates (Laird Cregar) and chemical company president Alvin Brewster
            (Tully Marshall). Super-sultry, peek-a-boo blonde nightclub singer/magician 
			Ellen Graham (Veronica Lake) was drawn
            into the hunt after meeting by accident (and sharing a common enemy,
            Gates) the murderous, cold-blooded hired gun
            Raven, who admitted he was abused as a child. As their relationship
            progressed, she attempted to understand the
            assassin's &quot;soft side.&quot; The pair struggled to avoid police who were 
              led by Ellen's boyfriend - police investigator Michael Crane (Robert
            Preston), as Raven tracked his double-crossing smugglers down to
            a secret plant where the spy ring manufactured poison gas to sell
            to Japan - the wartime enemy. In the rousing conclusion, Brewster
            attempted to kill Raven but died of heart failure, while Raven shot
            Gates dead. Raven was lethally-wounded by police, but did not shoot
            Michael because Ellen was helping him. As Raven died, they found
            the sabotagers' written confession exonerating Raven.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Ernst Lubitsch<br />
            Director Ernst Lubitsch's  controversial and classic black comedy
            satire propagandized and exposed the real nature of the Nazis by
            lampooning the Third Reich and its leader - a message that used humor
            to deliver a powerful message against tyranny. [Note: It was similar
            to Charlie Chaplin's <i>The Great Dictator (1940)</i> in its satirization
            of the Gestapo, Hitler, and the Nazi movement.] In Nazi-occupied
            Warsaw in 1939, members of a shabby Polish Shakespearean
            theatrical troupe were rehearsing  their anti-Nazi
            play <i>Gestapo </i>at Theatre Polsky<i>. </i>The lead egocentric
            actor was Joseph Tura (Jack Benny) who was co-starring with his flirtatious
            wife Maria (Carole Lombard in her final screen appearance, before
            her tragic death in a plane crash). When the authorities censored
            and shut down the play shortly before the invasion of Poland in the
            spring of 1940, the actors were only allowed to perform a production
            of Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>. The hammy and vain Joseph in the lead role 
			gave a priceless imitation of Hamlet. During his oft-delivered &quot;To Be or Not
            to Be&quot; soliloquy, Tura was often flustered when an audience
            member in the second row, fugitive Polish bomber pilot-aviator and
            a member of the RAF in England, Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack)
            - who was madly in love with Tura's actress wife Maria, would leave
            to flirt with her in her dressing room. Maria continued to consent
            to illicit meetings with Sobinski, upsetting her husband. The main
            plot was the troupe's attempt to prevent Professor
            Alexander Siletsky (Stanley Ridges) from fulfilling his traitorous
            mission. He was  an imposter-Nazi spy posing as a Polish resistance
            leader sent from England to Poland, who had in his possession
            the names of the Polish underground resistance to relay to the Gestapo.
            To fool the inquisitive Nazis, Tura disguised himself as the bumbling
            Col. Ehrhardt (Sig Ruman), aka &quot;Concentration
            Camp&quot; Ehrhardt, to keep Siletsky from ever meeting the real
            Ehrhardt and exposing names. After Siletsky became suspicious and
            realized he had been duped, he fled but was shot dead by Lt. Sobinsky.
            Tura was then able to impersonate and pass himself off as Siletsky
            in a meeting with the real Ehrhardt. When the masquerade was eventually
            discovered, the actors had to devise a new ploy. During the Nazi's
            staging of a show at the theater to honor Hitler, Sobinski, Tura
            and the other actors dressed as Nazi officials, with Bronski (Tom
            Dugan) posing as Hitler in order to fool the real Gestapo officers
            into vacating the theater. Afterwards, Col. Ehrhardt was also led
            to believe that he was caught having an affair with the Fuhrer's
            mistress Maria. Feeling shocked for betraying his Fuhrer (actually
            Bronski), Ehrhardt allowed her to escape and then attempted to shoot
            himself. She joined the other troupe actors on Hitler's own plane
            to flee to Great Britain. There, the acting troupe continued to perform <i>Hamlet</i> in
             Shakespeare's homeland. Again to his surprise, Tura's performance
            was married by disruptions from an officer leaving the second
            row during his soliloquy. Remade as a comedy <i>To Be
              or Not to Be (1983)</i>, by director Mel Brooks who took the Jack
            Benny role, renamed 'Frederick Bronski.'</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Woman of the Year (1942), </b>112 minutes, D:
              George Stevens<br />
            Director George Stevens' witty romantic comedy-drama (and a semi-screwball
            comedy) about gender roles was originally developed by Garson Kanin
            (with an Oscar-winning script by Ring Lardner, Jr. and Michael Kanin).
            This marked the first onscreen pairing of Tracy and Hepburn (the
            first of nine such films that lasted over a period of 25 years).
            It was a charming film with superb acting, dialogue and chemistry
            between the two actors. Successful New York newspaper sportswriter
            Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) worked for the same newspaper as celebrated,
            sophisticated, no-nonsense, career-minded political columnist Tess
            Harding (Katharine Hepburn). She claimed to know everything but sports
            and domesticity, so he decided to teach her about the simple pleasures
            of life. They first met after he angrily responded in a column to
            her unpopular opinion that baseball games should be suspended during
            the war. The opposites (or odd-couples) were semi-attracted to each
            other and married, but found that they had very little in common
            with each other. She was clueless when he took her to a daytime baseball
            game - a classic scene. The plot highlighted their strained marital
            relationship: her inabilities as a housewife although she was a devoted
            career-woman feminist, while he drank, had typical male expectations
            and resented her working career. The film included the famous final
            scene of Tess attempting to cook breakfast (coffee, waffles, and
            eggs) in his kitchen, with disastrous results. In the film's conclusion,
            she considered getting divorced, but then was chosen &quot;Woman
            of The Year.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Michael Curtiz<br />
            Director Michael Curtiz' somewhat fictionalized rags-to-riches, All-American
            biography and grand musical became one of Hollywood's greatest musicals,
            and was the highest-grossing film of the year. It was notable for
            having its energetic tough-guy star, James Cagney, honored as the
            first Academy Award Oscar for Best Actor for a performance in a musical.
            Cagney reprised his role as George M. Cohan in <i>The Seven Little
            Foys (1955)</i>. With fancy footwork and memorable flag-waving
            tunes (such as &quot;Over There,&quot; You're a Grand Old Flag,&quot; and &quot;Yankee
            Doodle Dandy&quot;), this was the film that helped to build World
            War II morale on the homefront. The wartime musical,
            mostly told in flashback, was about the legendary life of Cohan,
            the early 20th century vaudevillian song and dance (hoofer) man,
            prodigious Broadway playwright and songwriter (with at least three
            dozen-produced Broadway musical shows and more than 300 songs). Born
            on the 4th of July, the immensely patriotic showman Cohan (James
            Cagney) related his life story in flashback to President Franklin
            Delano Roosevelt (Captain Jack Young, only viewed from the back).
            He was a member of a vaudevillian family including his father Jerry
            (Walter Huston), mother Nellie (Rosemary DeCamp), and sister Josie
            (Jeanne Cagney). Through sheer determination and talent, he became
            the most famous performer, songwriter and screen writer (aka &quot;the
            man who owned Broadway&quot;).</font></p>          </td>
