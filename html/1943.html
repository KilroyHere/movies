          <p><font size="2"><b>Cabin in the Sky (1943), </b>98 minutes, D: Vincente
              Minnelli<br />
            Director Vincente Minnelli's debut film, released in sepia-tone,
            was a noteworthy film from the Alan Freed production unit at MGM.
            It was based on Vernon Duke-Lynn Root's hit 1940 Broadway musical
            (directed by George Balanchine), and was Hollywood's first general
            release of an all-star, all-black musical, taken directly from its
            original Broadway production. It was only the fourth all-black cast
            film to be made, after <i>Hallelujah (1929)</i>, <i>Hearts in Dixie (1929), 
			</i>and <i>The Green Pastures (1936)</i>. It starred the
            Duke Ellington Orchestra and Louis Armstrong as the Trumpeter, and
            Cab Calloway, and was noted as having the first appearance of the &quot;moon
            walk&quot; dance step. Its many songs included
          Arlen and Harburg's &quot;Happiness is a Thing Called Joe&quot; - nominated for Best Song. While
          the film was pretty dated and contained some racial stereotypes, it
          was marked by great musical performances, the most noteworthy of which
          came from Waters, who performed the hit standards &quot;Taking a Chance
          on Love&quot; and the Oscar-nominated Best Song &quot;Happiness is a Thing Called
          Joe.&quot; Waters was a trailblazer for African-American performers, becoming the first
          African-American star of a national radio show before becoming the
          titular star of television's <i>The Beulah Show.</i> The
          delightful, energetic, and extravagantly-executed story, really a moralistic
          Faustian fable, told about a tug of war between good and evil. It told
          about a boozing and womanizing Joseph 'Little Joe' Jackson (Eddie Anderson
          with his first and sole film role, later known for his popular appearances
          as &quot;Rochester&quot; with Jack Benny on radio and TV), a shiftless gambler
              of questionable morals, who was having a lustful, extramarital
              affair. He was shot and killed at the Paradise Club during a barroom-brawl
              argument over his gambling debts. Immediately in a fantasy dream
              sequence, there was competition for his soul between God's General
              (Kenneth Spencer) in Heaven and the Devil's son Lucifer Jr. (Rex
              Ingram) in Hell. The General was summoned by the prayers of his
              gospel-quoting, devoted and religious wife Petunia Jackson (Ethel
              Waters). It was decided that Little Joe's soul would have a trial
              period of six months on Earth, to test his virtue and see whether
              he would reform. Lucifer Jr. tempted him with winning $50,000 in
              the Irish Sweepstakes, and added an additional temptation - the
              seductive alluring charms of the evil, sultry and beautiful singer
              Georgia Brown (Lena Horne). The sexy temptress was sent by
            the devil to win over Little Joe's soul and force him to give up
            Petunia. [Note: In the same year, screen legend Lena Horne also
          starred as Selina Rogers in <i>Stormy Weather (1943)</i>.]</font></p>          </td>

        63 minutes, D: Humphrey Jennings<br />
        This classic, dramatized (or recreated) British wartime documentary
        was made by the Crown Film Unit with director Humphrey Jennings (his
        sole feature film). It was created as a tribute to
        the civilian fighters of London's Auxiliary (or Voluntary) Fire Service
        during WWII. It told about the heroic firefighting missions of a crew
        to save some of London's structures from burning, during Luftwaffe
        blitz bombing raids in 1940 during the night, signaled by air-raid sirens
        and anti-aircraft fire. It followed, over a fictional 24-hour period,
        the experiences of well-educated new recruit Barrett (William Sansom),
        a former advertising copywriter just transferred to the unit. In the
        firestation, he joined others as they prepared for a night of fire-fighting
        at an explosives warehouse near the Thames docks of London's East

            cast of  film stars of the 30s and 40s, to promote the British-American
            war cause. Filmed by many directors, it was the story about the inhabitants
            of a great manor house in London over many generations. The manor's
            history spanned more than 100 years from the time of its construction
            in Napoleonic times in the early 1800s by Admiral Eustace Trimble
            (C. Aubrey Smith) to the WWII blitz of London in 1940. It was a great
            war morale booster highlighting the themes of British patriotism
            and England's survival from diverse threats as the house passed through
            the hands of many generations. Memorable parts and cameos were played
            by Charles Laughton (as comic butler Bellamy), Cedric Hardwicke and
            Buster Keaton (as plumbers Mr. Dabb and Wilkins), Claude Rains (as
            villainous patriarch Ambrose Pomfret), Jessie Matthews (as Mildred
            Trimble), Edward Everett Horton (as bumbling father Sir Anthony Trimble-Pomfret),
            Elsa Lanchester (as waitress-maid Mamie), Brian Aherne (as coal-man
            Jim Trimble), Ida Lupino (as feisty house-maid Jenny Jones), Roland
            Young and Gladys Cooper (as Mr. and Mrs. Henry Barringer, the parents
        of a WWII ace flyer who never appeared), and many, many more.</font></p></td>

              D: Sam Wood<br />
            Director Sam Wood's lengthy dramatic screen version of Ernest Hemingway's
            1940 controversial best-selling classic adventure novel of the Spanish
            Civil War in 1937 was about a passionate relationship between two
            individuals caught in the conflict. A Montana schoolteacher turned
            American mercenary Robert Jordan (Gary Cooper) fought for the Republican
            Loyalists against Franco's Nationalists (or Fascists), alongside
            a motley group of untrained Spanish guerrilla peasants, led by chieftain
            El Sordo (Joseph Calleia) and unstable alcoholic peasant Pablo (Akim
            Tamiroff) and his wife Pilar (Greek actress Katrina Paxinou), the
            rebels' de facto leader. The band of Loyalist resistance fighters
            was composed of a colorful group of characters and a cropped-haired
            refugee Maria (27 year-old Ingrid Bergman in her first color film),
            a Spanish orphan who had been emotionally traumatized after her mayoral
            father was murdered and she was raped by the enemy. The guerrillas
            struggled against overwhelming odds to destroy a strategic bridge
            behind enemy lines, and Jordan, a munitions expert, fell in love
            with blue-eyed, short-haired blonde Maria during their dangerous
            mission. Their passionate relationship included one of cinema's most
            famous kiss scenes as Maria pondered: &quot;I don't know how to kiss or I would kiss you. 
			Where do the noses go?&quot; With a sobering ending, when Jordan broke his leg and had to be left behind
            after delivering a soliloquy to Maria: (&quot;You go now, Maria...what
            I do now I do alone. I couldn't do it if you were here...There's
            no good-bye, Maria, because we're not apart&quot;) - as the bell
        tolled for his life and for the ill-fated couple. </font></p></td>

              Lubitsch<br />
            Director Ernst Lubitsch's heartwarming fantasy-romantic comedy
            from Fox Studios was the director's first and sole completed
            Technicolor film. This film was not to be confused with
             <i>Heaven Can Wait (1978)</i>, a remake of the 1941 comedy/drama <i>Here
            Comes Mr. Jordan</i>. Wealthy old playboy Henry Van Cleve
            (Don Ameche) passed away, after leading a life with many romantic
            indiscretions, flirtations, and seductive escapades extending from
            his early childhood through the days of his love and marriage to
            beautiful midwesterner Martha Strabel (Gene Tierney). In &quot;flashbacks&quot; about
             his carefree life story from infancy to age 70, the self-incriminating
            sinner had to convince His Excellency (Laird Cregar), the devilish
            Lord of Darkness, that he deserved to be admitted for punishment
            and eternal damnation. As it turned out, the cavalier Van Cleve was
            revealed to be good-natured, warm, kind-hearted, and sensitive -
            deserving of Heaven instead. He was, in fact, both a good father
            to son Jack (Tod Andrews) and a loyal (though sometimes philandering)
            husband married for 25 years to the gorgeous Martha. </font></p></td>

              Brown<br />
            Director Clarence Brown's low-key, sentimental but moving, superbly-acted
            drama was based on an original story by
            William Saroyan. The film was narrated (in voice-over) by recently-deceased
            Mr. Macauley (Ray Collins), the father of a family of four children
            in Ithaca, a small California valley town. Their everyday life was
            affected by the events of World War II and the need to cope with
            new responsibilities and hardships. The teenaged Macauley son, Western
            Union bicycle messenger Homer (Mickey Rooney) had to deliver mostly
            tragic war news to families about wounded or killed boys. A series
            of vignettes highlighted life in Americana as he came into close
            contact with all the families in town. He worked with 67-year-old
            alcoholic telegrapher Willie Grogan (Frank Morgan). Members of Homer's
            family included older brother Marcus (Van Johnson) off fighting in
            uniform - in love with college-aged neighbor Mary (Dorothy Morris),
            and Homer's younger six year-old kid brother Ulysses (Jackie 
          &quot;Butch&quot; Jenkins). Homer also had an older quiet college student
            sister Bess (Donna Reed) who was in love with telegraph office operator
            Tom Spangler (James Craig), Homer's boss, although Tom was engaged
          to upper-class socialite Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt).  One
          day, Homer had to deliver the news to his own family (and his widowed
          harp-playing mother Mrs. Macauley (Fay Bainter)) that big brother Marcus
          had been killed in battle. Marcus' best friend and service pal, orphaned
          and parentless Tobey George (John Craven), was more or less adopted
          by the Macauley family after the heart-tearing news.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>I Walked With A Zombie (1943)</strong>, 69
        minutes, D: Jacques Tourneur</font><br />
        <font size="2">Director Jacques Tourneur's zombie supernatural horror
        film, an other-worldly variant of the <i>Jane Eyre</i> novel by Charlotte
        Bronte, was produced by famed RKO producer Val Lewton, who had already
        worked on <a href="catp.html"><i>Cat People (1942)</i></a> and would soon produce <i>The
        Body Snatcher (1945)</i>. The low-budget, creepy film was very effective for its moody and atmospheric
        tone and visually-stylistic terror regarding dark family secrets, voodoo
        rituals and legends. The brooding, mystical melodrama told of the work
        of trained Canadian nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee). The retrospective
        film told in flashback was her narrated description, beginning with her
        recollection: &quot;I walked with a zombie.  It does seem an odd thing
        to say. Had anyone said that to me a year ago, I'm not at all sure I
        would have known what a zombie was....&quot; Betsy
          was hired to care for matriarchal Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon),
        the catatonic (trance-like), sleep-walking, comatose and semi-paralyzed
        invalid wife of melancholy Paul Holland (Tom Conway), a sugar plantation
              owner on the West Indies-Caribbean island of St. Sebastian. Jessica's
            doctor claimed that her catatonic condition (with
            no will of her own, no speaking, and seemingly lobotomized) was
          caused by an incurable tropical fever. By mid-film,
          Betsy had slowly begun to fall in love with guilt-ridden Paul, when
          she learned that Paul and his younger, alcoholic half-brother Wesley
          Rand (James Ellison) had a difficult relationship. The two brothers
          had earlier quarreled over the love of the afflicted woman in a love
          triangle, and Wesley had an affair with Jessica. Afterwards, Wesley
            blamed Paul for Jessica's condition.  Betsy was convinced
            that she could cure the &quot;living dead&quot; Jessica with a shot
            of insulin, but the shock treatment failed. She then learned from
            Jessica's native maid Alma (Teresa Harris) that a local voodoo priest
            had cured a woman with the same condition, and had brought the woman
            out of a catatonic state. Alma drew her a map
            to the &quot;Home Fort&quot; where a local voodoo ceremony would take place. In an
              unsettling nighttime scene, Betsy daringly escorted her patient,
              without permission, on a haunting, dream-like walk through the
              plantation's billowing cane fields to the ceremony. She had to
              pass animal sacrifices along the way. As she went through a crossroads,
              there was the abrupt and shocking appearance in the darkness of
              a huge, eerie, bug-eyed and towering zombie-like guard Carrefour
          (Darby Jones). Jessica was led to the dwelling
          (houmfort) of the voodoo worshippers. A major
          plot twist occurred next - Betsy entered a shack to consult with the
          voodoo witch doctor priestess, and discovered it was the matriarch
          of the family, Mrs. Rand (Edith Barrett) (who practiced voodoo in secret).
              When Mrs. Rand had discovered that her sons had fought over Jessica,
              Paul's wife, and threatened to break up the family (when Jessica
              threatened to run away with her lover Wesley), she had put a 'living
          dead' zombie curse on her. The disturbed Wesley
          continued to believe that Jessica was truly a zombie, and to rid her
          (and free her) of her condition, Wesley stabbed Jessica's heart with
          an arrow (mimicking a voodoo worshipper stabbing a doll). In a trance,
          after carrying her corpse to the sea, Wesley committed suicide by drowning.
          Carrefour - who had followed Wesley to the sea, brought Jessica's body
              back to the house. Now reunited with Betsy, Paul confessed to her
              that he would take her away from the island.</font></p>          </td>

                Stevenson<br />
              Although made as <i>Jane Eyre (1934)</i> a decade earlier by the
              poverty-row studio of Monogram, this was the first talking version
              of Charlotte Bronte's classic 1847 romantic story set in Victorian
              times. This 40s version faithfully adapted Bronte's tale with typical
              Gothic elements, a brooding atmosphere, and Bernard Herrmann's
              rich score. The screenplay was based on an adaptation of the novel
              for Orson Welles' radio show, <i>The Mercury Theatre on the Air</i>.
              Mistreated, unloved orphan girl Jane Eyre (Peggy Ann Garner as
              10 year old, Joan Fontaine as adult) was raised by mean and uncaring
              aunt Mrs. Reed (Agnes Moorehead) of Gateshead Hall. Arrangements
              were made for her to attend a boarding school named Lowood Institution,
              a charitable facility led by the harsh and self-righteous headmaster
              Reverend Henry Brocklehurst (Henry Daniell), where she befriended
              another student named Helen Burns (Elizabeth Taylor in an early
              uncredited role). At the age of 20, Jane was hired as the governess
              for a young girl named Adele (Margaret O'Brien) - the daughter
              of a wealthy Yorkshire Englishman. The huge mansion set on the
              bleak-looking moors of Yorkshire was called Thornfield Hall, and
              was run by housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax (Edith Barrett). Eventually,
              Jane met the darkly moody and hot-tempered owner, Edward Rochester
              (Orson Welles), and gradually was drawn into the mystery and dark
              secrets of Thornfield Hall - centering around a mysterious seamstress
              named Grace Poole (Ethel Griffies) who lived upstairs. Jane and
              Rochester also fell in love, and rather than marrying Blanche Ingraham
              (Hillary Brooke), Rochester asked for Jane's hand. The wedding
              ceremony was abruptly interrupted when an attorney contested the
              marriage - Rochester could not marry because he was still married
              to crazed, mentally ill spouse Bertha, who was guarded by Grace
              Poole. This was confirmed by Bertha's older brother Mason (John
              Abbott) of Spanish Town, in Jamaica. Jane was forced to depart
              from Thornfield, but returned after the death of her aunt to discover
              a burned-down Thornfield mansion. It had been set ablaze by Bertha,
              who jumped from the roof and died. Edward was also severely disabled,
              and left crippled and blind when the interior staircase collapsed
              on him. Jane remained and began to establish a relationship with
              Edward, and they were married. His sight miraculously began to
              return after the birth of their son.</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger <br />
              Powell and Pressburger's satirical character study was a controversial
          wartime film that angered Winston Churchill for its portrait of a 'fuddy-duddy'
          40 year career soldier, in the character of rotund Clive Candy (Roger
          Livesey).  &quot;Colonel Blimp&quot; in the film's title referred to
          a 1930s English cartoon character, not a real personage. The Technicolor
          film that satirized the British military establishment used the name
          of Sir David Low's comic strip, <i>The Life
          and Death of Colonel Blimp</i>.
              Although completed
              in 1943, this film was not released for showing in the US until
              1945, because it was banned for export from Britain due to its
              critical portrayal of staid British patriotism. The film told
              about the reminiscences of  staunch, rigid traditional British
              soldier/officer Clive Candy as he looked back on
              his life through three wars - the Boer War, World War I, and World
              War II. He still maintained outdated notions about how to be a
              gentlemanly soldier and conduct war by following the rules, unable
              to adapt to the methods and realities of modern warfare. During
              his life, Candy kept a friendship with his German counterpart -
              a former German soldier Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff (Anton Walbrook).
              During the course of his life, dedicated to the king and his country
              through changing times, he also met and loved three women: Edith
              Hunter / Barbara Wynne / Johnny Cannon (all played by Deborah Kerr
        in a very versatile role).</font></p>        </td>

            was the result of the success of the Best Picture-award winning <i>Mrs.
            Miniver (1942)</i>, in that it again paired Greer Garson and Walter
            Pidgeon (it was their third  of nine full-length feature films together,
            after <i>Blossoms in the Dust (1941)</i> and their 1942 film). Paul Osborn's and Hans
            Rameau's screenplay (with help from an uncredited Aldous Huxley)
              was adapted from the 1937 book <i>Madame Curie: A Biography, </i>by
            Eve Curie, Marie Curie's real-life daughter. It
            was a dramatic, B/W historical film biography (or biopic), with meticulous
            attention to science, about the quest and research of two famous
            pioneering scientists, the husband and wife team of the Nobel Prize-winning
            Curies, who discovered radium. It opened
            in the 1890s with the introduction of 
            the famous couple: shy and extremely-devoted physicist and avowed
            bachelor Pierre Curie (Walter Pidgeon) and a brilliant, poor but
            determined Polish student Marie Sklodowska (Greer Garson) at the
            Sorbonne working on her Master's Degree in Physics, who was recommended
            to work in Curie's laboratory. At first, he believed that no dedicated
            scientist could have any relationship with a woman (&quot;No true
            scientist can have anything to do with women&quot;). Their
              awkward and un-emotional but endearing love story, ending with
              a working partnership and marriage (to pursue their &quot;common
            scientific dream&quot;) overcame obstacles and ridicule. 
			They succeeded after a tedious, five-year experimental
            study in isolating and discovering a new and elusive radioactive
            element, radium. In the tragic conclusion, during a rainstorm, Pierre
            was run over by a horse-drawn carriage in the street and died. Twenty
            five years later (on the anniversary of their discovery) in the film's
            conclusion, continuing-researcher Marie lectured at the Sorbonne,
            declaring science &quot;the clear light of truth&quot; that could &quot;in time cleanse this
            world of its evils, its ignorance, its poverty, diseases, wars, and
            heartaches.&quot; She ended by advising her youthful audience to &quot;take

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Man in Grey (1943, UK)</b>, 116 minutes, D: Leslie Arliss<br />
          This was the  first of the quintessential Gainsborough Pictures costume
              melodramas, based upon the novel of the same name by Lady Eleanor
              Smith, with the themes of jealousy, doomed love and the elusive
              search for true love within a three-way love triangle. The psychological
              drama was told as a flashback by two strangers who met and realized
              that they were related descendants. They remembered their families'
              sordid history at an English estate auction (of the Rohan family)
              during WWII. The story revealed the fates of three characters -
              the first two met as female students at a boarding school and established
              a friendship: (1) the sweet, rich, innocent and beautiful heiress  student Clarissa
              Marr (Phyllis Calvert), and  (2)  the unkind Hesther Snow
              (Margaret Lockwood), a charity case who was mistreated by the headmistress
              and compelled to run away. Clarissa had a loveless marriage to (3) the handsome but cruel, decadent
              and hedonistic &quot;Man in Grey&quot; - nobleman Marquis Lord
              Rohan (James Mason). Clarissa became only a &quot;brood sow&quot;
          to produce children for her husband. An impoverished and bitter Hesther
          went on to become a traveling Shakespearean play actress, and soon
          schemed to enter the Rohan household as a governess for the Rohan's
          young son, while she engaged in an affair with Lord Rohan. At the same
          time (although away from the country estate), Clarissa had an affair
          with one of the Shakespearean actors in Hesther's troupe, a rogue named
          Peter Rokeby (Stewart Granger), while Hesther plotted to take her place
          as Rohan's wife. This was facilitated after Clarissa caught a fever
          watching Rokeby's ship depart in the rain, and Hesther insured her
          death by drugging her and causing her to catch deathly pneumonia. When
          the truth was revealed to Lord Rohan about his wife's murder, he went
          into a rage and  beat his new fiancee Hesther to death. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: George Stevens<br />
            Director George Stevens' and Columbia Pictures' terrific war-time
            romantic comedy featured excellent performances and an effervescent
            flair, although it reflected a dark time period during the war years
            when Americans on the homefront faced many hardships. It was remade
            as <i>Walk Don't Run (1966)</i> with Cary Grant (his last film). 
			In Washington DC during WWII, a housing
            (and single man) shortage developed, and young, prim and proper single
            working woman Connie Milligan (Oscar-nominated Jean Arthur) patriotically
            rented out part of her tiny apartment for a few days to an older,
            retired millionaire gentleman Benjamin Dingle (Oscar-winning Charles
            Coburn). Dingle decided to play Cupid for her, and rented out one-half
            of his half-apartment space to handsome Air Force airplane mechanic
            on special assignment Joe Carter (Joel McCrea), who was due to be
            shipped out to Africa shortly. In the midst
            of slapstick complications and humorous situations involving space
            and privacy, matchmaker Dingle was ultimately able to get the two
            romantically involved during his one-week trial period, although
            Connie continually and staunchly insisted that she was engaged to
            her pompous older boss - stuffed-shirt housing bureaucrat chief Charles
            J. Pendergast (Richard Gaines). The best
            scene in the film was a sexually-exciting brownstone apartment front
            steps kissing scene. Joe amorously embraced Connie - he caressed
            her, and fondly touched her hands, arms, and shoulders, and although
            she vainly attempted to ignore his advances to make out, she eventually
            took the two sides of his face with her hands and boldly kissed
            him back - harder. Her emotions for Pendergast were weakened by Joe's
            embraces and kisses. As they bedded down in adjacent rooms, they
            had their own version of the &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot; bedroom
            scene (from<i> <a href="itha.html">It Happened One Night (1934)</a></i>)
            between their apartment windows. The scene was shot from outside
            in a frame split by the wall between them, when they discussed how
            uncomfortable and restless they were, and Joe finally admitted: &quot;I
            love you Connie,&quot; and she responded likewise: &quot;I
          love you more than anything in the world.&quot; Trouble
          briefly arose when Joe was arrested by the FBI after being falsely
          reported to be a foreign agent (a Japanese spy) by a misinformed, gullible
          neighborhood boy. When Connie, Dingle and Pendergast all showed up
          at FBI headquarters to offer denials, Connie's betrothed, self-centered
          beau felt scandalized by the situation (that Joe was cohabitating in
          an apartment with his fiancee). With Dingle, Pendergast suggested that
          to clear his name, Connie must marry Joe -
              and then she could seek an immediate annulment afterwards. She
              agreed with the idea, and Joe and Connie  followed the scheme to
           avert the crisis. The two flew to South Carolina for a quickie marriage,
          and then returned to Connie's apartment. In their final night there,
          before Joe was to be deployed, Dingle had removed the wall separating their bedrooms. 
 		He delivered the final line - encouraging them to remain married: &quot;Damn the
            torpedoes! Full steam ahead!&quot; </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Ossessione (1943, It.) (aka Obsession)</strong>,
        140 minutes, D: Luchino Visconti<br />
        This early neo-realism film about a doomed and obsessed love affair (amour-fou)
        triangle was director Luchino Visconti's debut feature film. It was not
        related to director Brian De Palma's <i>Obsession
        (1976)</i> (a tribute to Hitchcock's<i> <a href="vert.html">Vertigo (1958)</a></i>),
        but instead to James M. Cain's novel &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; -
        and the two US film versions: the classic film noir in 1946 with Lana
        Turner and John Garfield, and the 1981 remake with Jessica Lange and
        Jack Nicholson. Without crediting Cain, Visconti made the film almost
        four years before the hard-boiled Hollywood version. Its explicit depiction
        of sex (and its homoerotic subtext) caused it to be banned by the Church,
        and ruthlessly edited and censored by Italian Fascist authorities, and
        the negative was destroyed. The only surviving film copy was Visconti's
        own slightly-shorter negative, which finally screened in the US in the
        mid-1970s, due to copyright issues. On the outskirts of Ferrara in Fascist
        Italy, virile, hot-headed and handsome drifter/car mechanic Gino Costa
        (Massimo Girotti) stopped at a small roadside inn (trattoria) and gas
        station, owned by old and corpulent Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa).
        The proprietor was married to the restaurant's cook - the dissatisfied,
              beautiful, passionate and sexy wife Giovanna
            Bragana (Clara Calamai), who married only for financial security
        - to escape poverty and prostitution. While Giuseppe went to town on
        an errand, Gino and Giovanna had illicit sex together. When Gino could
        not convince Giovanna to run away with him, he left alone. Gino befriended
        a roaming entertainer called Il Spagnolo (the Spaniard) (Elio Marcuzzo)
        and they lived together (as homosexuals?) in a flop-house in the seaport
        town of Ancona, and worked together as street magicians-entertainers.
        When the two protagonists Gino and Giovanna had a chance encounter a
        few months later, the two impulsively murdered her  inebriated
        husband Giuseppe, and made it look like a car accident. Although guilt-ridden
        and doubtful about their relationship, and suspicious of each other after
        Giovanna acquired a large life-insurance payout, the duo remained at
        the restaurant. However, Gino mistakenly believed that Giovanna had betrayed him to the police,
        although she denied it. The film ended abruptly with dire consequences
        - the brutal scene of pregnant Giovanna's accidental death in a car
        driven into the river by Gino - the film's second fatal car crash.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: William A. Wellman<br />
            Director William Wellman's masterful noirish film was adapted from
            the well-known unconventional western tale by Walter Van Tilburg
            Clark. In a western setting, it superbly portrayed the tyranny and
            lawlessness of mob rule. It was basically a somber morality-play
            set in the West in the late 1880s, regarding vigilante justice. The
            thought-provoking film was the inspiration for Sidney Lumet's courtroom
            drama <a href="twelve.html"><i>12 Angry Men (1957)</i></a>. In Nevada
            in 1885, two cowboy drifters, Gil Carter (Henry Fonda) and Art Croft
            (Henry/Harry Morgan) rode into Bridger's Wells, a small Nevada cattle
            town. After learning about a rash of rustling incidents in the area,
            they  quickly witnessed a lynch posse taking the law
            into its own hands without a fair trial. A local rancher named Larry
            Kincaid had allegedly been shot and killed during a cattle rustling,
            and a group quickly formed more intent on punishment than on justice.
            Storekeeper Arthur Davies (Harry Davenport) ineffectually implored
            that they cautiously not take any extreme actions until the Sheriff
            Risley (Willard Robertson) was notified about the alleged murder.
            The advice of Judge Daniel Tyler (Matt Briggs) was also powerless.
            With the Sheriff away, Deputy Sheriff &quot;Butch&quot; Mapes
            (Dick Rich) deputized the entire blood-thirsty lynch mob, led by
            pompous, vocal, and power-hungry Major Tetley (Frank Conroy), an
            ex-Confederate officer who took the law into his own hands. The demagogue
            Tetley was joined by iron-willed, heartless, cackling, blood-thirsty,
            robust Jenny &quot;Ma&quot; Grier (Jane Darwell). Each of the vengeful members
            of the cold-blooded posse-mob were superbly characterized, as the
            vigilante group rode off. At  Ox-Bow Valley, they came upon three
            sleeping men with 50 head of cattle. They captured the men, including
            stoic, defiant Mexican hired hand Juan Martinez (Anthony Quinn) (identified
            as a wanted criminal named Francisco Morez) who at first feigned
            not speaking English, and  senile, feeble-minded old man Alva Hardwick
            (Francis Ford, director John Ford's older brother). The third man
            was rancher Donald Martin (Dana Andrews) who claimed he bought the
            herd from Kincaid but had no bill of sale. It was impulsively assumed
            that he was a cattle rustler. Martinez had Kincaid's gun, which he
            said he found on the road. The mob conducted a quick trial (without
            due process) of the three innocent men despite only vague circumstantial
             evidence and pleas for justice and reason. Carter and
            Croft unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the dawn lynching of the
            three innocent men for alleged murder and cattle rustling (the vote
            among the 28 jurors was 21/7 in favor of hanging, instead of a hearing
            and trial in town). Shortly later, the group met up with the shocked
            Sheriff, who had just apprehended the real rustlers, and revealed
            that Kincaid was only wounded - and that they &quot;caught the fellas
            who shot him too.&quot; In the film's epilogue set back in the town's saloon, Carter read the farewell
            words of Martin in a letter (a strong indictment of vigilante lawlessness)
              that he had written to his wife and two young children before the
            lynching. A collection was taken for Martin's widow, and the two
            drifters rode off after promising to deliver the letter.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Phantom of the Opera (1943),</b> 92 minutes, D:
              Arthur Lubin<br />
        Many versions of the 'Grand Guignol Phantom' tale, based upon
        the 1910 novel by Gaston Leroux, have stretched from Universal's silent
        classic <i>The Phantom of the Opera (1925) </i>with Lon Chaney and Mary
        Philbin<i>, </i> to
            this lavish Technicolored 1943 remake of the dramatic horror-thriller,
        to the more recent <i>The
            Phantom of the Opera (2004)</i> from director Joel Schumacher, starring
            Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler. The 1943 film was notable for being
            the first film to feature popular  star and tenor Nelson Eddy as
            the opera-singing hero after leaving MGM and his long-standing motion
            picture partnership with actress Jeanette MacDonald. It also won
            two Oscars: Best Color Cinematography and Best Color Art Direction.
            In the plot set at the Paris Opera House, the violinist in the opera's
            orchestra Erique Claudin (Claude Rains) had been anonymously funding
            voice lessons for three years for soprano opera singer Christine
            DuBois (Susanna Foster), whom he secretly worshipped. Due to the
            paralysis of part of his left hand, Erique was dismissed after twenty
            years of service by the opera's conductor Signor Ferretti (Leo Carrillo),
            and faced eviction from his apartment by his landlady. To raise money,
            Erique decided to sell a piano concerto (&quot;Lullaby
            of the Bells&quot;) he had written, and  mistakenly accused  music
            publisher Maurice Pleyel (Miles Mander) of stealing his concerto.
            During a fit of manic rage, Erique strangled Pleyel  
            to death, after which etching acid was tossed into his face
            by Pleyel's mistress-assistant Georgette (Renee Carson), horribly
            disfiguring him. From then on, Erique took refuge in the cellars
            and catacombs underneath the Opera House as a masked, caped figure.
            Christine found herself in the middle of a major love triangle involving
            three rival suitors: police Inspector Raoul Daubert (Edgar Barrier),
            baritone opera star Anatole Garron (Nelson Eddy), her true love,
            and Erique. Shortly later, stagehands at the Opera began speaking
            about the haunted Opera House that was being plagued by mysterious
            accidents and blackmailing threats, including written demands that
            Christine be promoted to the lead role to replace vain prima donna-diva
            Madame Biancarolli (Jane Farrar). Understudy Christine received a
            big career break after Biancarolli was first drugged by Erique to
            incapacitate her. Later, the diva was visited by the &quot;Phantom&quot; in
            her dressing room, where she unmasked the Phantom before she and
            her maid were strangled. Anatole vainly pursued after the Phantom
            above the opera stage, but afterwards was blamed for Biancarolli's
            murder. To draw the Phantom out, Inspector Daubert proposed to have
            another singer, Mme. Lorenzi (Niki Andre), replace Christine during
            an opera performance. In anger and to further terrorize the Opera
            House during the performance, Erique sawed through a heavy chain
            holding the chamber's massive chandelier, causing it to crash down
            upon the orchestra members in the auditorium. During the chaos, Erique
            absconded with Christine and brought her to his underground hideaway.
            After the Phantom expressed his love for Christine, the two heard
            the distant playing of Erique's piano concerto during the end of
            the opera show. Delighted, Erique began to play along with the piece
            on his piano, alerting both Anatole and the Inspector Raoul to the
            location of his whereabouts. Meanwhile, Christine ripped off Erique's
            mask - to reveal his disfigurement, at the moment that she was being
            rescued and saved. Pistol shots echoed throughout the subterranean
            lair, causing instability in the catacomb's ancient walls, and a
            major cave-in. Erique was buried alive and crushed to death in the
            falling debris, while Christine was saved just in time. In the conclusion,
            Christine decided to forsake both of her suitors-rescuers in favor
            of pursuing her singing career for her adoring Parisian public </font></p>

                The 7th Victim)</b>, 71 minutes, D: Mark Robson<br />
        Horror master and RKO film producer Val Lewton was responsible for this
        creepy, doom-laden, noirish and Gothic thriller (Mark Robson's debut
        film), a low-budget black and white B-film (with a lesbian subtext) with
         the tagline: &quot;SLAVE to SATAN!&quot; It was a precursor to Roman
        Polanski's <i><a href="rosem.html">Rosemary's
        Baby (1968)</a></i>, and even had a <i>Psycho</i>-like shower sequence. In the enigmatic story,
        naive, orphaned young private school student Mary Gibson (Kim Hunter
        in her film debut) learned from convent nuns in her upstate NY Catholic
        school, Miss Highcliff's, that her older sister Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Gibson
        (Jean Brooks), the owner of La Sagesse, a successful cosmetics factory,
        had been missing for a number of months (and was not paying Mary's tuition).
        During a search in New York's Greenwich Village, she located errant
        Jackie's NYC apartment (a bare room with a chair and hangman's noose)
        above Dante's (an Italian restaurant), and learned that wealthy NY lawyer
        Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont) who was paying the rent - was her brother-in-law
        after a secret marriage to Jackie (although it had failed). [The film
        took a strange turn when Mary and Gregory fell in love with each other.]
        They also met a mysterious physician and psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd
        (Tom Conway), who had treated Jacqueline for depression. According
        to him, his pale and fragile patient had become obsessed with death and
        despair. In truth, Dr. Judd knew Jackie's location and  was
         romancing her on the side. He belonged
         to an underground coven of witches, a deadly cult
         of diabolic Satanic worshippers called The Palladists. Shockingly, Jackie
        had given up her business and her soul to the possessed devil cultists.
         She found herself kidnapped and in their imprisoning grip, and condemned
         to die if she left the group. They wished to keep her from revealing
         her association with them by encouraging
         her to commit suicide (as the 7th departing victim!), or by assassinating
         her. Fearing for her life, Jacqueline had gone into hiding. In the conclusion,  she
         escaped a suspenseful, lethal stalking

        the acquaintance of consumptive and terminally-ill prostitute Mimi
         (Elizabeth Russell), a neighbor in her bleak rooming house, before entering
         her own empty apartment (# 7) and hanging herself (offscreen) in the
         surprise ending. Simultaneously, Mimi stepped out into the street for
         one last night of laughing and dancing. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
            One of Alfred Hitchcock's most-suspenseful works (and his personal
            favorite) was based on a script by Thornton Wilder. The opening sequence
            identified the chilling, twisted, devious homicidal character of
            Uncle Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotten) - the &quot;Merry Widow Murderer&quot; -
            evil personified from the very first scenes, as he fled from Philadelphia
             after committing a third murder of a rich widow. He suspected that
            his apprehension by police was imminent, and schemed to drop out
            of sight by visiting his adoring, middle-class relatives, including
            his unsuspecting, spinsterish older sister Mrs. Joseph (Emma) Newton
            (Patricia Collinge) in California. There were instances of telepathic
            twin-ness similarities and affinities between the congenial and suave
            Uncle Charlie and his symbiotic namesake - his young favorite niece  &quot;Charlie&quot; (Charlotte)
            Newton (Teresa Wright) who was named for the uncle she idolized.
            At first, young Charlie was fascinated by her uncle's wit, urbane
            and worldly sophistication - but then a &quot;shadow of a doubt&quot; slowly
            began to emerge. Charlie rushed to the town's library
            just before it closed at nine pm, to see the contents of an article
            that Uncle Charlie had suspiciously cut out of her father's newspaper.
            In the reading room, she reacted dramatically -- her eyes widened
            as she found damning evidence that her Uncle was the &quot;Merry
            Widow Murderer -- Strangler of Three Rich Women&quot; -
            and that he was the object of a nationwide search. She also put two-and-two
            together - the initials engraved on the back of an emerald ring given
            as a gift to her by Uncle Charlie matched the initials of the murderer's
            third victim. In a  key dinner table speech,
            a contemptuous, misogynistic monologue was delivered by Uncle Charlie
            - about his hatred for rich, lazily fat, detestable, middle-aged
            widows. As she approached closer to him and learned the truth,
        she realized that he was aware of her knowledge and suspicions. She had
            to decide whether she should reveal her findings to the authorities
        or protect her family. After her confrontation
        in a seedy bar with her uncle, she reluctantly agreed to not say anything
        if he promised to leave town soon, to avoid any scandal and to protect
        her mother from knowing that her younger brother was a murderer. There
        were two failed 'murder' attempts to kill young Charlie - a tampered-with
        broken step on the back stairs, and a malfunctioning garage door paired
        with carbon monoxide poisoning. In the exciting conclusion
          as Uncle Charlie was departing on the train for San Francisco (on the
          same train as widowed Mrs. Potter (Frances Carson), his next victim),
          he struggled between train-cars with young Charlie. She reversed positions
          with him, upset his balance and pushed him away - he fell headlong
          into the path of an oncoming, speeding train on an adjacent track. </font></p></td>

              D: Henry King<br />
            This dramatic and reverent film with a religious theme and expressive
            B/W Cinematography was adapted from the 1941 novel by Franz Werfel,
            retelling a story based upon a real-life person and event beginning
            in 1858. In the prologue, a quote appeared as a title card: &quot;This
            is the story of Bernadette Soubirous who lived in Lourdes, a village
            in southern France close to the Spanish border. For
            those who believe in God, no explanation is necessary. For those
            who do not believe, no explanation will suffice.&quot; The title
            character was a young 19th century illiterate, simple-minded, asthmatic
            French peasant girl Bernadette Soubirous (Jennifer Jones (aka Phyllis
            Isley), in her first starring role for which she won the Best Actress
            Academy Award). She attended a convent school run by
            severe and devout Sister Marie Therese Vauzous (Gladys Cooper). One
            day in a grotto at the provincial French village of Lourdes, Bernadette
            had a glowing, rapturous and bright vision of a beautiful &quot;Lady&quot; dressed
            in white, interpreted by villagers to be the Blessed Virgin Mary
            (Linda Darnell). The &quot;Lady&quot; instructed
            her to return to the grotto daily for 15 days in succession. The
            film centered around all the various reactions to Bernadette's chosen-by-God
            vision and her daily pilgrimage, mostly skepticism, blasphemy, criticism,
            and ridicule, although there were some early believers. A spring
            with waters to heal the sick and disabled appeared suddenly and inexplicably
            at the site of her miraculous vision where she had been instructed
            to dig in the earth and rub mud over herself. Arrogant town elder
            and wicked Imperial Prosecutor Vital Dutour (Vincent Price) thought
            she was superstitious and fraudulent and making up her story, and
            became obsessed with committing her to an asylum. Faithful Bernadette
            steadfastly refused to recant her story and held fast to her beliefs.
            The discovery of the miraculous healing waters in the holy grotto
            helped many to believe in the naive girl's vision, and crowds began
            to accompany her. Believing pilgrims flocked to the healing spring
            to bathe in its Holy Water, at first prohibited by town politicians
            such as the Mayor of Lourdes Alphonse Lacade (Aubrey Mather), but
            then hypocritically encouraged. After a few years, 20 year-old Bernadette
            was accepted into the Convent of the Sisters of Nevers, now named
            Sister Marie Bernarde and under the watchful eye of her previous
            hard and resentful taskmaster Sister Vauzous. For many years, mortally-ill
            Bernadette without complaint suffered with a horrible leg tumor and
            incurable tuberculosis of the bone and steadily grew weaker, while
            still enduring questioning from the Episcopalian Commission. However,
            she remained steadfast in her beliefs. In the film's conclusion on
            her deathbed, Bernadette raised her head from the pillow and experienced
            a final visitation from the Virgin Mary who held out her arms, and
            smiled. Bernadette responded: &quot;I
            love you! I love you! Holy Mary, Mother of God. Pray for me.&quot; After
            her death, Dean of Lourdes Father Peyramale (Charles Bickford) stated
            she was now in a state of grace: (&quot;You
            are now in Heaven and on Earth. Your life begins, O Bernadette&quot;).
            Superimposed bells began to peal from the church tower, and there
            was a chorus of &quot;Hallelujahs.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

              Herman Shumlin<br />
            This propagandistic, anti-isolationist war-time drama expressed
            the dangers and evils of Fascist thought. It was one of the best
            and well-made of all the anti-Nazi films of the war years. It was
            based on Lillian Hellman's Broadway play, and scripted by Dashiell
            Hammett. In the plot, German-born engineer Kurt Muller (Paul Lukas
            who won a Best Actor award, defeating Humphrey Bogart in <i>Casablanca
            (1942)</i>), a European Resistance underground leader, was forced
            to flee from Nazi Germany just prior to Pearl Harbor in order to
            find safe refuge in America. After 18 years in Europe, he and his
            American-born wife Sara (Bette Davis) and their three young children
            crossed the border from Mexico, and moved in with her brother David
            Farrelly (Donald Woods) and mother Fanny Farrelly (Lucile Watson),
            widow of a Supreme Court Justice in Washington D.C. Refusing to
            remain silent, Kurt explained to them the true nature and threat
            of the Nazis (and to the American public in a bit of propagandizing).
            He was confronted with the threat of being betrayed or blackmailed
            to Gestapo Third Reich agents (in the German Embassy) by other boarders
            in the home, especially treacherous blackmailing spy Teck de Brancovis
            (George Coulouris), an exiled Rumanian count who had married Marthe
            de Brancovis (Geraldine Fitzgerald), one of the Farrelly's daughters.
            Teck suspected that Kurt was a leader of the anti-Nazi underground
            after snooping in his locked briefcase. During a confrontation, Kurt
            cold-bloodedly shot Teck dead, and then explained to his wife Sara
            that it was a justifiable homicide before fleeing. In the conclusion,
            the oldest Muller son Joshua (Donald Buka) was already planning to
            return to Europe to fight Nazis with his father and/or attempt a
            rescue. </font></p></td>
