              minutes, D: Ridley Scott<br />
            Director Ridley Scott's moody futuristic, sci-fi noirish action-thriller
            featured  stunning, visually-dazzling effects and a brooding
            atmosphere. It was based on the 1968 novel <em>Do Androids
            Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> by Philip K. Dick, and told about
            a hard-boiled detective hunting near-human &quot;replicants.&quot; A
            second director's cut version was released in 1992 - it removed Deckard's
            voice-over narration, added a dream sequence (a unicorn reverie),
            and edited out the film's happy ending. A sequel followed:  <i>Blade
            Runner 2049 (2017)</i>. In a totalitarian,
            decaying 21st century Los Angeles (November, 2019), jaded, semi-retired,
            Philip Marlowe-style ex-cop Rick Deckard (Harrison
            Ford), known as a &quot;blade runner,&quot; was forced out of retirement.
            He was hired by his  old boss, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) to hunt down
            and eliminate (or 'retire') four synthetic  &quot;replicants&quot; -
            genetically engineered super-humanoid robots built by the Tyrell
            Corporation and their designer Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). The
            four highly-advanced Nexus 6 replicants included: 'pleasure model'-prostitute
            Pris (Daryl Hannah), the advanced, superhuman and highly intelligent
            leader Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), trained assassin Zhora (Joanna Cassidy),
            and Leon Kowalski (Brion James). They had illegally come to Earth
            from an Off-world colony where they were used as slave laborers.
            With a built-in, shortened life span of only four years, the androids
            had mutinied and escaped in order to confront the individual who
            designed them, Dr. Tyrell. At the Tyrell Corp.'s headquarters, Deckard
            met Tyrell's personal assistant,  beautiful Rachael (Sean Young),
            a typical <em>femme fatale</em>. Using Rachael as a test subject
            with a device known as a Voight-Kampff (VK) analyzer, Deckard tested
            her and discovered that she was a bio-engineered, replicant-android
            herself. She was a unique experimental Replicant who had been given
            implanted memories, and wasn't entirely aware of her true identity.
            (Deckard was conflicted about Rachael after learning that she was
            also to be eliminated, after he fell in love with her.) Deckard began
            eliminating the replicants one-by-one, first Zhora (who he found
            posing as an exotic dancer named Miss Salom&eacute;),
              and then Leon. Meanwhile,  Pris (Roy's lover) was
              ingratiating herself with J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) -
            a dying inventor (who designed lifelike toys and dolls) and also
            functioned as a Tyrell Corporation genetic designer. Her manipulative
            goal was to get close to Tyrell and murder him. Roy was successful
            in infiltrating into Tyrell's penthouse home with Sebastian, and
            demanded that his &quot;father&quot; -
            or creator extend his short lifespan. When denied, the despondent
            Roy first kissed Tyrell, but then crushed his skull by poking 
              his thumbs through Tyrell's eyes - and then killed Sebastian. Afterwards,
              Deckard confronted both Pris and Roy at Sebastian's place, and
              eliminated both of them. It was ironic that Deckard was saved from
              falling to his death from the rooftop, followed by Roy's very dramatic
              and moving death - he was saddened that with his impending premature
              death, all of his acquired memories would be lost &quot;like
              tears in rain.&quot; As the film concluded, blade-runner Deckard
              realized the heroic struggle of the androids
              against an inhumane system - and he allowed Rachael to live - and
              learned that she had no termination date. [Note: There were numerous
            hints throughout the film that Deckard himself was a replicant.] </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Diner (1982), </b>110 minutes, D: Barry Levinson<br />
            Writer/director Barry Levinson's influential period comedy film and
            character study of male friendship was a classic episodic rites-of-passage
            film set in the late 50s that centered around a Baltimore, Maryland
            diner, where six Jewish male buddies in their twenties hung out for
            six days between Christmas and New Years; the ensemble comedy's taglines
            expressed the film's theme: &quot;What they wanted most wasn't on
            the menu&quot; and &quot;Suddenly, life was more than french fries,
          gravy, and girls.&quot; Many of the scenes in the film (over an extended
              Christmas holiday period in 1959) were held at the Fells Point
              Diner between a group of six post high-school graduate male friends
              - featuring their many fast-paced, late night, often mindless,
              guy-talk discussions (with overlapping dialogue, both scripted
              and improvisational). An approaching marriage for one member of
              the group brought the confused, struggling, chauvinistic group
              together at the diner for more eating and drinking, arguing, and
              talking  about sex, sports trivia, the direction of their lives,
          and 45 rpm records. The six guys were introduced (in the order of their
            appearance):  indebted
          compulsive gambler, aspiring law student at the Univ. of Baltimore
          and ladies man Robert &quot;Boogie&quot; Sheftell (Mickey Rourke) who
          worked days in a beauty parlor, irresponsible, troubled, rebellious,
          and often-drunken rich trust-fund kid and college drop-out Timothy &quot;Fen&quot; Fenwick,
          Jr. (Kevin Bacon), TV and appliances store clerk Laurence &quot;Shrevie&quot; Schreiber
          (Daniel Stern) who was unhappily-married to Beth (Ellen Barkin in her
          screen debut), annoying, rambling and wisecracking Modell (Paul Reiser)
          and about-to-be-married nervous fiancee Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Simmons
          (Steve Guttenberg).  The sixth member of their gang at the train station:
          Masters in Business graduate student William &quot;Billy&quot; Howard
          (Timothy Daly) who was on a holiday break; he arrived in town to attend
          Eddie's New Years Eve marriage to his off-screen fiancee Elyse (to
          serve as Best Man), and to hook up with his unmarried girlfriend Barbara
          Kohler (Kathryn Dowling) who worked in the local TV station. On a budget
            of $5 million, it made less than $15 million, and lost its sole Academy
          Award nomination (Best Original Screenplay). </font></p></td>

            Director Steven Spielberg's  massively popular, widely appealing,
            feel-good sci-fi fantasy became a cultural phenomenon in the early
            80s - and  one of the most popular and highest-grossing
            movies of all time. Its story was about a kind-hearted, cute alien
            living with a suburban family, known as E.T. The harmless alien botanist
            from outer space had been left behind and stranded on Earth. The
            lovable extra-terrestrial was lured by Halloween candy (Reese's Pieces),
            befriended by a young boy (Henry Thomas), and protected from authoritarian
            adults and menacing scientists who wanted to dissect and study the
            creature. The curious alien eventually found his way back home, with
            aid from children, to his returning spaceship.</font></p>        </td>

              a rubber entrepreneur in turn-of-the-century Peru. His quixotic

              Martin Scorsese<br />
            Scorsese's original, under-appreciated dark comedy - a stark contrast
            to his own <em><a href="taxi.html">Taxi Driver (1976)</a></em>, was
            about the bizarre relationship between stardom, the cult of celebrity,
            and violence-prone wannabe obsessed fans. Scorsese and
            screenwriter Paul Zimmerman managed to pull off a story that was
            not only chilling and spooky, but geniunely funny, yet the film was
            so far ahead of its time that it flopped at the box-office upon release.
            It was similar to Elia Kazan's <em><a href="faceinthecrowd.html">A
          Face in the Crowd (1957)</a></em>. The main character was a
          wimpy, aspiring stand-up comedian named Rupert Pupkin (Robert
          De Niro in his fourth film with Scorsese) - a
          man in his mid-30's who still lived with his mother (only heard off-screen). The
          untalented and self-deluded Rupert worshipped fame and was determined
          to become a celebrity. He was totally obsessed with late-night talk
          show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis, playing the role absolutely
          straight in his best dramatic role ever), a Johnny Carson-esque character
              (the part was originally written for Johnny Carson), and stalked
              his 'love' object at his show. He brazenly appeared unannounced
              at Langford's country estate with an embarrassed date-friend Rita
              (Diahnne Abbott, De Niro's wife at the time). Later, with the help
              of an equally deranged, amorous fan and talk-show groupie Masha
              (Sandra Bernhard, who won Best Supporting Actress with the National
              Society of Film Critics), Rupert kidnapped Langford and demanded
              as ransom that he get to do the opening monologue one night on
              Langford's show, and be named the new &quot;King of
        Comedy.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Koyaanisqatsi (1982)</strong>, 87 minutes,
              D: Godfrey Reggio <br />
            The powerful, unconventional, experimental and provocative script-less,
            actor-less, and dialogue-less film (except for the chanting of Hopi
            prophecy at the end) was from director Godfrey Reggio - his first
            attempt at a feature-length narrative film. One of the title's meanings
            was: &quot;A state of life that calls for another way of living.&quot; The
            Hopi Prophecies chanted in the film were translated in a final title
            card, warning: &quot;If we dig precious things from the land, we
            will invite disaster.&quot; Considered both revolutionary and pretentious,
            this unique and hypnotic work with incredible, expert time-lapse
            photography was insightful about humankind and our relationship to
            nature, and explored the world in ways we usually never see due to
            our limited perceptions. The title was taken from a Hopi Indian word,
            meaning, among other things: &quot;Life
            (a world) out of balance.&quot; This multimedia film, supported
            by both Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas - a well-constructed
            sequence of music-laced scenes, illustrated the collision of the
            natural world with the hustle and bustle of urban, technological
            life and civilization. <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> featured
            images and scenes that were truly haunting and lingering long after
            the film was over, like the empty shells of the Pruitt-Igoe housing
            in St. Louis, the alternating shots between satellite photos of human
            cities and the landscapes of micro-chip circuitry, and the final
            shot of a V2 rocket exploding, as the camera followed the free-fall
            of a charred chunk to the ground. Clouds over the Grand Canyon appeared
            as roiling waves of a white ocean, or as shadows over the sides of
             towering NYC skyscrapers, and city streets with streaks of brake
            lights from commuter's vehicles looked like blood vessels in the
            circulatory system. Philip Glass' stunningly creative, minimalist
            score played as large a part as the cinematography (by Ron Fricke),
            and beautifully complemented this artistic film. It was followed
            by two sequels in a <em>Qatsi</em> trilogy,
            of sorts: the equally powerful <em>Powaqqatsi (1988) </em>(life in
            transformation) focusing on Third World countries, and the lesser <em>Naqoyqatsi
        (2003)</em> (life as war).</font></p>          </td>

              D: Taylor Hackford<br />
              Director Taylor Hackford's and Paramount's R-rated blockbuster
              (chick-flick) and crowd-pleasing romantic drama was about the training
              of a US Navy Aviation officer candidate, and his on-again/off-again
              romantic relationship with a local townie, one of the 'Puget Debs'
        - who worked at a paper factory and helped to reveal his inner &quot;gentleman.&quot;
        Aloof, cynical, arrogant, cocky Navy cadet trainee Zack Mayo (Richard
        Gere) started  his 13-week training at Aviation Officer Candidate
        School (AOCS) in Port Rainier, located on the Puget Sound in Washington
        state. In a flashback, during his childhood, Zack had been  brought
              up unwanted by his boozing, hedonistic, military seaman father
              Byron Mayo (Robert Loggia) in the Philippines after his abandoned
        mother committed suicide. No-nonsense and tough drill Marine Gunnery
        Sgt. Emil Foley (Oscar-winning Louis Gossett, Jr.) confronted the
              new recruits with a series of insults as they lined up in front
        of him before their 13 week training program. The raw, tattooed, long-haired
        recruit Zack, with a chip on his shoulder, was singled out for special
        abusive treatment. At a sponsored officer's dance, a romance developed
        between Zack and headstrong, husky-voiced, Polish, local paper factory
        working girl Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger), one of the local 'Puget Debs'
            or &quot;townies&quot;
        who dreamt of marrying a naval officer. Sgt. Foley punished Zack and
        reprimanded him for not being a team player - after discovering that
        he was running a contraband side business of selling shined shoes and
        belt buckles. During a weekend of punishment, Zack was encouraged by
        Foley to self-issue a DOR (Drop Out on Request) to be removed, but he
        refused (&quot;I got nowhere else to go! I got nowhere else to g... I
        ain't got nothin' else. I got nothin' else&quot;). Paula and Zack experienced
        an up-and-down relationship - she challenged him for not showing a commitment,
        and they became more deeply involved with an erotic,
        realistic and sexually explicit nude love scene. Zack's  All-American
        boyish buddy from Oklahoma, Sid Worley (David Keith) had also established
        a romantic relationship with Paula's manipulative work friend Lynette
        Pomeroy (Lisa Blount), who was dropping hints that she was pregnant;
        impulsively, Sid decided to DOR from the naval aviation program after
        11 weeks. He proceeded to Lynette's house to propose to her with an engagement
        ring, and suggested that they move back to Oklahoma. To his surprise,
        Lynette cruelly rejected his romantic invitation - she also told Sid
        that she wasn't pregnant and that their relationship was over because
        she really wanted to marry a naval aviator. Tragically, Zack discovered
        the dead body of Sid (in the nude in the Tides Inn Motel bathroom),
        where he had committed suicide by hanging after his failed relationship
        with Lynette. Zack was utterly frustrated with the death of Sid,
        and was tempted to also DOR from the base. A bruising,
        ball-busting unofficial martial-arts bout with Sgt. Foley (&quot;Let's
        see what ya got&quot;)  changed Zack's mind about requesting a DOR. In
         the rousing, overly-sentimental, slightly-cheesy tearjerking finale
        (a wish-fulfillment <i>Cinderella</i> conclusion), graduate-trainee Ensign
        Zack Mayo (in his neatly-pressed naval dress whites after being commissioned)
        came up to a surprised Paula at her factory workplace.  He swooped her
        up into his arms with kisses, and carried her away to the exit, as her
        co-workers applauded - to the tune of the Oscar-winning &quot;Up Where
        We Belong.&quot; </font></p></td>

            Director Tobe Hooper (who was better known for his
            cult horror classic <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)</em>)
            created this memorable supernatural horror film with co-producer/co-writer
            Steven Spielberg. This was Spielberg's first smash hit as a co-producer,
            paired with Frank Marshall (who later produced <em><a href="whof.html">Who
          Framed Roger Rabbit? (1988)</a></em>). It was
          released at the same time as another suburban tale with otherworldly
          visitors: <em><a href="etth.html">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)</a></em> and
          could also be interpreted as a threatening, scarier version of director
          Spielberg's pre-E.T. film: <em><a href="clos.html">Close Encounters
          of the Third Kind (1977)</a></em>. Compared to both films, <em>Poltergeist</em> was
          the dark flip side of alien encounters. Its classic 'haunted house
          ghost story' was fascinating to watch, with extraordinary special effects
          created by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic team, from a screenplay
          by Spielberg, Michael Grais, and Mark Victor. The famous poster
          reflected one of the more memorable, spookier moments of the film,
          with young 5 year-old Carole Anne (Heather O'Rourke) pressed against
          a television showing nothing but white noise, telling everyone:
		   &quot;They're <em>here</em>.&quot; There
          were two, less successful sequels in subsequent years: <em>Poltergeist
          II: The Other Side (1986)</em> and <em>Poltergeist III (1988)</em>.
          Many filmgoers were intrigued by the seemingly-tragic legacy of the
          film, with the unexpected deaths of star Dominique Dunne (in her last
          film role before her tragic murder by her live-in boyfriend) and O'Rourke
          (who died six years later just before the second sequel's release).
          In the basically-simple plot, two Southern California suburbanites:
          Diane and Steve Freeling (JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson) were
          living in the newly-built Cuesta Verde housing development or subdivision,
          in their dream home. They had three children: teenaged older daughter
          Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins) and young Carol Anne
          (Heather O'Rourke). Many strange and extra-ordinary events began to
          occur - some of them threatening, including a blank TV screen, the
          death of a pet bird, unexplainable stacked kitchen table chairs and
          bending silverware, a gnarled backyard tree that came to life, and
          later, Robbie's terrorizing favorite clown doll. The 'ghostly' inhabitants
          of the house turned ominous when Carol Anne was kidnapped through a
          portal in her bedroom closet and taken into a different dimension.
          College parapsychologists:  Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight),
          Ryan (Richard Lawson), and Marty (Martin Casella) were consulted and
          judged the phenomena as the result of a poltergeist. A spiritual medium
          named Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) was also brought into the
          home to investigate. After Carol Anne (and Robbie) were rescued from
          the Beast, it was ascertained that the Cuesta Verde development was
          built on the location of a cemetery that had <i>not</i> been relocated
          as promised. (Coffins with skeletons were unearthed in the Freeling's
          muddy backyard during a rainstorm.) The film ended with the implosion
          of the Freeling house as it was taken into the portal, as the family
          escaped to a motel for the night. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Sydney Pollack<br />
            Actor/director Sydney Pollack's modern-day, appealing classic Hollywood
              romantic comedy featured witty dialogue in its story about
              a NYC actor who was forced to cross-dress to find employment. [Note:
              Star Dustin Hoffman successfully prepared for the role by dressing
              in drag and convincingly fooling others, and he welcomed the chance
              to lampoon his own acting reputation as &quot;difficult.&quot;]
              Desperate out-of-work, contentious, stubborn stage actor Michael
              Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman), often considered temperamental, troublesome
              and sexist by his exasperated agent George Fields (director Pollack),
              could only find part-time jobs (waiting tables in a restaurant).
              His roommate was his best friend Jeff Slater (Bill Murray), an
              eccentric playwright, who also had money problems. After
              his insecure and neurotic girlfriend Sandy Lester (Teri Garr) was
              rejected for a role in the daytime TV soap opera <i>Southwest General</i>
              (a parody of <i>General Hospital</i>), Michael tried out by disguising
               himself as his own cross-dressing alter-ego named 'Dorothy
              Michaels' - a middle-aged feminist with padding. He  
              won the part of Emily Kimberley - a no-nonsense, spunky, hospital
              administrator. He had to work with the detestable sexist director
              Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman) and producer Rita Marshall (Doris
              Beack). By winning the role, he had accomplished his goal of proving
              both George and Jeff wrong about his abilities - and was also raising
               funds of $8,000  to help finance Jeff's latest play (that
              would provide lead roles   for Michael and
              Sandy). Soon, his role made the show  a
              tremendous hit, but his life became even more complicated. While
              pursued by lecherous, long-time aging lead actor John Van Horn
              (George Gaynes) who was playing the part of Dr. Brewster, the disguised
              Michael became close to sweet fellow co-star actress Julie Nichols
              (Jessica Lange) who was playing a nurse - Ron's mistreated girlfriend,
              and soon secretly fell in love with her. Meanwhile, Julie's interested
              widowed father Les (Charles Durning) also fell for her-him. It
              was a difficult balancing act for Michael to show his affection
              for Julie as her confidante (without divulging his true identity
              as a man or being interpreted as a lesbian), and without ruining
              his friendship with Sandy. In the film's classic reveal sequence
              on the live TV show, Dorothy ad-libbed as she surprised everyone
              by removing her wig and wove a story about how she was actually
              Edward, Emily's twin brother who took her place to avenge her.
              In the film's conclusion, Julie slowly came around to forgive Michael
              (who had deceived her), and told him that she was really missing
               Dorothy's company. Michael confessed to Julie about the lesson
              he had learned: &quot;I
            was a better man with you, as a woman, than I ever was with a woman,
            as a man.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Verdict (1982)</b>, 129 minutes, D: Sidney Lumet<br />
            Alcoholic, ambulance-chasing, personal injury lawyer Frank Galvin
            (Paul Newman) in Boston, disgraced (when framed for jury tampering)
            and with a reputation for losing, was forced to acquire business
            by attending funeral services and handing out business cards to bereaved
            family membres. Then, his friend and semi-retired mentor Mickey Morrissey
            (Jack Warden) referred him to a devastating hospital case - that
            would soon produce a medical malpractice lawsuit. A pregnant woman
            became comatose and was left in a vegetative state following delivery
            at a Boston Archdiocese hospital. In the most promising case of his
            career and to atone for his drunken past, Galvin (while struggling
            to stay sober) was challenged to prove that Dr. Towler (Wesley Addy)
            had administered the wrong anesthesia. It was assumed that the family
            (and defense) would accept a huge settlement of $210,000 from the
            hospital's head Bishop Brophy (Edward Binns), or from slick defense
            attorney Ed Concannon (James Mason). But Galvin, in a stunning reversal,
            refused to settle out of court and set about to take the case for
          the plaintiffs, in the presence of presiding Judge Hoyle (Milo O'Shea).  During
          the trial, Galvin was immediately confronted by sneaky tactics from
          Concannon's law firm: unscrupulous methods that removed a key medical
          witness, the undermining of a substitute witness' testimony, the planting
          of fellow bar-patron Laura Fischer (Charlotte Rampling) from the competing
          law firm as his love-making partner - in order to betray him, and cronyism
              with Judge Hoyle. Dr. Towler testified that he had done nothing
              improper or negligent, and had administered the proper drug for
              a patient that reportedly hadn't eaten for nine hours. Then, Galvin
              called a surprise witness, nurse Kaitlin Costello (Lindsay Crouse),
              to testify that Towler had ordered her to change the admitting
              records about the time interval from &quot;1 hour&quot; to &quot;9
              hours&quot; - after he had made a fatal error by using the wrong
              anesthesia. She revealed a photocopy of the original admitting
              room form, showing the number &quot;1&quot; to the stunned court.
              Concannon conspired with the Judge to declare the nurse's testimony
              as inadmissable. In the conclusion, Galvin presented a subdued
              but convincing closing summation-argument to the courtroom jury: &quot;So
              much of the time, we're just lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us
              what is right. Tell us what is true.' I mean there is no justice.
              The rich win. The poor are powerless. We become tired of hearing
              people lie. And after a time we become dead, a little dead. We
              think of ourselves as victims, and we become victims. We become,
              we become weak. We doubt ourselves. We doubt our beliefs. We doubt
              our institutions, and we doubt the law. But today, you are the
              law. You are the law, not some book, not the lawyers, not a marble
              statue, or the trappings of the court. See, those are just symbols
              of our desire to be just. They are, they are, in fact, a prayer,
              I mean a fervent and a frightened prayer. In my religion, they
              say, 'Act as if you had faith. Faith will be given to you.' If-if
              we are to have faith in justice, we need only to believe in ourselves
              and act with justice. See, I believe there is justice in our hearts.&quot; The
              jury returned their decision in favor of Galvin's clients (the
              plaintiffs), thereby disregarding the judge's instructions to ignore
              the nurse's testimony. The jury foreman was told that they could
          legally award a greater amount than originally asked for. </font></p>        </td>

              115 minutes, D: Peter Weir<br />
              Director Peter Weir's tale of political upheaval, divergent
              cultures, loyalty, betrayal, ambition, and morality was embedded
              in a love story. The first overseas assignment of shallow yet ambitious
              Australian journalist Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson) was in Indonesia
              in 1965. Hamilton was 'adopted' by dwarfish Eurasian photographer
              Billy Kwan (Oscar-winning, cross-gendered Linda Hunt) and introduced
              to British consular official Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver) with
              whom he promptly fell in love. She gave him secret information
              regarding an arms shipment to the Communists so that they could
              escape the predicted war together, but Hamilton unwisely used the
              information for an exclusive story and put their lives in severe
              jeopardy. </font></p></td>
