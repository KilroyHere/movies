                and the Beast)</strong>, 96 minutes, D: Jean Cocteau<br />
                This fanciful and enchanting story has been remade many times,
                both as short silent and talkie versions, and most memorably
                as Disney's animated film in 1991. Writer/director/painter-poet
                Jean Cocteau produced this as his first feature film, and asked
                the audience as the film started: &quot;I
                ask of you a little . . . childlike simplicity.&quot; It was
                adapted from a classic 1757 fairy tale by French novelist Jeanne-Marie
                Le Prince de Beaumont, the story of how commoner Belle/Beauty
                (Josette Day) saved her father (Marcel Andr&eacute;) by
                giving herself to a repulsive Bete/Beast (Jean Marais). The major
                theme  was finding beauty
                beneath outward appearances, told with some obvious Freudian
                symbolism and haunting, surreal and atmospheric images. The magical
                and visually-beautiful film began with an introduction to the
                four siblings of a family now destitute due to the failure of
                their father's merchant shipping business. There were two wasteful,
                spoiled, haughty, evil and vain sisters: Ad&eacute;la&iuml;de
                (Nane Germon) and F&eacute;licie (Mila Par&eacute;ly), and the
                hard-working, enslaved and devoted Belle. The fourth sibling
                was their lazy wastrel brother Ludovic (Michel Auclair), who
                protectively sheltered Belle from the romantic pursuits of his
                handsome friend - the shallow scoundrel Avenant (also Jean Marais).
                One dark night in the forest when returning home after a failed
                business trip, the father was taken prisoner in an extravagant
                and magical palace castle by the resident angry and grotesque
                half-man, half-Bete - for the crime of taking one rose bush blossom.
                He was given the choice within three days of dying himself, or
                having one of his three daughters replace him. The self-less
                and childlike Belle chose to take her father's place and sacrifice
                herself as a hostage, but soon found that her repulsive-looking
                captor treated her with kindness, politeness and riches. Slowly,
                she began to develop an affection for the cursed and virile Bete,
                who met her every evening at 7 in the dining room, and asked
                to marry her. When she left for a few days to attend to her sick
                father, she found the Bete dying (of heartbreak) upon her tardy
                return. He was transformed, and a spell was broken, when she
                expressed deep sorrow and love for him. He was now a charming
                Prince (also Jean Marais), while Avenant now came under the spell
                as the new Bete. In the film's happily-ever-after conclusion,
                the transformed Beast - now a new Prince - revealed that a fairy
                had cursed him, because his parents didn't believe in fairies.
                Belle and the Prince returned to the castle by flying. They were
                to live there, with the father and her sisters, who would now
                serve her.</font></p>        </td>

                  (1946)</a>,</b> 172 minutes, D: William Wyler<br />
            William Wyler's landmark, classic drama, and Best Picture-winning
            film was both powerful and provocative, with many touching moments
            in the lives of combat survivors now returned to their former lives,
            with both hopefulness and poignancy -  attempting
              readjustment to peacetime life and discovering that they had fallen
              behind.  The lengthy film featured great acting, story-telling,
            direction and pacing by Wyler. It was based upon the 1945 novella
            &quot;Glory for Me&quot; by MacKinlay Kantor. It was perhaps the most memorable
            film about the aftermath of World War II, unfolding with a number
            of great plot threads about the homecoming of three servicemen to
            their small town. The compassionate movie portrayed the reality of
            altered lives, readjustments at work, dislocated marriages and the
            inability to communicate the experience of war on the front lines
            or the home front. This was the first picture for Harold Russell,
            a non-actor and war veteran who was an actual amputee, who won two
            Oscars for the same role (a unique achievement) - Best Supporting
            Actor, and a Special Honorary Oscar &quot;For bringing
            hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance...&quot; In
            the film's opening set in the nose of a B-17 bomber, three returning
            veterans had their first glimpse of their (fictional) hometown of
            Boone City - feeling alienated, aloof and detached from the strange
            sights and memories of their former home - and attempting readjustment
            to peacetime life and discovering that they had fallen behind. The
            three WWII veterans were: middle-class husband Army Sergeant Al Stephenson
            (Fredric March), a former Cornbelt Bank banker who turned to drinking,
            decorated Air Force Captain Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) who was rejected
            by his unfaithful war-bride spouse Marie Derry (Virginia Mayo) and
            was forced to return to his old job as a soda-jerk, and handicapped
            seaman Homer Parrish (Oscar-winning Harold Russell) who had lost
            both arms and agonized over his relationship with his childhood sweetheart-girlfriend
            Wilma Cameron (Cathy O'Donnell). In the film's most poignant moment,
            Homer's mother (Minna Gombell) experienced her first look at her
            double-amputee son's hooks for hands, and had an uncontrollable reaction.
            During his deeply-moving homecoming reunion scene, Sgt. Al Stephenson
            entered his apartment complex and then the door of his apartment
            and silenced with his cupped hand the mouths of his son Rob (Michael
            Hall) and daughter Peggy (Teresa Wright) - and then suddenly, his
            wife Milly (Myrna Loy) was surprised to realize that he had come
            through the door. Fred experienced PTSD - fitful, sweaty nightmares
            of a disastrous bombing run over Germany, while Peggy (a trained
            nurse) comforted and soothed him. Persistent and young Peggy Stephenson,
            Al's intelligent, articulate, headstrong daughter, made some remarkable
            homewrecking efforts to win Fred away from his mismatched marriage
            to his unloving blonde floozy wife Marie Derry. Another  of the most
            remarkable scenes was of Fred Derry's walk through a junked airplane
            graveyard where he relived his many wartime memories of bombing missions
            in the nose of an abandoned B-17 bomber. The film concluded with
            Homer's wedding to Wilma, when he demonstrated great skill in placing
            a ring on her finger - with the added knowledge that Peggy and Fred
            - seen in the background - would eventually also marry after his
            divorce with Marie could be finalized.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Howard Hawks<br />
            Howard Hawks' and Warner Bros.' classic atmospheric film noir mystery
            with crackling dialogue was based upon Raymond Chandler's first novel
            in 1939. Its incomprehensible plot (and tortuous
            story line without a completely clear resolution) was scripted by
            William Faulkner (with Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett).  It set
            the standard for private detective movies, and was remade in 1978
            with Robert Mitchum. The film's title was a reference to death. In
            the film's opening, down-at-the-heels, tough LA private investigator
            Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart). was hired by General Sternwood
            (Charles Waldron), a dying, invalid millionaire, to look into various
            issues that led to drugs, nymphomania, pornography, decadence and
            murder. Marlowe's main task was to prevent a blackmailer from collecting
            debts from Sternwood that had been incurred by the old man's  
            indiscreet, thumb-sucking, unstable nymphette youngest daughter Carmen
            (Martha Vickers). She was both spoiled, childish,
            irresponsible, and  involved with pornographers who were
            blackmailing her (and her sister) for $5,000 regarding her pictures'
            prints and negatives. Marlowe learned that the General's friend (surrogate
            son) and companion Sean Regan had also mysteriously disappeared -
            and was likely to be dead. The private eye became sexually attracted
            to the older, feisty and sultry daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall) when
            she became curious about Marlowe's investigation, but worried that
            he was digging too deep. In the twisting tale, the blackmailer, bookstore
            owner Arthur Geiger (Theodore von Eltz) was shot dead and shortly
            later, Sternwood's replacement chauffeur Owen Taylor was also found
            murdered. As the blackmail case progressed, Marlowe described his
            suspicions to gambler Eddie Mars (John Ridgely) that Carmen had killed
            her father's missing companion Sean Regan, when
            he refused her sexual advances. She murdered Regan out of jealousy
            (and unrequited love) over an imaginary relationship between Regan
            and Mars' wife Mrs. Mona Mars (Peggy Knudsen). [Note: Mona was discovered
            hiding out at Huck's Garage, to make it look like she had run away
            with Regan during their entirely manufactured affair.] At Vivian's
            request, Mars had covered up Regan's killing to &quot;protect&quot; her
            sister Carmen from guilt - and to prevent her sick father from any
            further suffering. Mars' cold-blooded hired killer Canino (Bob Steele),
            hid Regan's body and the deception was set up. Mars then blackmailed
            Vivian for money and sexual favors. Marlowe cleverly set up Mars
             to be killed by his own henchmen, allowing Marlowe to
            protect Carmen (who was sent &quot;away&quot; to an institution for
            psychiatric care) and Vivian by pinning the murder of Regan on Mars
            - and Marlow was also able to end up with Vivian.</font></p>          </td>

          <font size="2"> Raymond Chandler's
              Oscar-nominated screenplay provided the who-dun-it script for this
              classic hard-boiled Alan Ladd/Veronica Lake noirish crime film.
              It was the third of four screen pairings between Alan Ladd and
              Veronica Lake. Director George Marshall combined various elements
              to produce a well-made noir, about a hard-nosed GI soldier returning
              from service who became entangled with a mysterious blonde when
              they were both faced with unraveling a murder. Its tagline was: &quot;Tamed
        by a brunette - framed by a blonde - blamed by the cops!&quot; Returning
        28 year-old WWII veteran and naval flier Lt. Cmdr. Johnny Morrison (Alan
        Ladd) was one of three soldiers discharged from service and in Southern
        California. His buddies included Buzz Wanchek (William Bendix) (with
        a serious mental health disability) and George Copeland (Hugh Beaumont).
        At her luxurious Hollywood garden bungalow during a cocktail party, Johnny
        soon discovered that his boozing, unfaithful estranged wife Helen (Doris
        Dowling) had been promiscuous with LA's <i>The
        Blue Dahlia</i> nightclub owner Eddie Harwood (Howard Da Silva) 
		during his absence. When the party broke up, Helen quarreled with Johnny, 
		and then confessed that she lied
        to him about the death of their young son. He had not died from diptheria,
        but was killed in a DUI car-crash accident while she was driving - drunk.
        Johnny angrily pulled out his gun on her (he hinted: &quot;That's
        what I oughta do, but you're not worth it&quot;), but then he walked
        out on her while throwing his gun into an armchair before leaving the
        bungalow. Ironically, Johnny was hitchhiking
        with his suitcase and picked up in the rain by Harwood's wife,
        long blonde-haired wife Joyce (Veronica Lake), but remained anonymous
        to each other. She helped him leave town as the two shared a drive up
        the coast to Malibu and beyond, and after parting were not aware until
        the next morning that they both spent the night at the same beachfront
        motel, the Royal Beach Inn (in separate rooms). News on the radio arrived
        that Johnny's buddy Buzz was wanted for the murder of Helen - and that
        he also was presumed to be a prime suspect. He returned by bus back to
        Los Angeles, took an assumed name (Jimmy Moore) and rented a cheap hotel,
        while trying to clear his name (with some independent assistance from
        Joyce). Meddlesome bungalow motel house detective &quot;Dad&quot; Newell (Will Wright) was
        questioned by police and testified that he had heard Johnny fighting
        with Helen, and that he had witnessed Harwood later in the night enter
        her bungalow. The police also interviewed numerous other suspects, including
        Harwood and Buzz. Joyce was also considered as a possible suspect. In
        the conclusion, most of the suspects were assembled in <i>The Blue Dahlia</i> nightclub
        as the police authorities pressured Buzz to confess. The surprise killer
        was revealed to be disgruntled house detective 'Dad' Newell. He had attempted
            to blackmail Helen about her affair with Eddie, but when she refused
        to comply, he killed her. When Newell pulled out
        a gun after incriminating himself, he was startled when a door opened
        behind him and shot dead by the police Captain. The film ended as Johnny
        suggested continuing his relationship with Joyce. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: David Lean<br />
            David Lean's melodramatic romance was based on the  1936
            Noel Coward one-act play (<i>Still Life</i>). It was a poignant,
            sensitively-told, restrained British story about forbidden
            passion in a brief platonic, extra-marital affair. It was the quintessential,
            desperate tale of unconsummated illicit love. The romanticism of
            the film was enhanced by Rachmaninoff's <em>Piano
          Concerto No. 2</em> musical score. It told about
          two married strangers who had a chance meeting on the platform of the
          Milford Junction train station, and subsequently developed a forbidden
          romance. Although not known until further into the film, <i>Brief Encounter</i> opened
              in the past - as a middle-aged couple met and then parted for
              the last time. The same scene of their final moments was played
              out another time at the film's downbeat conclusion after an extended
              full flashback - filtered by the woman's subjective perspective
              in the last scene. The two English citizens
              were idealistic married local doctor, Dr. Alec Harvey (Leslie Howard)
              and middle-class suburban housewife and mother Laura Jesson (Celia
              Johnson), who found herself stuck in a loveless marriage. Their
              casual friendship and acquaintanceship involving casual weekly
              encounters soon turned into a romantic relationship and they fell
              in love. A planned tryst to consummate their affair was aborted.
              They agreed to separate and stop seeing each other when he took
              an assignment in another country - a medical journey to South Africa.
              During their final day together, they were interrupted by Laura's
              talkative and gossipy friend Dolly Messiter (Everley Gregg) during
              a painful, repressed goodbye as Alec gently placed his hand on
              her shoulder and disappeared forever. The anguished Laura attempted
              a near-suicide (with a mad, self-destructive urge signified by
              a tilted camera) when she jumped up abruptly from the table and
              rushed outside the tea room to the rail platform. Her internal
              state was externalized and stylized as disorienting and unbalanced.
              At the edge of the platform as the train screeched through, she
              contemplated throwing herself under the passing train, but lacked
              the courage to do so. In the final scene following their parting
              after such a brief encounter, her flashback ended as the film jumped
              from her standing at the doorway of the tea room, to a view of
              her seated in her armchair in her home - stuck back in her predictable
              and humdrum middle-class existence and routine. Dazed, disoriented,
              defeated (?) and jarred by memories of her passionate love affair,
              she was in the company of Fred Jesson (Cyril Raymond) -
              her unemotional but thankful husband (&quot;Thank you for coming back
              to me&quot;). </font></p>          </td>

        Although critically nicknamed &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot; by its detractors,
        director King Vidor's film remains one of the top box-office westerns
        - in inflation-adjusted dollars. [Note: In fact, Vidor quit and was one
        of eight directors and cinematographers.] The ambitious scandalous production
        from David O. Selznick was a &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;-
        type grand western with an <i>amour
        fou</i> tale. This lurid Technicolor western, set in Texas in the 1880s  at the
        Spanish Bit cattle ranch, was a sprawling, overheated melodramatic
        saga of sexual longing that was forced to cut nine minutes of its content
        before widespread release. The tale opened with the hanging execution
        of Scott Chavez (Herbert Marshall) (for the murder of his Indian wife
        and her lover). His unrefined, 'half-breed'
        gypsy daughter Pearl Chavez (Jennifer Jones) was left orphaned and without
        a home. Meanwhile, crippled Senator Jackson McCanles (Lionel Barrymore) ruled as the patriarch
        of the cattle baron family at the Spanish Bit Texas cattle ranch.
        His long-suffering, weak wife was Laura Belle McCanles (Lillian Gish),
        and they had two &quot;Cain and Abel&quot; archetypal sons: moderate, kind-hearted
        and cultured Jesse (Joseph Cotten) who had studied law, and hot-tempered,
          gun-slinging and amoral Lewt (Gregory Peck). Pearl was taken in to
        live at the ranch by Scott's second-cousin and ex-sweetheart/lover Laura.
        At the same time, McCanles and other ranchers had joined forces to defend
        their lands from encroachment by the railroad companies. Pearl was
        soon caught in a very lethal and destructive love triangle between the
        two McCanles sons. In the violent orgiastic, melodramatic ending, Pearl
        and Lewt shot each other to the death at Squaw's Head Rock and died in
        each other's arms. </font></p>          </td>

        minutes, D: Charles Vidor<br />
        Director Charles Vidor's semi-trashy, steamy crime
        drama was known for the erotic strains of the strange, tawdry, aberrant
        romantic triangle (menage a trois) between the three main characters. The
        film-noirish screenplay by Marion Parsonnet (and adapted by Jo Eisinger),
        was taken from an original story by E. A. Ellington. The
              film's themes included implied impotence, misogyny and homosexuality,
              although only suggested with liberal euphemisms and innuendo to
              bypass the Production Code. The complex,
              eccentric, perverse, and cynical tale was in keeping with the prevailing
              attitudes of the American post-war era, playing upon US political
              paranoia of German-Nazi war criminals who escaped and assumed new
              identities in South America. [Note: Another similar plotline was
              found in Hitchcock's <i><a href="noto.html">Notorious (1946)</a></i>]. 
			  The titular <i>femme fatale</i> Gilda
            Mundson Farrell (Rita Hayworth) was put into the care and keeping
              of her ex-lover (a gambler and small-time hood) and bodyguard Johnny
              Farrell (Glenn Ford) - the right hand man of her disagreeable South
              American casino-owning, mobster husband Ballin Mundson (George
              Macready). The sultry Gilda performed a  seductive striptease
              (to the tune of <i>Put the
              Blame on Mame</i>) when onstage, she removed long black satin gloves
            from her arms. When Mundson disappeared and was presumed
              dead, Gilda and Farrell resumed their dangerous affair, while Farrell
              ran the casino - but then Mundson vengefully returned. </font></p>        </td>

        D: David Lean<br />
         This definitive British drama was based on Charles Dickens' novel (and
         the first of two films director David Lean adapted from Dickens' works),
         with deserved Oscar wins for its detailed set design and black-and-white
         cinematography. It has long been considered
         one of the best adaptations ever made of a Dickens novel, and one of
         the finest British films of all-time. It told about an orphaned British
         boy befriended by a mysterious benefactor, and later becoming a gentleman
         of means (a man of &quot;great expectations&quot;).  It began with the voice-over: &quot;My
         father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name, Phillip, my
         infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
         than 'Pip'. So I called myself Pip and came to be called Pip.&quot; Then
         it proceeded to a very memorable, gloomy opening sequence of young Pip
         (Tony Wager) meeting escaped convict Abel Magwitch (Finlay Currie) in
         a graveyard. Pip then served as a hired playmate to a young adoptive
         daughter named Estella who was cared for by a wealthy, eccentric, and
         mysterious older woman in an dilapidated estate. Later, Pip was given
         a financial fortune (an allowance and funds for education) from an unknown
         source (not Miss Havisham!), and opportunistically became wealthy 
		 and cultured, although snobbish. All
         of the Dickens' characters were faithfully portrayed - John Mills took
         the role of the older Pip and Jean Simmons as the young Estella, Martita
         Hunt as Miss Havisham, and Francis L. Sullivan (who played the same
         role in the 1934 Hollywood version) as Mr. Jaggers, Miss Havisham's
         lawyer. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Frank Capra<br />
            Director Frank Capra's sweet-natured, sentimental, inspirational
            classic drama was about a near-suicidal man learning the value of
            his existence. A charitable, hard-working philanthropist George Bailey
            (James Stewart), forced to remain in a small town by unpredictable
            circumstances, became depressed after an accidental financial disaster
            at his loan company had benefited the miserly Mr. Potter (Lionel
            Barrymore). George was on the verge of committing suicide and wishing
            that he had never been born - when his crusty-but-lovable guardian
            angel Clarence (Henry Travers), who was desperately trying to earn
            his wings, showed up to give him a tour of his town without his presence
            (Bedford Falls had become the decadent and hellish Pottersville),
            showing him how important he'd been to the lives of his loved ones.
            Moral courage, small-town American life, civic cooperation, and family
            love were glorified while corporate greed and selfishness were condemned,
            climaxed by the man's rescue during an idyllic Christmas card finale.
            Clarence earned his wings and George learned that wealth was measured
            in love and friendship.</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Robert Siodmak<br />
            Director Robert Siodmak's  classic, definitive film noir, taken from
            a short story by Ernest Hemingway, was told in eleven taut flashbacks
            after a bravura opening murder sequence. The film's main musical
            theme (with a rising and falling dum-de-dum dum) from composer Miklos
            Rozsa was later borrowed for the opening sequence of TV's <i>Dragnet</i>.
            Two hit men Al (Charles McGraw) and Max (William Conrad) entered
            a greasy-spoon diner in Brentwood New Jersey, asking the manager
            about Ole 'Swede' Andersen (Burt Lancaster, in his film debut) -
            a gas station attendant. The doomed 'Swede' (an ex-boxer), who had
            been hiding in town under an alias for six years, was warned in a
            nearby boardinghouse. Indifferent, he expected their arrival and
            calmly, passively awaited their deadly approach. Insurance investigator
            Jim Reardon (Edmond O'Brien) pieced together and unraveled the plot
            and reconstructed the life of the victim through interviews and detective
            work. He discovered a complex tale of crime and treacherous betrayal
            - all revolving around a beautifully-glamorous, mysterious, double-crossing <em>femme
            fatale</em> Kitty Collins
			(Ava Gardner) - who sang &quot;The More

          <p><font size="2"><strong>A Matter of Life and Death (1946, UK) (aka
                Stairway to Heaven)</strong>, 104 minutes, D: Michael Powell,
                Emeric Pressburger<br />
            Reminiscent of other heavenly fantasies, including <i>Here Comes
            Mr. Jordan (1941) </i>and<i> Down to Earth (1947)</i>, this was one
            of the most innovative, visually-dazzling (from cinematographer Jack
            Cardiff), literate, and audacious films ever made by the extraordinary
            writer/producer/director team of the Archers production company:
            Powell and Pressburger. The film was an extravagant and extraordinary
            fantasy in which WWII RAF pilot and squadron leader Peter David Carter
            (David Niven) must abandon his fiery bomber (returning from a raid
            over Germany) without a functional parachute. Knowing his fate was
            doomed, he nonetheless fell deeply in love with British-based, WAC
            radio operator and ground controller June (Kim Hunter) as they shared
            a few last words. In a film that continually begged the question,
            what was real and what was imagined, he awakened unharmed on a beach
            after falling to his 'death', due to errors made by heavenly emissary
            Conductor 71 (Marius Goring) in the fog. During brain surgery to
            rid him of alleged hallucinations, his spirit was put on trial --
            and he had to justify his continuing existence on Earth to a panel
            of heavenly judges in a celestial court (with God (Abraham Sofaer)
            as his judge, recently-deceased friend Dr. Frank Reeves (Robert Livesey)
            as his defense lawyer, and Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey) as the
            prosecutor). He had to convince them that he should survive and wed
            his romantic sweetheart June. In a bold stroke, the Heavenly sequences
            were filmed in black-and-white, while the Earthbound scenes were
            in vibrant, ravishing Technicolor. The film used various then-revolutionary
            film techniques such as time-lapse photography, mixing monochrome
            and color in the same shot, and background time-freezes when a spirit
            left the body, reminscient of <em><a href="matrix.html">The
            Matrix (1999</a></em><a href="series-matrix.html">)</a>.
            One shot typified just how different the film was -- a point-of-view
            (POV) shot from <em>within</em> an eyeball during brain surgery.
            The most spectacular dream sequence was the slow ascent to heaven
            on a giant stairway, and the film's most memorable image was of a
        single, glittering love tear on a red rose petal.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: John Ford<br />
              <i>My Darling Clementine</i> was one of John Ford's greatest westerns.
               This semi-historical account was based on the famous 1881 O.K.
              Corral gunfight - inevitably visualized in the conclusion. The
              title credits were underscored by the singing of the folk song &quot;(Oh
              My Darling) Clementine&quot;
          by a cowboy chorus. It was  the tale of the four Earp brothers - in
          the early 1880s, during a cattle drive through Arizona enroute to California.
          They had the first of many encounters with Old Man Clanton (Walter
          Brennan) and his Clanton gang of scurrilous gunfighters - who met with
          one-time outlaw gunslinger Wyatt Earp (Henry Fonda) on the trail and
          told him of the nearby town of Tombstone, AZ in 1882. Three of the
          four Earp brothers ventured to the uncivilized, wild town of Tombstone
          that evening - a lawless town (without a marshal) - evidenced in the
          early scene when Wyatt Earp's haircut with a barber (Ben Hall), a symbol
          of advanced civilization on the frontier, was interrupted by a shooting
          outdoors by drunken Indian Charlie (Charles Stevens) (Wyatt: &quot;What
          kind of a town is this anyway? Excuse me ma'am. A man can't get a shave
          without gettin' his head blowed off&quot;)
          - and Wyatt was forced to subdue the man. When the Earps returned to
          their campsite, Wyatt  suspected that the Clantons had rustled
          the Earp cattle and murdered his younger brother James Earp (Don Garner).
          Wyatt decided to seek revenge, by becoming the town's dedicated, law-abiding
          marshal (and making his surviving brothers his deputies), to clean
          up the rowdy frontier town where the killers of his brothers, led by
          Old Man Clanton, had fled and ruled. Wyatt developed a friendship with
          hot-tempered, well-educated gambler, gunfighter and saloon chief Dr.
          John Henry &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday (Victor Mature), 
		  originally a cultured Bostonian, who was suffering
          from TB (or &quot;consumption&quot;). His mistress was hot-blooded
          Mexican saloon dancer-singer Chihuahua (Linda Darnell). Earp cultivated
          a romance with  Clementine Carter (Cathy Downs),
          the town's new school teacher. She was &quot;Doc's&quot; former
          ex-lover/fiancee from Boston, who had arrived in town to locate him,
          but he spurned her. Earp majestically escorted Clementine
            to a church service (dedicating the laying of the foundation of a
            new church to be built), and the church's open-air social dance -
          a fundraiser.  The man who killed Wyatt's
          brother James - Billy Clanton (John Ireland), fearing that Chihuahua
          would implicate him in the murder of James,  shot
          and mortally-wounded Chihuahua, and  despite
          efforts of &quot;Doc&quot; to save her with surgery, she soon died.
          After killing Billy, Wyatt's brother Virgil Earp (Tim Holt) was  
          cold-bloodedly shot in the back by Old Man Clanton at their homestead.
          After the climactic shootout against the Earps at the OK Corral that
          decimated the Clantons, Doc Holliday's affliction weakened him and
          made him vulnerable, and he died during the shoot-out. At the film's
          end -- Earp bid goodbye to Clementine before riding off away from the
          camera toward the rock monuments in the distance in the last image:
          (&quot;Ma'am, I sure like that name - Clementine&quot;) - he was leaving
          town and joining up with his brother Morgan Earp (Ward Bond). </font></p>          </td>

            This was Hitchcock's ninth Hollywood film - a highly-acclaimed,
            post WWII noirish spy thriller/romance set in Brazilian South America.
            An alluring, alcoholic playgirl Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman),
            the daughter of a convicted Nazi agent, was reluctantly exploited
            and drafted by the CIA to become a US government agent and secretly
            infiltrate into a shady group of Axis Germans. Watchful American
            agent Devlin (Cary Grant) turned chilly toward her, uncertain of
            her love and loose-living past during a cruel love affair. To spite
            him when Devlin didn't protest her marriage, she wed her Nazi
            espionage target Alexander Sebastian (Claude Rains), a former friend
            of her father's, to acquire access to information, including the
            MacGuffin (uranium in wine bottles) in his wine cellar. Trapped in
            her enemy's home, where her husband was oppressed by his cold, domineering
            mother Mme. Sebastian (Leopoldine Konstantin), Alicia was slowly
            poisoned with arsenic and in mortal danger until rescued by guilt-ridden
            Devlin. The film featured the most famous marathon screen kiss in
            film history, the zoom shot toward the wine cellar key, the wine
            cellar sequence, and the staircase-descending finale.</font></p></td>

        by director Rossellini and Federico Fellini, and filmed in an authentic,

                  (1946)</a>,</b> 113 minutes, D: Tay Garnett<br />
            Director Tay Garnett's  stylish moody adaptation of James M. Cain's
            1934 torrid crime melodrama novel about the
            murderous effects of lust, told in flashback, was one
            of the best film noirs ever made. [Note: It was the third adaptation
            of Cain's novel, following Pierre Chenal's <i>Le
            Dernier Tournant (1939, Fr.)</i> and Luchino Visconti's <i>Ossessione
            (1943, It.)</i>. Another modern US remake was Bob Rafelson's <i>The
            Postman Always Rings Twice (1981) </i>starring Jack Nicholson and
            Jessica Lange.] Handsome hitch-hiking drifter Frank Chambers (John
            Garfield) was hired at the California roadside Twin Oaks diner/restaurant
            as a handyman by kindly, middle-aged, alcoholic proprietor Nick Smith
            (Cecil Kellaway). He was mostly interested in getting to know Nick's
            sizzling, lustfully white-hot (and unhappy), platinum-blonde waitress
            wife Cora (Lana Turner). The slow-burning fuse of sexual passion
            between Frank and tawdry adulteress Cora  was first manifestly evident
            when they decided to run away and elope, but they decided to return.
            Over time, they came to the belief that the only way to be together
            was to plot the 'accidental' death of her husband to live off the
            inheritance. The murderous couple's first clumsy attempt at a fatal
            bathtub accident failed when a cat tripped the power lines and aborted
            the plan. Their plottings became more intense when Nick threatened
            to sell the diner and move with Cora to Northern Canada to live at
            his invalid, paralyzed sister's home. Their second plan to kill Nick
            was to get him drunk and then stage an automobile accident at Malibu
            Lake. They proceeded to ply Nick with liquor before clubbing him
            and pushing his car off a cliff. Slimy District Attorney Kyle Sackett
            (Leon Ames) was hot on their trail, and used a strategy of pitting
            the two against each other to draw convictions. After Frank (to avoid
            becoming Cora's accomplice) was tricked into signing an official
            complaint against Cora, alleging that she tried to kill both him
            and Nick, Cora also confessed and admitted to the charges but was
            later released on lesser charges of manslaughter. Although the couple
            didn't fully trust each other (and would ultimately be undone by
            their own uncontrollable, calculating
            natures), the two were married for respectability's sake. During
            Cora's week-long trip to visit her ailing mother in Iowa, Frank engaged
            in a brief affair with Madge Gorland (Audrey Totter) that was discovered
            by Cora upon her return. Cora also divulged that she was pregnant.
            During a moonlight swim, Cora dramatically threatened suicide, but
            Frank saved her from drowning and the two decided they truly loved
            each other. As they drove home before a fatal automobile crash, Cora
            admitted before her death: &quot;When we get home, Frank, then there'll
            be kisses, kisses with dreams in them. Kisses that come from life,
            not death.&quot; Frank was  convicted of Cora's murder and sentenced
            to be executed. A note was found written earlier by Cora that revealed
            her true love for Frank, but it also showed that they had plotted
            Nick's murder together. They would both pay a price for their misdeeds,
            even after they had both evaded charges for killing Nick.  On Death
            Row, although Frank in his own mind was absolved of Cora's death
            - &quot;the
            postman always rings twice&quot; - he was led to his execution for
            Nick's death (and for committing adultery), after telling the priest
            Father McConnell (Tom Dillon): &quot;Somehow or other Cora paid for
            Nick's life with hers. And now I'm going to. Father, would you send
            up a prayer for me and Cora? And if you could find it in your heart...
            make it that we're together, wherever it is.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Razor's Edge (1946), </b>146 minutes, D: Edmund
        Goulding<br />
        This  outstanding romantic (melo)-drama by director Edmund Goulding (and
        produced by Darryl F. Zanuck for 20th Century Fox) was taken from
        W. Somerset Maugham's 1944 novel (adapted by scriptwriter Lamar Trotti).
         Although long, gloomy and rambling, it was about the search for life's
        intellectual and spiritual meaning - and enlightenment. In the film,
         idealistic, wealthy young Larry Darrell (Tyrone Power) served
         in the war as a pilot and narrowly escaped death when a comrade saved
         him. His entire being was  shaken, traumatized
         and disillusioned by the horrors of WWI, and he restlessly set
         out to seek truth and goodness for the remainder of his life. He explained
         the rationale for his search: &quot;It
            was the last day of the war, almost the last moment. He could have
         saved himself, but, he didn't. He saved me, and, died. So he's gone
         and I'm here, alive. Why? It's all so meaningless! You can't help but
         ask yourself what life is all about. Whether there's any sense to it
         or whether it's just a stupid blunder!&quot; In Chicago in 1919, wealthy,
         upper-class, social-climbing, worldly beauty Isabel Bradley (Gene Tierney)
            offered him love and stability as his fiancee, but she agreed to
         postpone their marriage so Larry could first travel to Paris 
          to find himself. Larry would be mentored by Isabel's snobbish uncle
         Elliott Templeton (Clifton Webb), a wealthy bachelor, during his time
         in European society. In Paris, however, Larry rejected Templeton's offer
         and became part of a &quot;Lost Generation&quot; of
            seekers that renounced wealth. He moved into very modest accommodations
            on the Left Bank. About a year later, Isabel visited Larry in Paris
            - and decided that she couldn't marry him, due to her concerns
            about his lack of desire for ambition, wealth and status. She broke
         off their engagement, but then just before leaving France, she set about
         to seduce Larry into having sex, and then would later blackmail him
            into marriage by feigning pregnancy. However, she couldn't carry
            through with her devious plan, and shortly later returned to Chicago
            and married millionaire stockbroker Gray Maturin (John Payne)
            to insure a life of luxury and elite power for herself. Larry continued
            to pursue his quest for truth by first working as a coal miner, and
         then taking a pilgrimage to the Himalayan mountains of Nepal, where
         he was taught the truths about life through an old mystic Hindu guru,
         Holy Man (Cecil Humphreys) (&quot;As long
            as man sets his ideals on the wrong objects, there can be no real
            happiness. Until men learn it comes from within themselves&quot;).
            He learned that the path to salvation was as difficult to pass
            over as the sharp edge of a razor. Larry eventually found enlightenment,
            peace, personal serenity and freedom, and was ready to return to
            the world. When he returned almost a decade later to Paris in 1931,
            he learned about the fates of his former acquaintances - many of
            whom had suffered challenging experiences. Strong-willed Isabel's
            husband had lost his wealth in the stock market crash of 1929 and
            suffered a nervous breakdown, with frequent debilitating headaches.
            Isabel and Gray Maturin were now living in Paris in Elliott's apartment
            (while he resided in the Riviera). Larry was also reunited with former
            childhood friend Sophie Nelson (Oscar-winning Anne Baxter) whose
            husband Bob MacDonald (Frank Latimore) and child were killed in an
            automobile accident. Sophie was discovered in a working-class bistro,
            degraded and wracked by alcoholism, drug use and prostitution (for
            an abusive pimp) in a lower class district of Paris. With his efforts,
            Larry was able to bring the unstable widow back to sobriety and soon
            became engaged to marry her. However, Isabel was resolute on reigniting
            her relationship with Larry, and jealously conspired to cause Sophie's
            self-destructive demise by tempting her to begin drinking again with
            a bottle of expensive Hungarian liqueur. Sophie henceforth disappeared
            into the Parisian underworld, was found in an opium den, and within
            a year, Sophie's victimization ended with her murder in Toulon. Larry
            blamed Isabel for deliberately encouraging and tempting Sophie, although
            Isabel claimed she did it to save Larry and as a way to test Sophie's
            strength. Larry refused to reconcile with Isabel and walked away
            from her - forever. He announced his intention to return to America
            by supporting himself as a common laborer. Isabel finally realized: &quot;I've
            lost him for good.&quot; Isabel asked the film's detached W. Somerset Maugham character (Herbert
            Marshall), a British novelist, what he thought that Larry had accomplished,
            and was told, in the film's final lines of dialogue, that Larry had
            obviously found the key to true happiness and goodness: (&quot;His
            America will be as remote from yours as the Gobi Desert....My dear
            Larry has found what we all want and very few of us ever get. I don't
            think anyone can fail to be better and nobler, kinder for knowing
            him. You see, my dear, goodness is after all the greatest force in
            the world, and he's got it.&quot; The last shot was of Larry on the
            deck of a ship in the pouring rain, working as a lowly deck-hand
            to pay for his passage home.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Spiral Staircase (1946),</b> 83 minutes,
                D: Robert Siodmak</font><br />
            <font size="2">Director Robert Siodmak's  classic,
            old-fashioned haunted house horror film with Gothic (and Hitchcockian)
            elements involved a threatened female and a serial killer (who specialized
            in killing imperfect, physically-flawed, handicapped or &quot;afflicted&quot;
          women).  [Note: The set was the house from Orson Welles' <i><a href="magn.html">The
          Magnificent Ambersons (1942)</a></i>.] The stylish, suspenseful, and
          taut thriller - and frightening psychological drama-mystery, was based
          on crime writer Ethel Lina White's 1933 novel &quot;Some Must Watch,&quot;
          and was remade as <i>The Spiral Staircase (1975, UK)</i> with Jacqueline
          Bisset, Christopher Plummer, and Mildred Dunnock. Set in 1916 in a
          small town in New England (Vermont), the film opened with the third
          murder committed by the killer (who  strangled a paraplegic female
          in her hotel room) in the neighborhood. A young mute servant-caretaker
          Helen Chapel (Dorothy McGuire) was hired to assist a wealthy, widowed,
          bed-ridden invalid matron Mrs. Warren (Ethel Barrymore) with powers
          of perception in a large spooky mansion (with many secret doors and
          heavy draperies, and of course, a circular staircase) - where the killer
          was hiding in the shadows within the house. An atmosphere of terror
          in the old dark mansion was intensified with a raging storm outside,
          high contrast or light and dark shadows, a spiral staircase,  a view of feet behind a heavy curtain,
          gusts of wind, flickering candlelights, and creaking doors. The local
          bachelor doctor, Dr. Parry (Kent Smith), Mrs. Warren's local physician
          and one of Helen's love interests, believed that her inability to speak
          had been trauma-induced (from witnessing a house fire that killed her
          parents) and was possibly reversible. He was planning to take her to
          Boston to help her work through her psychological issues. Two other
          suitors (rival step-brothers) who lived in the house included Mrs.
          Warren's anti-social stepson - scholarly biologist Professor Albert
          Warren (George Brent), and her real younger son - the irresponsible,
          impudent and womanizing Steven Warren (Gordon Oliver), who recently
          returned from living abroad. He was involved in a brief affair with
          Albert's live-in, bespectacled assistant-secretary Blanche (Rhonda
          Fleming). The young, tormented and victimized mute Helen soon came
          to believe that she would be the killer's next victim, after Blanche
          was attacked and murdered in the basement. In the exciting conclusion,
          it was implied that Steven had murdered Blanche, and Helen (who suspected
          him) locked him up in a closet, only to then realize that the real
          killer was Professor Warren. The defenseless Helen screamed
              at her extreme moment of peril on the spiral staircase when chased
               by the Professor, and was saved by Mrs. Warren who emerged from
               her bedroom, staggered out and shot her stepson multiple times
               in the chest, and then fainted (died?) in Steven's arms. In the
               suspenseful climax, now with restored speech, Helen then uttered
               her first words since childhood with a phone call to an operator,
               asking for Dr. Parry: (&quot;1-8-9...Dr.
              Parry...Come...It's I, Helen&quot;) - the film's final line of
          dialogue.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Lewis Milestone<br />
              This sordid, noirish, B/W melodrama told about three childhood
              friends who were brought together 18 years later for a climactic
              denouement regarding a murderous and guilty secret from the past,
          in the Pennsylvania town of Iverstown. The film
          opened in 1928 with young heiress Martha Ivers (Janis Wilson as a girl)
          bludgeoning (with a cane) her domineering, mean-spirited, tyrannical,
          wealthy Aunt Ivers (Judith Anderson) to death (on a flight of stairs,
           where afterwards, she tumbled to her death) during a raging thunderstorm
          - Martha sought revenge for her hard-hearted Aunt's caning to death
          of her beloved kitten named Bundles. At the time, Martha had repeatedly
          been planning to run away with her young, street-smart, independent-minded
          boyfriend Sam Masterson (Darryl Hickman as a boy). The
          murder was thought to have been witnessed by two boys:  Sam, who
              fled town (and joined a circus), and by  prim, and bespectacled
              Walter O'Neil (Mickey Kuhn as boy) who was at Martha's side looking
              on. The weak-willed Walter was urged by Martha to lie about the
              killing to conceal her guilt. In exchange for their help in denying
              Martha's involvement, Walter's scheming father Mr. O'Neil (Roman
          Bohnen), Martha's greedy tutor, blackmailed Martha into marrying Walter
          (so that he could acquire her inherited wealth and influence), while
          an innocent man years later was accused, condemned and executed for
              the murder of Martha's aunt. The
          love triangle clashed when they were brought together again years later
          in 1946. The three were  Martha Ivers (Barbara Stanwyck
          as adult) - a domineering, single-minded, predatory, self-interested,
          and determined <i>femme fatale</i> where she dominated everything<i>, </i>Walter
          O'Neil (Kirk Douglas as adult, in his film debut), lovelessly married
          to Martha, an alcoholic district attorney in the steelworks town of
          Iverstown, and Sam Masterson (Van Heflin as adult), Martha's former
          beau (who she was still attracted to), a decorated wartime soldier
          and gambler. Passing through Iverstown, Sam was forced to remain in
          the town after crashing his car into a signpost. Martha (and Walter)
          feared Sam's knowledge of the awful crime and would try to blackmail
          them, although at a crucial point in the film, he admitted that he
          did <u>not</u> witness
          Aunt Ivers' death (&quot;I wasn't there. I left when your Aunt came
          into the hallway. I didn't want to stick around. I was in enough trouble
          as it was. I never saw what happened. I never knew until tonight about
          your Aunt or that man. The one they hung. The man that you and Walter
          killed&quot;). [Note: In the film's major sub-plot, Sam tried
            to help a new acquaintance in town, young, sexy and pretty Antonia &quot;Toni&quot; Marachek
            (Lizabeth Scott), who was on parole (after charges of theft), but
            was arrested for violating her probation (she was supposed to leave
            town immediately). Sam appealed to DA Walter to request his influence
            in her case. Although Toni betrayed Sam and set him up for a beating,
            she was under pressure by Walter to do so, and was ultimately forgiven
            by Sam.] Martha, who had never given up her love for Sam, decided
            to seduce him and then urged him to heartlessly kill her drunken
            husband after he fell down the ubiquitous staircase and was unconscious:
            (&quot;Now, Sam.
            Do it now. Set me free. Set both of us free...Oh, Sam, it can be
            so easy&quot;). Sam refused to comply with her: (&quot;Now
            I'm sorry for ya....Martha, you're sick...You're so sick you don't
            even know the difference between right and wrong....I've never murdered&quot;).
            After Sam declined to murder Walter and even helped him to revive,
            he was prepared to walk out of the mansion, when Martha threatened
            to shoot Sam as an intruder - in &quot;self defense&quot; -  (&quot;We
            can't let him go, can we?...We'd be fools to let him go, knowing
            so much about us&quot;), but she couldn't pull the trigger on him
            and shoot him in the back. As he left, he told them: &quot;I feel
            sorry for ya, both of ya.&quot; The
          shock double-suicide ending included Martha's death when she pulled
          the trigger on herself as her jealous and drunk husband Walter held
          a gun to her stomach during a deadly embrace - and then with her draped
          limply in his arms, Walter shot himself to death. Sam witnessed the
          two deaths through a window, as he stood outside the mansion, before
          driving off with Toni westward to get married (Sam to Toni: &quot;Don't
          look back, baby. Don't ever look back. You know what happened to Lot's
          wife, don't ya?&quot;). </font></p>        </td>

              D: Orson Welles<br />
              This impressive film noir starred and was directed by Orson Welles
              - it was his first suspense-thriller. Keen-minded United Nations
              War Crimes Commission government agent-investigator Mr. Wilson
              (Edward G. Robinson) was on the trail of Nazi war criminal, fugitive
              agent Franz Kindler (Orson Welles). In the small and sleepy Connecticut
              town of Harper, the deceitful Kindler was posing as Charles Rankin,
              a respectable New England prep school teacher, engaged to marry
              Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young) - the daughter of respectable Supreme
              Court Justice Adam Longstreet (Philip Merivale). Mary was unaware
              of her fiancee's notorious past as the mastermind of the genocidal
              Holocaust. To prevent being exposed, Kindler strangled his former
              associate Meinike (Konstantin Shayne). To get to his quarry in
              a tense cat-and-mouse game, Wilson (posing as an antiques dealer)
              had to convince the suspicious Mary of her fiancee's crimes, before
              he eliminated her too. In the exciting conclusion, topped by a
              chase-finale on a church belfry tower, Mary discovered Rankin's
              plot to kill her and dared him - and when prevented and pursued,
              he fell to his death. </font></p>        </td>

              This was star Olivia de Havilland's first screen role after winning
              a landmark Supreme Court case against Warners, reducing exploitative
              studio control of actors to seven years. It was similar in plot
              to Edmund Goulding's <i>The
              Old Maid (1939)</i> with Bette Davis. The superior, sentimental
              romantic melodrama (or women's &quot;weepie&quot;) was told in
              flashback by an unwed mother (now a middle-aged American expatriate,
              and a fire-watch warden in London during an air-raid beat) who
              encountered the son she had given up for adoption many years earlier.
              Miss Josephine 'Jody' Norris (Best Actress-winning Olivia de Havilland)
              recalled a passionate, small-town love affair in Pierson Falls
              in upstate New York with Captain Bart Cosgrove (John Lund in his
              debut film), a pilot who presumably died during action in WWI (the
              Great War). She was painfully forced to give up her son for adoption
              to another family to avoid scandal. Her son was taken in by Corinne
              (Mary Anderson) and Alex Piersen (Phillip Terry) when Jody maneuvered
              herself out of the right to call the child her own. Afterwards,
              Jody spent years devoted to a successful cosmetics business, while
              her grown son American Lieutenant Gregory 'Grigsy' Pierson (also
              John Lund) only knew her through casual contact and presents (given
              by &quot;Aunt Jody&quot; - known as a friend of his &quot;mother&quot;).
              When he visited and revealed his attachment to girlfriend Liz Lorimer
              (Virginia Welles), Jody's aristocratic confidant and love interest
              Lord Desham (Roland Culver) helped their romance lead to marriage,
              and broadly hinted to Gregory the identity of his biological mother,
              in the tear-jerking happy conclusion. Liz also tipped off Grigsy: &quot;Anyone
              would have thought you were her only son&quot; - he then approached
              his mother on a dance floor and asserted: &quot;I think this is
              our dance, Mother.&quot;</font></p></td>

              Brown<br />
              Director Clarence Brown's beautiful and sensitive film was based
              on the 1938 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings.
              It was remade for TV in 1994. The inspirational family-oriented,
              coming-of-age dramatic story was about a young boy who matured
              after confronting the harsh realities of life - accepting a final
              goodbye to his beloved animal friend. In the late 1870s, somber,
              overprotective and stern Orry (Jane Wyman) and kind-hearted, understanding
              Penny Baxter (Gregory Peck) lived in the remote Florida wilderness
              (Baxter's Island) where they eked out a living on their farm. Sole
              surviving child, fresh-faced and pleasant Jody (Claude Jarman,
              Jr. in his screen debut), a lonely 12 year-old son, longed to have
              a pet to keep him company. Due to dire circumstances, Penny was
              compelled to orphan a fawn - after being bitten by a rattlesnake,
              he killed a doe to use its organs to release the poisonous venom.
              The yearling fawn, named Flag, grew closer and attached to Jody,
              but problems developed - it ate the pioneer family's hard-won crops
              of tobacco and corn, and the boy was forced to accept a painful,
              heart-wrenching decision. Rather than shoot the yearling, Jody
              released him into the woods. Tough-minded Orry shot and wounded
              Flag, and tearful Jody finished him off. Jody ran away, but then
              returned home after three days, to his relieved parents.</font></p>        </td>
