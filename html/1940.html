          <p><font size="2"><b>Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1940),</b> 110 minutes,
              D: John Cromwell<br />
            This screen adaptation was based upon Robert E. Sherwood's 1939 Pulitzer
            Prize-winning play, yet was slightly inferior to the previous year's <i>Young
            Mr. Lincoln (1939)</i> by director John Ford and starring Henry Ford.
            It was an historically accurate and realistic portrayal of Abraham
            Lincoln's (Raymond Massey, reprising his 1938 Broadway stage impersonation
            and future signature role) life as small-town resident, suitor, lawyer,
            legislator, and as the 16th President (and Great Emancipator) beginning
            in 1860. The film opened with Lincoln's poor childhood in the backwoods
            of Illinois, following his early career as a clerk in a shop in New
            Salem, Illinois, his ill-fated love for Ann Rutledge (Mary Howard)
            who was already engaged and then died tragically in 1835, his reluctant
            decision to run for political office for the first time as a Whig
            Party state assemblyman (and serve a single term), his short stint
            as a self-educated lawyer in Springfield, Illinois, his on-again,
            off-again relationship with ambitious Mary Todd (Ruth Gordon in her
            debut film role) and their eventual marriage in 1842, his election
            to a single two-year term in Congress (1846-48), his memorable debates
            (the highlight of the film) as a Republican candidate against political
            rival Senator Stephen Douglas (Gene Lockhart) who defeated Lincoln
            and won the Senate seat in 1858, and Lincoln's election to the Presidency.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>All This, And Heaven Too (1940),</b> 140 minutes,
              D: Anatole Litvak<br />
            Director Anatole Litvak's elaborate, overly-long melodramatic,19th
            century period production from Warner Bros. (with a lush score by
            Max Steiner) was set in France, and based upon Rachel Lyman Field's
            1937 best-selling novel about a scandalous, notorious and tragic
            real-life murder case in Europe. [Note: Authoress Rachel Field was
            character Henriette's grand-niece.] In the lurid but poignant marriage-drama
            story and costume drama, aloof and philandering French nobleman Duc
            de Praslin (Charles Boyer) hired Henriette Deluzy-Desportes (Bette
            Davis) as a  governess for his four children in 1846. Henriette was
            initially presented as self-reliant, composed and quietly dignified.
            While employed, the tormented Duc presumably entered into a loving
            relationship with the governess (although they never even touched
            each other in the film), while his sultry, crazed and cold wife Duchesse
            de Praslin (Barbara O'Neil) became insanely jealous, emotional and
            resentful of the kindly and loving Henriette and the affair she thought
            was occurring (and being gossiped about), although she was uncaring
            and abusive with her own four children. Henriette was fired
            from her governess position, due to the Duchesse's vindictive nature,
            and vengefully denied a letter of recommendation, leaving Henriette
            unemployed and impoverished. The debonair Duc and his governess became
            prime suspects after the Duchesse was found murdered in 1847 (hacked
            to death in her bedroom) - and Henriette was considered the Duc's
            accomplice. The Duc was placed in custody in his own home (due to
            his position, he couldn't be arrested), while Henriette was charged
            with the crime and jailed. To save her and the French government
            (because of his associations with the French king Louis-Philippe)
            from further embarrassment,
              and knowing that a trial was imminent,  
              the Duc assumed full responsibility for the crime with a deathbed
              confession after suicidally taking strychnine poison. Without admitting
              anything in particular, the Duc only claimed that Henriette was
              innocent. After the exoneration and an acquittal, Henriette was
              released from prison without evidence to hold her. When the French
              king was overthrown, she fled from France and emigrated for refuge
              to the US (where she told her story of 'de Praslin affair' in flashback,
              as the infamous 'Mademoiselle D') as a French teacher (using an
              assumed name) in NY's Miss Haines School. After listening to her
              tragic confessional story, her initially-hostile students became
              sympathetic and forgiving toward her. </font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Angels Over Broadway (1940),</b> 79 minutes, D:
        Ben Hecht and Lee Garmes<br />
        Co-director Ben Hecht's and Columbia Studios' film-noirish, shadowy crime-caper
        drama received one Academy Award nomination for Hecht's Original Screenplay.
        Its tagline was: &quot;A Romance Born Between Dusk and Dawn!&quot; In
        the opening of the somber, dialogue-rich character study about a group
        of losers, lowlifes, nobodys and hustlers, the setting was the Pigeon
        Club, a swanky Broadway nightclub-cafe in NYC. On a rainy night, an embezzler
        Charles Engle (John Qualen) was on the verge of committing suicide (he
        had written a suicide note stashed in his coat pocket), and was drinking
        heavily. He had stolen $3,000 from his boss Hopper (George Watts) to
        finance his high-spending frivolous wife, who then cuckolded him. The
        very desperate man had only a few hours (until 6 am) to pay back the
        money before being charged with the crime. Another major character was
        Bill O'Brien (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), a two-bit 'wise-guy' hustler,
        con-man and aspiring gangster who misinterpreted Engle's excessive tipping
        as a sign that he was a wealthy but eccentric rich out-of-town yokel
        who would be an easy, victimized scam-target in a card game set up by
        his go-to connection - gangster-killer Dutch Enright (Ralph Theodore).
        A third character was once-famous, disillusioned, down-on-his-luck alcoholic
        playwright Eugene &quot;Gene&quot; Gibbons
        (Thomas Mitchell), who called himself a &quot;veteran
        corpse&quot; who was in the midst of a divorce and other misfortunes:
        (&quot;I have written three bad plays in a row, and next year I'll write
        a worse one. I have neither a home, a single hope, nor a shred of curiosity
        left. Bankrupt and broke, I've destroyed myself, sir, in becoming famous.
        I am no longer a man, Mr. Engle, I'm an epitaph over an ash can!&quot;).
        A fourth individual - pretty and alluring Nina Barona (22 year-old Rita
        Hayworth in her first major lead role) was an unemployed, aspiring ballet
        dancer working at the club as a showgirl. Together, Nina, Gibbons, and
        O'Brien idealistically schemed to help or &quot;save&quot; Engle.
        Gibbons was inspired to script a new and 'happy ending' for Engle's life.
        They temporarily entered him as &quot;bait&quot; into Enright's high-stakes
        fixed poker game to fleece him, but just long enough so that he would
        win the $3,000 (regarded as initial &quot;sucker money&quot;) he needed,
        and then drop out, and reimburse his boss' stolen funds. Due to a series
        of misadventures, just before going through with the plan, Gibbons went
        home to his estranged wife before the game began, and Dutch learned of
        the devious plan. Nina and O'Brien continued to pursue their scheme to
        win the money for Engle. She convinced O'Brien to appeal to his better
        side and beat off Dutch's gambling thugs while Engle escaped down a fire
        escape with the money. In the final scene, Nina and O'Brien were brought
        together and falling in love - as she complimented him on his changed
        nature: (Nina: &quot;Something wonderful happened tonight. l'll remember
        it for a long time. Oh yes, when things don't seem so wonderful, l'll,
        I'll remember Mr. Gibbons, Mr. Engle - and you. And that people aren't
        really mean. They can be better than they are if they want. lf they'll
        let themselves. Even if it doesn't last. They can be better than they
        are&quot;). They clenched and kissed on the street at the dawning of
        a new day. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Eddie Cline<br />
            W.C. Fields appeared in his last major film role in this classic
            comedy,  with wonderful bumbling sight
            gags and hilarious one-liners. He credited himself as screenwriter
            Mahatma Kane Jeeves (similar to &quot;My
            hat, my cane, Jeeves!&quot;). As Egbert Souse (W. C. Fields) (pronounced &quot;Soo-zay&quot;),
             he was a drunken, unemployed, no-account, henpecked, child-hating
            husband living in Lompoc, California (pronounced Lompoke). His family
            who often complained: &quot;House just smells of liquor and smoke,&quot; included his
            cranky mother-in-law Mrs. Hermisillo Brunch (Jessie Ralph), his younger
            daughter Elsie Mae Adele Brunch Souse (Evelyn Del Rio), and his nagging
            wife Agatha Sous&eacute; (Cora Witherspoon). The lush barfly  often
            escaped from his family by sneaking
            out to the Black Pussy Cat Cafe for stiff drinks, where he  performed
            a drinking routine in front of bar proprietor Joe Guelpe (Shemp Howard,
            one of the replacement Three Stooges); he dipped his fingers in a
            glass of water, dried them with a paper napkin that he crumpled and
            rolled into a ball, then tossed it into the air over his shoulder
            and neatly kicked it away with the heel of his shoe, followed by
            a burb and cough. To his family's astonishment,
            he had the opportunity to direct an on-location movie in town (to
            replace drunken director A. Pismo Clam (Jack Norton)). After his
            chair toppled backwards off his majestic perch on the platform, his
            bratty young daughter Elsie Mae approached, pulled on his coat tails,
            and demanded a part in the picture: &quot;I wanna be in the picture
			 (he deferred her request by patting her
              on the head)...What's the matter, Pop? Don't ya love me?&quot;;
              when Egbert went to slug her, Cora threatened: &quot;Don't you
              dare strike that child!&quot; - to which Egbert replied: &quot;She's
              not gonna tell me I don't love her!&quot; He
              also inadvertently foiled a bank robbery in town for allegedly
            capturing Loudmouth McNasty (George Moran), one of two bank robbers
            with the money, and was rewarded for his accidental heroism with
            a free bank calendar and an in-bank position as a guard (or &quot;dick&quot;-detective)
              by grateful Lompoc State Bank president Mr. Skinner (Pierre Watkin). Egbert
                met with the pompous Mr. Skinner to be congratulated on his daring,
              gallant deed: &quot;And I wish to personally give you a hearty handclasp.&quot;
                 Skinner avoided shaking Sous&egrave;'s outstretched limp-wristed
            hand, barely touching the tips of his fingers to his palm. Egbert
            also concocted an ill-advised embezzlement plan (with the complicity
            of his future, dim-witted son-in-law Og Oggilby (Grady Sutton), a
            bank clerk and the fiancee of his lovesick oldest daughter Myrtle
            (Una Merkel)) to temporarily &quot;borrow&quot;
              or steal $500 from the bank (until he could repay the money with
              Og's bonus due in a few days) to invest in worthless stock in the
              questionable and flimsy mining operation known as the Beefsteak
              Mining Company - offered by charlatan con J. Frothingham Waterbury
              (Russell Hicks). To convince Og, Egbert told him: &quot;Surely,
              don't be a luddie-duddie, don't be a moon-calf, don't be a jabbernow,
            you're not those, are you?&quot; During Egbert's
            work as a vigilant bank security dick - he choked a young boy in
            a cowboy outfit waving a toy gun - believing that he was a holdup
            man - as the bratty boy walked out of the bank, he ridiculed the
            guard's shiny, bulbous red nose: &quot;Mommy,
              doesn't that man have a funny nose?&quot; His mother chided him
              for making fun: &quot;You mustn't make fun of the gentleman, Clifford.
          You'd like to have a nose like that full of nickels, wouldn't you?&quot; 
		  Souse used knock-out Mickey Finn drinks to hold  off effeminate, 
		  prissy, inquisitive and persistent bank examiner/auditor
              J. Pinkerton Snoopington (Franklin Pangborn) - who was suspicious
          of Egbert's financial dealings. As it turned out,
            the Beefsteak Mine stock was actually valuable, and Waterbury urged
            Egbert to resell him the shares, but before the transaction could
              occur, the second uncaught bank robber Repulsive Rogan (Al Hill)
              returned to rob the bank of mining stock and cash, and took Egbert &quot;hostage.&quot;
              He was forced to drive the getaway car, with the robber in the
              back seat. It was a memorable, zany, slapstick car chase scene
              -  a superbly-timed chase amongst multiple cars (Souse's car was followed
            by the local police, the bank president, and a representative
            from the movie company) that zoomed and circled around, barely
            avoiding crashing into each other or other obstacles in the path. The
            getaway car careened through streets, over ditches (over the heads
            of ditchdiggers), around curves and up a mountainside, missing collisions
            at every turn with the pursuit vehicles. When asked by the thug in
            the back seat to give him the wheel, Egbert matter-of-factly pulled
            it off the steering column and gave it to him. After  the robber
            was struck unconscious by a tree branch and apprehended, Sous&egrave; was
            an unlikely hero once again for thwarting another heist. This time,
            he received $5,000 for capturing the thief, and a film company bought
            his story for $10,000 - funds he used to purchase a top hat and tails,
          and a new mansion, before returning for a visit to the Black Pussy
          Cat Cafe. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Boom Town (1940)</b>, 116 minutes, D: Jack Conway</font><br />
              <font size="2">Director Conway's and MGM's exciting action and
                  western drama was based upon James Edward Grant's short story
                  &quot;A Lady Comes to Burkburnett&quot; that first appeared
                  in <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine.
            	  It marked the third and final pairing of two iconic MGM
                  stars: Gable and Tracy. The story involved a turbulent cycle
                  of partnerships and breakups between two oil-men over their
                  love for the same woman during a 20 year period. It opened
                  in 1918 in a W. Texas oil town during a gunfight, where the
                  two western wild-catters were introduced in their hotel: tough
                  and cocky &quot;Big John&quot; McMasters (Clark Gable) and &quot;Square
                   John&quot; Sand (Spencer Tracy), aka &quot;Shorty.&quot; They
                   were bestowed with their nicknames by the town's saloon girl
                   Whitey (Marion Martin). The two down-on-their-luck men became
                   reluctant partners, and joined together to steal oil drilling
                   equipment from company owner Luther Aldrich (Frank Morgan),
                   to use for their own oil-drilling venture that turned out
                   to be a salt-water bust. Forced to flee and travel to various
                   oil-drilling sites for employment, the men made enough through
                   wild-catting (and McMasters' gambling luck) to partially repay
                   Aldrich. As part of a deal to reimburse Aldrich, they offered
                   him 1/8th of their profits if their new well struck it rich.
                   A new character, quick-witted Eastern-bred schoolteacher Elizabeth
                   'Betsy' Bartlett (Claudette Colbert) showed up, and spurred
                   competition between them for her heart. Although Betsy was
                   Sand's longtime hometown girlfriend, she married McMasters
                   - something that Sand reluctantly permitted in order to keep
                   his friendship. Throughout the film, the two men went through
                   various periods of boom and bust. After a year of marriage,
                   Betsy (accompanied by Sand) caught her drunken husband dancing
                   with barroom floozy Whitey, and decided to leave him. A quarrel
                   between the two alienated men Sand and McMasters ended with
                   a coin-toss for ownership of their oilfields. Sand won the
                   bet, forcing Betsy to forgive her disgraced husband and return
                   to him - although he was no longer permitted on the premises.
                   Fortunes would again change when Sand became a drunkard and
                   sold out his entire business to Aldrich. He moved to the tropics
                   of Latin America, where he again crossed paths with the itinerant,
                   unemployed McMasters and Betsy, who now
            had a young son named Jack. Their petty squabbles were interrupted
            by a Latin American revolution that set fire to Sand's oil wells,
              and he lost everything. In the continuing saga of their
            ups-and-downs fortunes, McMasters became successful on land bought
            in Oklahoma, and then decided to expand  eastward to New York and
            become involved in oil distribution. As a rich oil baron, he  became
            associated with <i>femme fatale</i> Karen Vanmeer (Hedy Lamarr),
             an advisor to his slick former customer Harry Compton
            (Lionel Atwill), who used her sexy wiles to provide Big John with
          industrial secrets about his rival competitors. McMasters began to
              spend all his time with Karen and neglect his family. Although
              Sand lost everything in Latin America, he struck in rich in Oklahoma.
            Eventually, the two men were reconciled at an oilmen's convention
            and they began to work together again. Sand suspected that the long-suffering
            Betsy was unhappy with her unfaithful husband McMasters due to the
            presence of Karen. He proposed a loveless marriage to Karen
            to remove her from McMasters' life, but she rejected his idea
            and vowed to ultimately marry McMasters. Meanwhile, Betsy attempted
              a suicidal drug overdose. Sand took an alternative approach to
              ruining Big John. He teamed with Compton and tried to bankrupt
              his former partner's illegal monopolies, but his efforts backfired
            and he went broke, although McMasters lost $5 million. In the conclusion,
            the two men engaged in a brawling fist-fight after 
            Sand asked McMasters to give his wife a divorce. Karen realized
            that she was causing a rift and decided to leave McMasters.
            McMasters was brought to trial by the government for
            violating the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and was defended by his old
            pal, but still lost his fortune. However, starting over again, Sand
            and McMasters teamed up  in a new wild-catting venture in Kettleman
            Hills, CA - and ultimately would become very rich.</font></p>        </td>

            Arzner<br />
        An early feminist-minded film, and a critical and commercial box-office
        failure, this musical drama was directed by one of the few female Hollywood 
		directors at the time - pioneering butch-lesbian
        Dorothy Arzner (it was regarded as her best film). It also  featured
        one of Lucille Ball's better film roles. It was not to be confused with
        the 1933 film of the same name. This backstage musical was taglined:
          &quot;Heartbreak Behind Gayety of a Girly-Girl Show!&quot; and pitted
          the two dichotomous female leads against each other - a good girl vs.
          bad girl representing two opposite styles of dance (burlesque and ballet).
          Aspiring 'serious' but poor ballerina Judy O'Brien (young Maureen O&rsquo;Hara
          in her third Hollywood film) - an Irish redhead, and her outrageous,
          gold-digging, ambitious friend Bubbles (Lucille Ball) were introduced
          as two chorus girls stranded in Akron, Ohio before they traveled separately
          back to New York City to find work. Bubbles (renamed &quot;Tiger&quot;
          Lily White) became a cheap burlesque stripper in a live show, while
          Judy struggled in dance school with her Russian dance teacher/mentor
          Madame Lydia Basilova (Maria Ouspenskaya). With
          a cruel and cutthroat gesture, Bubbles hired the desperate Judy to
          dance ballet immediately after her own act, knowledgeable that &quot;stooge&quot;
          Judy would be greeted with hostile jeers, boos, and laughter from the
          voyeuristic dirty-old-man audience, and would - of course - demand
          an encore by Bubbles (who only stripped to a hula skirt and bra!).
          Besides an on-stage catfight, the film's most remarkable sequence was
          Judy's celebrated lecture-speech delivered at the climax to the males
          of a jeering burlesque audience who were mocking her classical dance
          act. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Ben Sharpsteen and Disney<br />
            This innovative and revolutionary animated classic from Walt Disney
            (his third feature animation), combined classical music masterpieces
            with imaginative visuals - presented with conductor Leopold Stokowski
            and the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was the first commercial American
            film to use stereophonic sound as well as the first and only film
            recorded in pioneering Fantasound. An updated version was created
            almost 60 years later, <i>Fantasia/2000
            (1999)</i> - the first feature length animated film to be presented
            in IMAX, with additional animated interpretations of classical works,
            including Beethoven's &quot;Symphony No. 5,&quot; Gershwin's &quot;Rhapsody
            in Blue,&quot; Saint-Sa&euml;ns' &quot;Carnival
            of Animals,&quot; and Stravinsky's &quot;The Firebird Suite.&quot; The
            eight animation sequences in this film, corresponding to classical
            music selections, were colorful, impressive, free-flowing, abstract,
            and often surrealistic pieces. They included the most famous of all:
             Paul Dukas' &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; with
            Mickey Mouse (in a comeback role) as the title character - the wizard's
            disobedient assistant who was battling brooms carrying endless buckets
            of water. Also Bach's &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,&quot; Tchaikovsky's 
            &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; with sugar plum fairies and dancing mushrooms,
            prehistoric dinosaurs and volcanoes in Stravinsky's &quot;Rite
            of Spring,&quot; Beethoven's &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; with mythical

              minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
            Alfred Hitchcock's second American film was this thrilling and suspenseful espionage
            masterpiece. A naive American police crime-reporter, Johnny Jones/Huntley
            Haverstock (Joel McCrea), the foreign correspondent of the title
            (loosely based upon real-life reporter Ed Murrow), was sent to Europe
            in 1939 just prior to the outbreak of war in Europe, to cover the
            unfolding story. He met leading peace activist Stephen Fisher (Herbert
            Marshall), fell for his attractive daughter Carol (Laraine Day),
            accidentally became involved chasing spies, and began to suspect
            that Fisher was part of a Nazi spy ring (masquerading as an international
            peace organization). Memorable scenes included the faked Amsterdam
            assassination scene of Dutch diplomat Van Meer (Albert Bassermann)
            in a crowded sea of umbrellas during a rain storm in a large public
            square, the mysterious Dutch windmills (Nazi hideouts) in the countryside,
            a murder attempt and spectacular fall at Westminster Cathedral Tower,
            and a thrilling trans-Atlantic ocean <i>Clipper</i> plane
            crash during which Fisher sacrificed his life after his Nazi ties
            were uncovered. The most memorable scenes accounted for much of the
            budget of $1.5 million dollars, for the visual design and recreation
            of the background scenery and the airplane crash effects. It was
            revealed by the film's end that diplomat Van Meer had been kidnapped
            by the Nazis (who staged his murder and had murdered an identical
            double), to try to extract from him a memorized secret clause 27
            in an Allied treaty for his country -

            The film concluded with Jones' memorable radio speech/plea for neutrality-leaning
            America to join the war effort.</font></p></td>

            Director John Ford's powerful, classic socio-dramatic masterpiece
            was adapted from John Steinbeck's 1939 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.
            It was reputedly regarded as Henry Fonda's greatest film role. It
            told the epic, but heartbreaking story of the perilous, Depression-Era
            migration of a drought-stricken, Oklahoma Dust Bowl family to the
            promised land of California, seeking migrant farm work during the
            fruit harvest. Cinematography by Gregg Toland duplicated images immortalized
            by documentary photographer Dorothea Lange. When they reached California,
            they were met with violence, prejudice, and fear, moving from one
            squalid campsite to the next, and were usually mistreated as migrant
            laborers. It included  magnificent performances of the family
            members who were poor but honest people struggling for dignity and
            a better way of life, especially the idealistic son Tom Joad (Henry
            Fonda) and his loving matriarchal Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) (with her
            famed &quot;We're the people&quot; monologue).</font></p></td>

              Charles Chaplin<br />
            This was actor/director Charles Chaplin's first full talking feature
            film in which he delivered spoken lines - a full 13 years after the
            advent of sound in the movies. The film was a slapstick political
            satire on world conditions and fascism at the start of World War
            II, and it was soon detested by Hitler's Third Reich. Chaplin played
            a dual role: as a poor and kind, unnamed Jewish ghetto barber with
            amnesia, and as a Hitler look-alike - the ruthless tyrannical dictator
            Adenoid Hynkel of the European country of Tomainia who persecuted
            Jews. The criss-crossing stories of the barber and the dictator eventually
            ended in a case of role reversal and mistaken identities. The barber
            won the admiration of pretty neighbor girl Hannah (Chaplin's wife
            at the time Paulette Goddard). Hynkel's rival was Mussolini-like
            Benzino Napaloni (Jack Oakie) of the neighboring country of Bacteria.
            Its most memorable scenes included the funny pudding-coin scene,
            the  scene of Hynkel dancing (&quot;pas de deux&quot;)
            with an inflated world globe balloon to the tune of the Overture
            of Richard Wagner's <i>Lohengrin</i>,
            and the competition  between Hynkel and Napaloni
             in adjoining, ascending barber chairs, followed by a comedic food
            fight. The comedy concluded with a lengthy and impassioned humanistic
            monologue by the barber (appearing like Hynkel) about hope and human
            rights, and the end of tyranny.</font></p></td>

            This classic film (aka <i>The Biography of a Bumb</i>) debuted
            the talents of screwball comedy director and screenwriter Preston
            Sturges (with an Oscar-winning original script). The dramatic comedy
            took a witty, satirical, and cynical look at corrupt American politics
            and society, told with a stock cast of comical characters. In flashback,
            a banana republic bartender, Dan McGinty (Brian Donlevy) told the
            story of his rise from obscurity to the state governor's mansion
            as the result of a crooked election and lots of dirty tricks. Starting
            out as a dumb and homeless hobo in Chicago, he was admired by the
            Boss (Akim Tamiroff), head of the political machine, for his feisty
            nature and for stuffing the ballot box with phony votes. By playing
            the game crookedly, he was appointed collector of protection money,
            then as alderman, and through charm and more appointments, became
            the mayor and eventually governor (the Great McGinty). Along the
            way, when he cleaned up his act and became honest - there were reverse
            consequences. He married his divorcee secretary Catherine (Muriel
            Angelus) - and then fell in love with her and her ready-made family
            of two children, developed a social conscience, and lost it all.
            He suffered a political demise when he tried to go straight, fight
            corruption and promote real reform as governor - opposed by the Boss
            - and had to flee the country. [Note: Brian Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff
            reprised their roles as Governor McGinty and The Boss in Preston

            This classic comedy was one of the earliest and best of Howard Hawks'
            madcap comedies with fast pacing, whirlwind, rapid-fire dialogue,
          and sped-up action. It was a funny
          and witty remake of the 1929 Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur stage
          play hit <i>The Front Page </i>(and the subsequent film <i>The Front Page (1931)</i>), but
          switched gender roles so that the reporter was played by a woman. It
          was remade as director Billy Wilder's <i>The
            Front Page (1974)</i> with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, and as director Ted Kotcheff's <i>Switching
              Channels (1988)</i> within a TV news environment. 
            In the plot, newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell)
              wanted to leave the paper to find a more domestic and less frantic
              life style, and marry  mild-mannered, stuffy mama's boy insurance
              agent Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). But her suave, scheming newspaper
              editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant), her ex-husband, wanted to keep
              her working as his star reporter. When a hot-breaking escaped convict/manhunt
              story developed and she was called upon to cover the story and
              write the front-page headline scoop, he attempted to win her back

            RKO's acclaimed romantic melodrama (a classic &quot;chick flick&quot;),
            subtitled &quot;The Natural History of a Woman,&quot; featured dancer
            Ginger Rogers in her first serious acting role in one of the best &quot;women's
                pictures&quot; of the 40s. It was a touching and poignant love story/soap
                opera, told mostly in flashback. It was adapted with a screenplay
                by Dalton Trumbo that was based on Christopher Morley's 1939
                best-selling popular novel (which contained more racy material,
                including explicit sexuality and an abortion). In the plot, an
                ambitious, attractive white-collar working girl-secretary, Kitty
                Foyle (Best Actress-winning Ginger Rogers) found herself in a
                love triangle with a noble, but poor, idealistic and struggling

                philandering ex-husband, rich Philadelphia socialite Wynnewood
                'Wyn' Strafford VI (Dennis Morgan) whom she was strangely drawn
                to. Her reflections on her choice of beaux (wealth vs. poverty)
                were told through flashback. The film also used a technique of
                a 'mirror-image' conscience to show two sides of Kitty's personality
                (the rational vs. the emotional and impulsive) during her dilemma.
                Caught in a difficult love triangle, she had to choose in the
                final scene: (1) should she go with Wyn who was on the dock ready
                to sail for South America?, or (2) should she join Mark at the
                hospital? She decided to marry Mark after she said to herself: &quot;You're
                no longer a little girl, you're a grown woman now.&quot; She
                left a note with the doorman regarding her choice of life's path:

            Director Lloyd Bacon's sentimental, inspirational sports biography-drama
            was about Notre Dame's legendary and dedicated football coach, who
            became known for rousing pep talks to his players, exhorting them
            to greatness. It has become one of the best sports movies of all-time.
            The film began with Knute Rockne's (Pat O'Brien) boyhood, his schooling
            and football days at Notre Dame, graduation, marriage to Bonnie Skiles
            (Gale Page), and the start of his coaching career for the Fighting
            Irish. The film contained actual newsreel footage of Notre Dame football
            games, and was most-remembered for Rockne's stirring words to his
            team during half-time in a game against Army to &quot;go out there with

              minutes, D: William Wyler<br />
            Director William Wyler's superb melodrama from Warner Bros. was adapted
            from the 1927 W. Somerset Maugham play of the same name. The story
            was filmed once before as the silent <i>The
            Letter (1929)</i> with Jeanne Eagels,
            and remade as <i>The Unfaithful (1947)</i>, starring Ann Sheridan.
            Director Wyler was again paired with actress Bette Davis, after their
            success with <i><a href="jeze.html">Jezebel (1938)</a>.</i> On the
            grounds of a Malayan rubber plantation one evening, bored and restless
            wife Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis) shot and point-blank killed old
            family friend Geoffrey Hammond (David Newell) on the porch and front
            steps of her home with her husband's gun - in the striking opening
            scene. She explained to her husband Robert (Herbert Marshall) (who
            was away on business at the time of the murder) and their hired respected
            lawyer Howard Joyce (James Stephenson), with cold calculation and
            manipulation, that it was self-defense to protect her honor. Her
            husband faithfully believed her. She claimed that Hammond, who was
            married to an Eurasian - Mrs. Hammond (Gale Sondergaard), had tried
            to rape her. She was to stand trial in Singapore for murder. [Note:
            In fact, she killed him because as her lover, he threatened to leave
            her to take another partner.] During the proceedings, clerk Ong Chi
            Seng (Victor Sen Yung) presented her lawyer Joyce with a copy of
            an incriminating letter written from murderess Leslie to Geoffrey
            on the day of the shooting, desperately asking to see him. The letter
            was in the possession of Hammond's widow, who blackmailed them by
            offering to sell it for $10,000 (all of Robert's savings). Leslie
            tearfully admitted her affair with Hammond. The letter had to be
            retrieved personally in a dramatic scene. During the subsequent court
            trial, Leslie was found innocent of murder charges, because the incriminating
            evidence wasn't produced. Leslie's lawyer told the jury it was &quot;a
            simple, uncomplicated case&quot; - after she again claimed she shot Hammond in self-defense. However,
            on the night of the acquittal in the film's conclusion, Leslie suffered
            a fateful retribution when she was knifed in the
            dark by Mrs. Hammond. According to the Hays Code, she had to pay
            and be punished for her indiscretion.</font></p>        </td>

            Director John Ford's war drama was adapted from four short, one-act
            plays by Eugene O'Neill that were condensed into one screenplay.
            It included atmospheric, high-contrast, black and white cinematography
            by the famous Gregg Toland. This was Ford's first war film - and
            first WWII film (he later directed <i>They
            Were Expendable (1945)</i>). In a series of vignettes, set
             in pre-World War II year of 1939, the gripping film took a look
            at the lives and loves, hopes, dreams, and comradeship of working-class
            Merchant Marine seamen. Their British freighter, the <i>S.S.
            Glencairn</i>, was transporting dynamite in a dangerous mission-convoy
            from America to England, and was threatened by bad weather at sea,
            German U-boats and strafing plane attacks, the death of beloved crew
            member Yank (Ward Bond), and suspicions of treason against Smitty
            (Ian Hunter), one of the sailors. Young Swedish sailor and farm-boy
            Ole Olsen (John Wayne) was returning home to his mother's farm-home,
            with fellow seamate Aloysius Driscoll (Thomas Mitchell).
            An epilogue ended the film: &quot;So
            men like Ole come and go, and the Driscolls live and die, and
            the Yanks and Smittys leave their memories - but for the others

              Mamoulian<br />
            Director Mamoulian's very popular, major B/W swashbuckling adventure
            story from 20th Century Fox was a remake of the  silent costume-drama
            classic <i>The Mark of Zorro (1920) </i>with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.
            It capitalized on the adventure tale craze perpetuated by other very
            popular Fairbanks' swashbucklers in the 1920s, including <i>The Three
            Musketeers (1921), Robin Hood (1922), Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925),
            The Black Pirate (1926), </i>and<i> The Iron
            Mask (1929)</i>. Around the time of the success of <i><a href="adve.html">The Adventures
            of Robin Hood (1938)</a></i>, there were also two routine, low-budget
            Republic Pictures serials: the 12-part <i>Zorro
            Rides Again (1937)</i> and <i>Zorro's Fighting Legion (1939)</i>.
            Later, the Zorro tale became a 1957-1959 TV
            series (by Walt Disney) starring Guy Williams as Don Diego, and it
            was also remade as <i>The Mask of Zorro (1998) </i>and the follow-up <i>The
            Legend of Zorro (2005), </i>both  with Antonio Banderas and Catherine
            Zeta-Jones. In this film's plot, cavalry officer Don Diego Vega (Tyrone
            Power), the son of an early 19th century S. California wealthy aristocrat
            Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), returned home to Alta, California
            after a military academy education in Madrid, Spain (where he had
            been dubbed the &quot;California
              cockerel&quot; for his horsemanship and swordsman skills). He 
              found that power had been usurped from his ex-Alcade father by
              corrupt oppressors led by the new Alcade, Don Luis Quintero (J.
              Edward Bromberg) and his tax-collecting henchman led by the lethal
            and evil Capt. Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). By
            day, nobleman-aristocrat Diego adopted the persona of a carefree,
            harmless, effeminate and foppish-looking fool or dandy (with a snuff
            box and lacy handkerchief), but at night he became a saving
			 &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and/or &quot;Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;
          figure. He donned a black outfit, a mask and
          a sword, and as an outlaw, he rode on his black horse Tornado to avenge
          the tyrants, and to carve the letter Z into many surfaces to signify
          his name: Zorro. On the side, Diego  flirted in response to the advances
          of Quintero's greedy wife Inez (Gale Sondergaard), causing some resentment
          by Pasquale who  was also interested in her. Zorro's
          real love interest was provided by Quintero's pretty niece Lolita (Linda
          Darnell), who had prayed to the Virgin Mary for a handsome suitor:
          &quot;Blessed Mother, send someone to take me from this dreary place.
          Someone I can love and respect. Let him be kind and brave. And... handsome,
          please, dear Mother.&quot; Her wish was fulfilled with Diego (as Zorro),
          although at first he was forced to cover his face and disguise himself
          as a monk. She became very distraught when she interacted 
          with Diego as a &quot;popinjay&quot; and was forced to be bethrothed
          to him by her tyrannical uncle. As the film concluded, the cowardly-appearing
          Diego accepted Pasquale's taunting offer of a sword-duel, and they
          engaged in one of the best dueling scenes in cinematic history. As
          the swordplay climaxed, Diego pierced Pasquale with his sword, and
          as he fell, he dislodged a picture hung on the wall, revealing a carved
          &quot;Z&quot; - and his identity as Zorro. In the
          end after escaping from imprisonment, Zorro was able to rally the
          poor peasants, overthrow the cruel regime, marry Lolita, and reinstate
          Zorro's father as governor or Alcalde (leader of the community).</font></p>          </td>

              D: Frank Borzage<br />
              Director Frank Borzage's propagandistic MGM melodrama  was
              a flop at the box-office. It was based upon Phyllis Bottome's best-selling,
              pre-war 1938 novel, about ideological differences dividing up a
              family. The strong anti-fascist and anti-Semite message of the
              anti-Nazi film (one of the first Hollywood films of its kind, released
              a few months before Chaplin's <i><a href="greatdictator.html">The
              Great Dictator (1940)</a></i>) caused it to be banned by the Aryan
              supremacist Nazis in Germany, led by Hitler's propaganda minister
              Joseph Goebbels. It told about the Roth family living idyllically
              and peacefully in the early 1930s in a small fictional Alpine village
              in Southern Germany - and the repercussions after Adolf Hitler
              came to power as Chancellor in the Third Reich in 1933 and Nazism
              slowly pervaded the country. The family was led by outspoken, respected, &quot;non-Aryan&quot; (or
              Jewish) 60 year-old teacher of biology Viktor Roth (Frank Morgan)
              at a Bavarian educational institution. Pretty daughter Freya Roth
              (Margaret Sullavan) was courted by young fascist Fritz Marberg
              (Robert Young), one of her father's students, but then rejected
              him in favor of more sensitive rival Martin Brietner (James Stewart),
              a long-time family friend, and Roth's protege as a pacifist veterinary
              student. Two Roth stepsons, Otto (Robert Stack) and Erich (William
              T. Orr), both supported the rise of Hitler and the Hitler Youth
              Organization, causing more friction and a rift in the family. When
              Professor Roth opposed the Nazi doctrines about racial segregation
              and a master race of Aryans, he was removed from his position,
              arrested and sent to a hard labor concentration camp, where he
              died under mysterious circumstances. In the grim conclusion, Martin
              aided Freya in an attempt to escape from Germany by crossing the
              border into Austria - by skiing through a mountainous snowy pass,
              where they were spotted by a Nazi platoon patrol led by Fritz.
              Although they were able to cross the border successfully, Freya
              was mortally wounded and died in Martin's arms. </font></p>        </td>

              Kanin<br />
            Director Kanin's  classic marital screwball comedy featured the tagline:
            &quot;The funniest, fastest honeymoon ever screened!&quot; It had
            all the characteristics of screwball comedy - fast paced dialogue,
            absurd and wacky circumstances, and some slapstick. It was
            an attempt to repeat the success of director Leo McCarey's <i><a href="awfu.html">The
              Awful Truth (1937)</a></i> (featuring the same two stars and
            producer McCarey). It was the second of three films which paired
            Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, followed by <i>Penny Serenade (1941)</i>.
            It was to be remade as <i>Something's Gotta Give (1962) </i> with
            Marilyn Monroe (who died before completion), and officially remade
            as <i>Move Over, Darling (1963)</i> with Doris Day and James Garner.
            In the opening court scene, Judge Bryson (Granville Bates)
            declared that young 'widowed' attorney Nick Arden's (Cary Grant)
            wife of seven years, Ellen Wagstaff Arden (Irene Dunne), was presumed
            lost and declared legally dead after a seven year absence (and presumed
            drowned in the South Pacific Ocean during a typhoon). Immediately,
            Nick was allowed to remarry bride Bianca Bates (Gail
            Patrick). Suddenly and to everyone's surprise, Ellen  
            reappeared at her home after seven years, where she spoke to her
            two young children who didn't know her, Tim (Scott Beckett) and Chinch
            (Mary Lou Harrington), and Nick's mother Ma (Ann Shoemaker). She
            learned it was the day of her husband Nick's  remarriage to Bianca
            and their honeymoon night, spent at Yosemite Park lodge. As he entered
            an elevator in the lodge, Nick caught a surprise glimpse of his first
            wife Ellen in the lobby (tracking him down), supposedly legally dead
            - however, she had been rescued by a Portuguese freighter, and was
            trying to locate him (at the same locale where they had honeymooned
            seven years earlier). In a series of funny circumstances at the hotel,
            Nick tried to keep Ellen a secret from his second wife, by ordering
            a second room, Suite 'A' for her. After the honeymoon ended, Nick
            was having trouble telling the truth to Bianca (&quot;My wife's come
            back&quot;), and Ellen  tormented and humiliated Nick and
            Bianca by pretending to be a Southern-accented, obnoxious visiting
            friend of the family. Soon, Nick became jealous when he learned that
            Ellen had not been alone on the desert island. She had been marooned
            with another survivor, handsome young scientist Stephen Burkett (Randolph
            Scott), who was discovered to be a virile,
            health-nut and athletic diver and pool swimmer at the posh Pacific
            Club. Nick was stunned - what was he to do,
            and what about the other man who may have compromised her? Ellen
            unsuccessfully tried to fool Nick by recruiting a mousy, bald-headed
            shoe salesman (Chester Clute) to claim that he was her &quot;Adam&quot; character
            while they were on the island. In the same courtroom from earlier,
            the Judge annulled Nick's second marriage, and Bianca punched Nick
            in the face. Although Ellen kept denying any fidelity, Nick kept
            believing that she had been unfaithful. In their mountain cabin,
            Ellen told her still non-committal husband Nick, who was sleeping
            in a separate bed, to think things over by taking a sixty-day cruise
            and coming back around Christmas-time. In the final scene in the
            cabin, Nick thought of a number of strategies to reconcile himself
            with Ellen. He returned dressed up as Santa Claus to join her in
            her bedroom rather than sleep separately in the attic, and pulled
            down his fake beard to wish her a &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot;</font></p>          </td>

          Edward Cline's western comedy marked the only film pairing both W.C.
              Fields and Mae West. It was filmed with the backdrop of the 1880s
              American West, and opened with Chicago singer Flower
              Belle Lee (Mae West) journeying westward to see her relatives in
              the town of Little Bend - her Aunt Lou (Ruth Donnelly) and Uncle
              John (Willard Robertson). During her stagecoach ride,  
              a gold shipment was held up by a Zorro-like &quot;Masked Bandit&quot;,
              and Flower Belle was abducted on horseback. She later had a nocturnal
              rendezvous with her kidnapper - and continued to romance him. As
              a result, Flower Belle was expelled from Little Bend by a judge
              (Addison Richards) for her indifference, sauciness and her illicit
              relationship. She was told she could return only if she was &quot;respectable
              and married.&quot; On the train to Greasewood City, she met con-man
              Cuthbert J. Twillie (W. C. Fields). During  an
            Indian attack on the train - with arrows whizzing by Flower Belle,
            she fired back with two six-shooters. Afterwards, believing he was
            rich after eyeing his bag full of money (it only contained phony
            oil-well coupons), Flower Belle accepted Twillie's proposal of marriage
            - with a roll of her eyes:  &quot;I'll take you, and how.&quot; They
            were married  aboard the train in a phony
            sham ceremony officiated by one of the passengers Amos Budge (Donald
            Meek). In Greasewood City, Flower Belle insisted that they
            have separate rooms when they checked into the hotel. Due to his
            boasting and bravado, Twillie was made Sheriff by the corrupt town
            boss and saloon owner Jeff Badger (Joseph Calleia), who was competing
            for Flower Belle's love and knew that previous Sheriffs had suffered
            a high mortality rate. Flower Belle became the town's schoolteacher
            for a rowdy class of schoolboys. Twillie was frustrated in continued
            attempts to 'consummate' his marriage to Flower Belle, and once found
            himself making love to a goat in their bed. When Twillie was accused
            of being the Masked Bandit (a disguise he used to trick her and get
            into her boudoir) after an unfamiliar kiss with Flower Belle gave
            him away, he was strung up by a lynch mob and delivered his last
            wish: (&quot;I'd like to see Paris before I die. Philadelphia will do&quot;). When
            Flower Belle went to Badger to help rescue Twillie from death, she
            kissed him and realized he was the true Masked Bandit (&quot;That
            man's kiss is like a signature&quot;); Twillie was saved from hanging
            by Flower Belle's intervention (she shot at the noose-rope). It was
            also revealed to the townsfolk that Badger was the Masked Bandit,
            and Twillie was released. At the conclusion,
            Flower Belle told other possible suitors: &quot;Any
              time you got nothin' to do and lots of time to do it, come up.&quot;
              Both of the main stars exchanged trademarked quips. Twillie delivered
              his last line to Flower Belle as he left town to go East to attend
              to his &quot;hair&quot; oil wells: &quot;If you get up around the Grampian Hills, <u>you must
              come up and see me sometime</u>&quot; (Mae West's signature line).
            She responded: &quot;Aw, yeah, yeah, <u>I'll do that, my little chickadee</u>&quot;
          (W.C. Fields' catchphrase). In the camera's last image -- as Flower
          Belle sashayed her bottom to ascend the stairs, the words &quot;THE
        END&quot; were super-imposed on her rear end. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Our Town (1940),</b> 90 minutes, D: Sam Wood<br />
            Director Sam Wood's much-loved classic, dramatic story told about
                human life, love, tragedy and conflict. It featured a great
              musical score by composer Aaron Copland, and production design
              by William Cameron Menzies. It was
                an innovative filmed presentation of Thornton Wilder's 1938 Pulitzer
                Prize-winning play. In contrast to the
                play that was performed without scenery and only a few props,
                the film included realistic scenery - and a changed conclusion.
                The story was set in the simple, small New England town of Grover's
                Corners, NH, and was told in three sequences depicting the years
                before WWI (1901, 1904, and 1913). The film
              opened with a prologue given by the omnicient Stage Manager (Frank
                Craven), a guide who provided down-home commentary as the film's
                narrator, profiling the lives of the town's residents  - he 
                also served as the town's drugstore owner Mr. Morgan (Frank Craven).
                The plot was centered, in the first segment (in the year 1901),
                around young, pretty, bright, teenaged Emily Webb (Martha Scott,
                25 years of age at the time of filming), the hard-working daughter
                of the town's newspaper editor Mr. Webb (Guy Kibbee) and his
                wife Julie (Fay Bainter). Emily fell in love with baseball-playing,
                16 year-old high-school student George Gibbs (William Holden),
                son of the local doctor, Dr. Gibbs (Thomas Mitchell). They courted
                each other over a period of about three years. Then in the film's
                second segment (in the year 1904) about love and marriage, the
                two prepared to be wed. In the third segment (in the year 1913),
                set in the cemetery of Grover's Corners, it was told that Emily
                passed away during the childbirth for her second child. In a
                ghostly, in-between afterlife existence, Emily was given special
                permission to go back and re-live just one day of her life -
                the day of her 16th birthday (her 12th birthday in the play).
                Wearing white and often transparent in the company of others,
                she profoundly learned how the quiet, little, everyday, fleeting
                moments of life were precious - fast-moving and under-appreciated.
                In the twist ending epilogue (a severe modification from the
                play's original downbeat ending), Emily repetitively spoke: &quot;I
                want to live&quot; - she woke up from the temporary coma resulting
                from childbirth, and had survived the birth. She realized the
                film's third episode was just a dream or hallucination. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: George Cukor<br />
            Director George Cukor's classic, sophisticated romantic comedy (with
            some screwball elements) was a witty and articulate adaptation of
            Phillip Barry's 1939 Broadway hit. Actress Katharine Hepburn financed
            the play (with additional support from Howard Hughes) that she would
            star in (with Joseph Cotten and Van Heflin) in 1939-1940, then picked
            the director, screenwriter, and other co-stars for the movie version.
            The film won a compensatory Best Actor-Oscar for James Stewart, and
            Best Adapted Screenplay. The film revived Hepburn's film career at
            the start of the 1940s, and  erased her reputation as &quot;box-office
            poison.&quot; The story was remade as a musical, <i>High
            Society (1956)</i> with Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby.
            All of the action in the film occurred in the 24-hour period before
            the female protagonist's second wedding. Set amongst the upper class
            society in Philadelphia, a spoiled, intelligent, arrogant wealthy
            heiress, Tracy Samantha Lord (Katharine Hepburn) was about to be
            married, in a major societal wedding at the Lord's estate, to stuffy,
            self-important, executive millionaire George Kittredge (John Howard).
            Two years earlier, she had divorced her dashing, wealthy first husband
            C. K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) because he drank excessively and
            she was contemptuous of his irresponsible behavior. However, Dexter
            still loved Tracy and showed up in attendance at the wedding. Behind
            the scenes, Dexter had arranged for an exclusive, inside-story expose
            on the wedding to <i>Spy</i> magazine publisher
              Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell), in exchange for preventing 
              the publication of a second, scandalous expose about the womanizing
              reputation (an affair with a dancer) of Tracy's father Seth (John
              Halliday), his ex-in-law. (Tracy resented her father Seth for being
               estranged from her mother Margaret (Mary Nash), but also didn't
              want the family's reputation sullied.) Therefore, Dexter was able
              to allow the presence of two <i>Spy Magazine</i> employees at the
              pre-wedding festivities: sardonic, scandal-tabloid reporter Macauley
              (&quot;Mike&quot;) Connor
            (Best Actor-winning James Stewart) and photographer Elizabeth (&quot;Liz&quot;)
            Imbrie (Ruth Hussey), who was in love with Mike. Things became very
            complicated when the inquisitive, cynical reporter Connor began to
            fall in love (or infatuation) after becoming bedazzled by Tracy.
            A romantic triangle developed between Tracy and her three suitors:
            Kittredge, Mike, and Dexter. Mike expressed his romantic interest
            in her the evening before her marriage when he suggested that she
            shouldn't marry Kittredge, and shared a possibly-scandalous, but
            innocent moonlight swim with the slightly inebriated Tracy. The morning
            of the wedding ceremony, Tracy awoke with a hangover and no recollection
            of the previous night's escapades. A belligerent Kittredge was incensed
              after hearing and witnessing Tracy's compromised behavior when
              she was drunk. Sensing that Kittredge was also not a good match
              for her, Tracy called off her wedding to him, and also deflected
              Mike's interest in stepping forward as a new bridegroom. She ultimately
              decided to remarry Dexter and rekindle their past loving relationship. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske and Disney<br />
            Walt Disney's second full-length animated feature film, a brilliant
            classic based on the children's story by Carlo Collodi, was a masterful,
            animated achievement. It was released the same year as Disney's <i><a href="fant.html">Fantasia
            (1940)</a></i>.  The charming storybook animated tale was narrated
            by a chirpy cricket named Jiminy Cricket (voice
            of Cliff Edwards), who served as the guiding conscience
            of the story (&quot;Give a Little Whistle&quot;). Although designed
            for youngsters, the animation included some truly frightening sequences.
             Jiminy opened the film by singing Oscar-winning Best Song &quot;When
            You Wish Upon a Star.&quot; The
            plot (revealed by opening a fanciful storybook) told about a lonely,
            kindly, poor, toy shop puppetmaker and woodcutter Geppetto (voice
            of Christian Rub) who created an inquisitive marionette wooden boy
            named Pinocchio (voice of Dick Jones). Other companions were black-and-white
            kitten Figaro and Cleo the goldfish. His life-long wish was that
            Pinocchio would become a real boy. It came true by the interventions
            of a Blue Fairy in the workshop during the night, although the transformed
            alive boy was still made of wood. If he proved himself to be brave,
            truthful and unselfish (challenged by life's coming-of-age dangers),
            he would be changed into a real flesh-and-blood boy. Pinocchio quickly
            ran afoul on his way to school by associating with bad company, including
            the unforgettable characters of two devious con-crooks (J. Worthington
            Foulfellow (a sly fox) and his mute companion cat named Gideon),
            and was convinced to give up on schooling and pursue a life on stage
            (&quot;Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee (An Actor's Life for Me&quot;). Pinocchio
            was introduced and sold to  evil, Italian
            stage showman/puppet master Stromboli, where he performed on-stage
            in a puppet show with the song: &quot;I've Got No Strings.&quot; In
            the evenings, Pinocchio was locked up in a birdcage to keep him imprisoned.
            Stromboli's objective was to tour with Pinocchio around the world
            and then chop him up into firewood. During another appearance of
            the Blue Fairy, Pinocchio lied about why he wasn't in school and
            his nose grew as he told more deceits - until it became as long as
            a tree branch where birds could perch. Pinocchio was given a second
            chance and freed. But again, Pinocchio was led astray by Foulfellow
            and Gideon, and transported by a &quot;Coachman&quot;
            to Pleasure Island (without rules or authority figures), where  temptations
            abounded. Pinocchio and other young boys were encouraged to
            misbehave, gamble, drink, play pool, vandalize and smoke cigars.
            Pinocchio became friends with influential
            juvenile delinquent Lampwick, who due to his misbehavior, was transformed
            into a braying donkey (with ears, hooves, and a tail) as punishment
            for his bad behavior.  He frantically cried out for his Momma 
            - the donkeys  were ultimately to be sold as slave-labor pack
            animals (jack-asses) in the salt mines or in circuses. Fearing
            for his own life when Pinocchio began to grow large ears and a tail,
            he was able to escape from the island with Jiminy's assistance. In
            the workshop, the two learned that Geppetto had gone looking for
            Pinocchio to rescue him, and on a raft-sailboat at sea, Geppetto
            was swallowed by the scary Monstro, the Whale, and was alive in Monstro's
            cavernous belly. Pinocchio managed to be swallowed to reunite with
            his father, and then schemed to light a fire inside the whale to
            force them to be expelled with a giant sneeze. They were propelled
            out of the whale's mouth, and escaped on their raft from the angry's
            whale's pursuit. The self-sacrificing Pinocchio saved his father
            from drowning, but ended up appearing dead on the shore. Back at
            home, Pinocchio was magically resurrected by the Blue Fairy for his
            good deeds, and rewarded for proving himself by being transformed
            into a real boy (&quot;Awake,
            Pinocchio&quot;). In the conclusion,
            Jiminy Cricket was also rewarded with a gold badge by the Blue Fairy
            for serving as Pinocchio's conscience. </font></p>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Pride and Prejudice (1940),</b> 117 minutes, D:
              Robert Z. Leonard<br />
            MGM's and director Robert Z. Leonard's dramatic, witty
            comedy (or parody) of manners, customs and morals of the aristocratic
            way of country life for the landed gentry in  the early to mid-19th
            century pre-Victorian England, was adapted from Jane Austen's 1813
            novel, with a screenplay partially written by author Aldous Huxley.
            It was lavishly produced as a period costume folly, and since has
            been remade many times, most notably Joe Wright's <i>Pride &amp; Prejudice
            (2005, UK)</i> with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. The central
            family was composed of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet (Edmund
            Gwenn and Mary Boland) who lived in a country farm home in Longbourn,
            and shopped and socialized while shopping in the village of Meryton.
            The parents, particularly the distressed, busybody and agitated Mrs.
            Bennet, were very anxious to marry off their five eligible but undoweried
            daughters - the eldest, overly-spirited, strong-willed, witty and
            opinionated Elizabeth (Greer Garson), lovely and gentle Jane (Maureen
            O'Sullivan), Lydia (Ann Rutherford), Kitty (Heather Angel), and Mary
            (Marsha Hunt). Each girl had her own peculiarities - flirtatious,
            silly, serious, bookish, plain, lovely, and gentle. In those days,
            girls were doomed to spinsterhood (and possible pennilessness) if
            they couldn't find an eligible man to marry and support them (&quot;Look
            at them! Five of them without dowries&quot;). And in particular,
            the Bennets could only pass on their fortune to their daughters through
            a male heir. The only sole heir at the present time was Mr. Bennet's
            distant cousin - boring and pompous Mr. Collins (Melville Cooper),
            who would obtain Longbourn if no male heir was produced. Fortunes
            looked favorable when some wealthy, eligible young bachelors rented
            the local Netherfield Park - a neighboring vast country house for
            the season, including Mr. Bingley (Bruce Lester) (and his sister
            Caroline Bingley (Frieda Inescort)) and their handsome but arrogant,
            boorish and condescending friend Mr. Darcy (Laurence Olivier). An
            opportunity for the daughters to meet the neighborhood's new residents
            occurred at the big social event - the Assembly Ball. Mr. Bingley
            courted Jane, while independent-minded Miss Elizabeth rejected Darcy's
            invitation to dance due to his prideful, mean and uncivil nature
            comments about the lowly middle-class, and specifically his treatment
            of one of the attendees, Mr. George Wickham (Edward Ashley), a boyhood
            friend of Darcy's. To spite Darcy for being harsh, Elizabeth accepted
            Wickham's dance request instead. Later, the shrewd Mrs. Bennet schemed
            to deliberately cause Jane to catch a bad cold when she encouraged
            her daughter to ride on horseback to Netherfield to attend a tea
            invitation. Jane was ordered by the doctor to remain for a week to
            recuperate, and Elizabeth was also sent to help her convalesce. Although
            Jane soon recovered and grew closer to Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth mostly
            was involved in an emotional stand-off against Mr. Darcy during her
            stay. Knowing that Elizabeth was failing with Mr. Darcy, Mrs. Bennet
            suggested that Elizabeth offer herself as a suitable wife for Mr.
            Collins -
            but she was aghast at the idea and spurned his company. Darcy noticed
            Elizabeth's distaste for Mr. Collins and helped her to avoid his
            pursuit after her through the garden during a gathering with the
            Bingleys at Netherfield. Elizabeth noticed and thanked Darcy for
            the assistance - and they began to develop a difficult but contrary
            romance. Later at the same garden party, Mrs. Bennet embarrassingly
            bragged about Jane's romantic success with Mr. Bingley (&quot;Wasn't
            it clever of me to send her over in the rain? And, of course, dear
            Jane will see that the other girls have the opportunity of meeting
            all sorts of rich young men&quot;). After the Bingleys departed from
            Netherfield to return to London, Jane received a note suggesting
            that Mr. Bingley was going to propose to Darcy's sister, instead
            of to her - and she was devastated by the news. Elizabeth's earlier
            opinions about Bingley and Darcy seemed to be confirmed and justified.
            Many months later, Elizabeth met again with Darcy while she was visiting
            her best friend Charlotte Lucas (Marjorie Wood) who had just become
            Mr. Collins' newly-wed wife. At Rosings - the estate home of wealthy
            Lady Catherine de Brough (Edna May Oliver), where Collins was employed
            by his &quot;patroness,&quot;
              Elizabeth re-established a connection with Darcy, and he made a
              surprise proposal to her in condescending terms. (Moments before
              the marital proposal, Elizabeth heard that
              it was Darcy who had ruined her sister Jane's chances with Mr.
              Bingley.) Elizabeth refused his invitation to marry, and further
              berated him for his continued abusive treatment of people (including
              both Jane and earlier Mr. Wickham). Darcy  quickly bid Elizabeth
              goodbye and left, and she returned to Longbourn. Now at home, Elizabeth
              learned that her unmarried 16 year-old sister Lydia had scandalously
              run away with Mr. Wickham. Darcy reappeared and revealed that Mr.
              Wickham had also run away with his 15 year-old sister Georgiana
              - illustrating to Elizabeth why Darcy hated Wickham so much. Lydia
              could not be found in London, and as the Bennet family prepared
              to leave Longbourn due to the family's disgrace, Mr. Wickham and
              Lydia arrived for a surprise homecoming and announced they had
              been married - and that he had received a major inheritance. The
              family's honor was thankfully restored. At the same time, however,
              the intimidating and haughty dowager Lady Catherine questioned
            Elizabeth's intentions to marry Darcy solely for his inheritance
            - she revealed that as Darcy's aunt (and trustee of his mother's
            estate), she could refuse to allow her nephew to marry Elizabeth.
            Although Elizabeth had no interest in marrying Darcy - due to her
            constant 'pride and prejudice' toward him - she was surprised to
            learn that Darcy still loved her. To her shock, she also realized
            that Darcy had been the one who provided Wickham with a paid income
            that allowed him to marry Lydia. All along, it seemed that Elizabeth
            had misread Darcy's character. Lady Catherine was made aware that
            Elizabeth was not a fortune hunter, and would be a good personality
            match for Darcy - and she told him: &quot;She's right for you, Darcy.
             You were a spoiled child. But, we don't want to go on spoiling you!
            What you need is a woman who will stand up to you. I think you've
            found her!&quot; The conclusion of the film found three of the Bennet
            sisters in love - Bingley who was now reconciled with Jane (due to
            Darcy's and Caroline's intervention), Lydia with her new beau Mr.
            Wickham, and Elizabeth reunited and in love with Darcy. The younger
            two Bennet daughters (Kitty and Mary) would be next, as Mrs. Bennet
            observed in the film's last lines: &quot;Auhh! Think of it! 
            Three of them married. And the other two, just tottering on the
            brink!&quot;</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
            Alfred Hitchcock's debut American film - a winning Best Picture,
            was adapted from British writer Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel of
            gothic romance and atmospheric intrigue  - a compelling
             romance and murder mystery with intense psychological suspense.
            It also won the award for Best B/W Cinematography. The film opened
            with a voice-over flashback - a famous quote: &quot;Last night I dreamt
            I went to Manderley again&quot; - the burned-out ruins of the site (formerly
            an English country mansion) were viewed through dark tree foliage.
            The narrator then began to tell the story
            of &quot;the strange days&quot;  of her life - in flashback. In the plot, after
            a rapid courtship following their first encounter in Monte Carlo,
          a shy, timid, naive, young unnamed woman became the second Mrs. de
          Winter (Joan Fontaine) by marrying a dashing, but brooding British
          aristocrat-nobleman 'Maxim' de Winter (Laurence Olivier), a haunted
          widower. The new wife was taken to live at his huge Manderley country
          mansion-estate in England, where she was continually reminded by the
          memories and shadow of Maxim's beautiful first wife, Rebecca, who died
          under mysterious circumstances. The icy-cold, sinister, creepy housekeeper
          Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) taunted and frightened her, as did the
          other servants, while she continually heard praises and adoration for
          Maxim's former dead wife.  Maxim was also somewhat surly, dispassionate
          toward his wife, and moody (due to his own feelings of guilt and sorrow),
          although later, he appeared to have been misunderstood. She began to
          helplessly misapprehend that Rebecca was a devoted, gracious and loving
          wife for Maxim, and continued to be a rival for her love for Maxim,
          although she was dead and gone. At one point, Mrs. Danvers even went
          so far as to encourage the second Mrs. de Winter to commit suicide
          by jumping from a window. The near-suicide was interrupted by sirens
          signaling the discovery of a boat-wreck. The untold secrets of the
          past were slowly unraveled when the remnants of Rebecca's intentionally-sunken
          boat washed ashore. Her drowned remains were inside the boat, that
          had been sabotaged with holes. Mr. de Winter confessed to his surprised
          wife that Rebecca had forever tormented him in a love-hate relationship,
          with her cleverly manipulative nature and promiscuity. The ending revealed
          important findings: (1) Rebecca was not pregnant with another man's
          child, but terminally ill with inoperable cancer, (2) Rebecca intended
          to goad Maxim into killing her in the boat house, (3) when Maxim wouldn't
          kill her as she wished, she planned to commit suicide, but fell and
          hit her head on some boat tackle in the beachside boat house. (4) Maxim
          covered up her accidental death by putting her in a boat and deliberately
          sinking it. An inquest into the case eventually cleared Maxim from
          any wrong-doing. The second Mrs. de Winter was finally freed from her fears and uneasiness.
          When Maxim returned home from London to Manderley, he found that the
          deranged and malevolent Mrs. Danvers had suicidally burned down the
          estate - and consumed (literally) the haunting memories of the past. The staff and
          the second Mrs. de Winter escaped from 
          the blaze, but Danvers deliberately perished in the flames in Rebecca's
          old bedroom.</font></p>          </td>

            Director Michael Curtiz's action-filled, but historically-inaccurate
            western-adventure tale from WB Studios, was actually misnamed.
            This was the seventh of nine movies co-starring the romantic coupling
            of Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn. The film followed the military
            life of the future great Confederate general, Virginian Jeb Stuart
            (Errol Flynn). He began his military career as a West Point student,
            where he had a strong friendship with George Armstrong Custer (Ronald
            Reagan) (completely inaccurate historically), and other future military
            leaders. There,  rival cadet Rader (Van Heflin), who supported fanatical
            abolitionist activities, was dismissed for agitation - their paths
            would cross again later. Cavalry officer Jeb was  assigned
            to a Kansas post (Ft. Leavenworth) with other Point graduates, to
            keep the peace (due to a war over whether Kansas would be slave or
            free) and quell any uprisings. On the train to Kansas, Stuart met
            and began a romance with 'Kit Carson' Holliday (Olivia de Havilland),
            whom he would eventually marry. The film ended with Stuart capturing
            fanatical abolitionist John Brown (Raymond Massey) at the Harper's
            Ferry arsenal at the Maryland-Virginia border, leading to the lunatic
            agitator's hanging. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Sea Hawk (1940),</b> 109 minutes, D: Michael
              Curtiz<br />
            Director Michael Curtiz's exciting and spirited swashbuckler (with
            great swordplay and sea battles) and escapist film was one of the
            best of its kind. It was adapted from the 1915 novel by Rafael Sabatini,
            and featured a tremendously rousing score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.
            [Note: Sabatini was also the author of the 1921 novel <i>Scaramouche </i>which
            was made into an MGM film in 1952 with Stewart Granger).]
            This film solidified the image of star Errol Flynn as a dashing action
            character (after his appearance in Michael Curtiz' earlier film <i>Captain
            Blood (1935)</i>, also from another Sabatini novel written in 1922).
            The action-film opened in  Spain in the year 1585 as the imperialistic,
            gray-bearded Spanish King Phillip II (Montagu Love) announced his
            intentions to rule the world (and England). He was impatient
              that his Armada was not ready to invade England and stop its plundering
              of Spanish wealth. The King sent his crafty Spanish Ambassador
            Don Jos&eacute; Alvarez de Cordoba (Claude Rains) (accompanied by
            his beautiful niece Do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a (Brenda Marshall)) to
            England to speak to the Queen. During their voyage, the dashing,
            but gentlemanly swashbuckling privateer, British sea Captain Geoffrey
            Thorpe (Errol Flynn),  &quot;the Sea Hawk&quot; (more accurately,
            a &quot;Sea Dog&quot;) on his ship <i>the Albatross</i> attack
            the Spanish ship en route to England. After sinking the Spanish vessel,
            Thorpe escorted the diplomat and his argumentative niece to England
            to meet with the Queen. Meanwhile in England,  Queen Elizabeth I
             (Flora Robson) was being advised to prepare for England's defense
            by building a fleet of ships to repel the Spanish threat (and their
            Armada). One of the Queen's advisors-ministers was roguish Councilor
            Lord Wolfingham (Henry Daniell), a suspicious &quot;fifth columnist&quot; 
			who was secretly collaborating with the Spanish. The Queen secretly
            commissioned and sanctioned the activities of buccaneer pirates
            - such as Thorpe, to contribute plunder to the English Treasury's
          coffers. She gave him her blessing to Thorpe to proceed with his plan
			to  attack Spain's New World treasured &quot;gold
          fleet&quot; (with a year's plunder in gold) that would be leaving Panama
          bound for Spain within three months.  His plan was to head for the
          Isthmus of Panama and land, to engage in a secret jungle raid upon
          Spain's treasure hunters along a Central American mule train gold route.
          Before Thorpe departed, he met with Dona Maria in the Queen's
          palace gardens  where they obviously were falling in love with each
          other. In the swampy Panamanian  jungle, Thorpe and his men were
          ambushed, eventually captured and taken prisoner back to Spain to face
          the Inquisition. The group was sentenced for life as galley slaves
          aboard a Spanish galleon slave ship. During his time as a slave, the
          news of the plot of the Spanish to imminently attack with their newly-built
          Armada and aggressively invade England was passed to Thorpe. He discovered
          that secret documents about the Armada from King Phillip were being
          transferred and taken to London, to be delivered to Spain's traitorous
          spy Lord Wolfingham. This inspired Thorpe and his men to commit mutiny,
          seize the secret dispatches from Phillip to Wolfingham as evidence
          that Spain's war plan was real, and inform the Queen. The film concluded
          with Thorpe's successful return to England, his defeat and murder of
          Wolfingham during a climactic sword-duel, and his delivery of the dispatches
              to the Queen that divulged the entire Spanish plot of treachery
          against England with the Armada. As the film ended, England
          was saved, Thorpe was reunited with his love Dona Maria, and rewarded
          by being recognized by the Queen as a Knight of the Realm on board
          the <i>Albatross. </i>The Queen vowed to her subjects and nation that
          she would rebuild England's fleet to defend the nation. </font></p></td>

              D: Ernst Lubitsch<br />
            Director Ernst Lubitsch's brilliant and charming romantic comedy
            was about everyday people in a &quot;shop around the corner,&quot; with all
            the right elements (the common plot of deception and mistaken identities
            in a love-hate relationship) - to create the right &quot;Lubitsch
            touch.&quot;  It was remade as a musical, <i>In the Good Old Summertime
            (1949) </i>with Judy Garland and Van Johnson, and as the 1963 Broadway play <i>She
            Loves Me</i> that was also a BBC-TV movie in 1979. Later, it became
             the updated <i>You've Got Mail (1998)</i> with
            Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. In the story, the head  sales clerk of a
              Budapest notions/gift shop, Matuschek and Company (owned by autocrat
            Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) and Pirovitch (Felix Bressart)), was
            bookish bachelor  Alfred Kralik (James Stewart). Alfred worked along
            side newly-hired shopgirl Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan). The two
            clerks mutually disliked each other and bickered constantly. The
            two hostile sales-persons were unaware that they had become each
            other's anonymous pen pals writing each other very literate correspondence.
            On paper, they were romantically compatible, and corresponded with
            affectionate &quot;lonely-hearts&quot; letters. On the
            same night that the two pen pals agreed to meet at a cafe, Alfred
            was fired by his employer Matuschek when wrongly suspected of having
            an affair with his wife. [Note: The real culprit was later determined
            to be Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut).] Alfred sought solace with his
            pen-pal sweetheart, in a memorable sequence, but didn't reveal his
            identity as her pen-pal, stringing her along. Soon after, Alfred
            was rehired, given a raise, and promoted to manager - infuriating
            Klara. She was upset that her pen pal hadn't kept his appointment,
            and that she must now work under Alfred. In the inevitable happy
            conclusion set on Christmas Eve, Alfred finally revealed his identity
            to Klara when the two were left alone in the shop after a busy and
            profitable day. He mentioned &quot;Box 237,&quot; tipping her off
            to the fact that he was her &quot;dear friend&quot; and correspondent. </font></p>          </td>

              D: Ludwig Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan, produced by Alexander
              Korda<br />
            Subtitled: An Arabian Fantasy, this fanciful film was a remake of
            the earlier magical silent film <a href="thiefofbagdad.html"><i>The
            Thief of Bagdad (1924)</i></a> starring Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., and
            was later remade as <i>The
            Thief of Bagdad (1961, It.)</i> with Steve Reeves. Disney's animated <i>Aladdin
            (1992) </i> heavily borrowed from this version as well. It became
             one of the best, most enchanting fantasies ever made - with an Arabian
            Nights theme, including spectacular special effects (a mechanical
            horse, a huge spider, an All-Seeing Eye (ruby jewel), the 6-armed
            Silver Maid statue, etc.), amazing Technicolor photography, a memorable
            musical score, and wonderful performances. The film's story began,
            in flashback, as told by an elderly and deposed blind King Ahmad
            (John Justin) of the city of Bagdad, now a beggar. He explained how
            he was tricked out of his kingdom 
             by an oppressive, black-clad, evil magician-sorcerer named
            Jaffar (Conrad Veidt), his treacherous Grand Vizier. A mischievous
             young urchin named Abu (15 year-old Sabu), who was thrown in a dungeon
             for theft, helped the good-hearted, Prince Ahmad escape. In the
             city of Basra, he fell in love (at first sight) with the toy-obsessed
             Sultan's (Miles Malleson) pretty daughter, the Princess (June Duprez).
            Unfortunately, the two were captured - Ahmad was blinded, while Abu
            was magically turned into Ahmad's seeing-eye dog by a black magician.
            The two were promised they would be restored if they rescued the
            Princess. In the end, they saved Ahmad's kingdom and throne and his
            love. Abu and Ahmad were helped by a giant yet jovial genie Djinni
            (Rex Ingram) who emerged in black smoke from a bottle, and possessed
            a magical flying carpet.</font></p>          </td>

              LeRoy<br />
            Director Mervyn LeRoy's classic, sentimental, romantic tearjerker
            was Vivien Leigh's first film following her success in <i><a href="gone.html">Gone
            With The Wind (1939)</a></i>. In the plot, middle-aged
            British colonel Roy Cronin (Robert Taylor) paced on the famous Waterloo
            Bridge in the city of London during World War II - he was again readied
            to be deployed to the war front in France. As he stood on the bridge
            and pulled out of his coat a keepsake (good-luck charm) and symbol
            of a long-lost love of his life, he reminisced about the same setting
            years earlier in 1914 when he was a handsome young Army captain.
            In flashback, he remembered when he was about to depart
              for the trenches.  He recalled during an air raid how he had
              retrieved the dropped purse and lucky charm of 19 year-old Myra
              Lester (Vivien Leigh), a naive and virginal ballet dancer, and
              helped her to an underground station shelter. As they parted after
              an all-clear was announced, she gave him her good-luck charm. The
              two met for dinner and waltzed  in candlelight in the Candlelight
              Club to the tune of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; as
              groups of musicians extinguished their lights - and they experienced
              their first kiss. He was called off to war, but his departure was
              delayed by two days and he and Myra met again the next late morning,
              when he impetuously insisted on marrying Myra. But then when Roy's
              orders were again changed, their plans
              to wed had to be postponed. Bidding him farewell
              at the Waterloo train station, she abandoned her dance performance
              and was subsequently fired from her ballet school troupe by Madame
            Olga Kirowa (Maria Ouspenskaya), the tyrannical mistress. Desperate,
            Myra soon descended into poverty with her best friend/roommate
            Kitty (Virginia Field), and became destitute. Kitty secretly turned
            to prostitution, walking the Waterloo Bridge
            for clients. Soon after, Myra  falsely learned
            that Roy had been killed in the war. Heartbroken and poverty-stricken,
             Myra decided to join Kitty and also became a street-walker and was
            soon picking up male clients on the Waterloo Bridge. In a memorable
            scene, Myra accidentally met Roy when he returned about a year later
            at the London train station, while she was soliciting business from
            returning soldiers. He had only been injured with a head wound and
            became a German prison-camp POW. During their
            reunion, Myra didn't reveal her occupation to him, and pretended
            that she was there to greet a friend. She was overwhelmed by his
            warm welcome, and they renewed their romance
            and lives. Myra soon realized that her deceptive ploys
            would not work, and would only bring shame to Roy's family and his
               rich, socially-conscious, aristocratic mother Lady Margaret
              Cronin (Lucile Watson). She became distraught and suicidal, feeling
              degraded by her indiscretions and deception, and fearing that her
              secrets would resurface and prevent them from marrying. Myra left
              a farewell note for Roy. Afterwards in London, Myra's friend Kitty
              revealed the reality of Myra's nightlife to a disbelieving Roy
              by taking him through one seedy bar after another. In the film's
              most tragic and downbeat scene on a foggy night, the impoverished
              and depressed Myra eluded Roy and deliberately walked into oncoming
              traffic on Waterloo Bridge, where she was struck and killed by
              a truck; the good-luck charm fell from her hand onto the pavement.
              The film returned to the beginning, as General Roy Cronin was on
              the bridge and clutching Myra's good-luck charm before leaving
              for the front. In his memory years later, he tearfully recalled
            her earlier words in the film's final melodramatic moments. </font></p>          </td>

              Wyler<br />
            Director William Wyler's entertaining western saga starred Walter
            Brennan (who won a record-setting third Academy Award for his supporting
            role) and Gary Cooper. The story was told in the era of vicious range
            wars between cattlemen and homesteaders in the post-Civil War period,
            and included an impressive Gregg Toland-filmed prairie fire sequence.
            In the main plot set in 1882, drifter cowboy and saddle tramp Cole
            Harden (Gary Cooper), on his way through Texas to California, rode
            into Vinegaroon, TX (later renamed Langtry) run by notorious, self-appointed,
            despotic hanging Judge Roy Bean (Walter Brennan), who called himself &quot;the
            Law west of the Pecos.&quot; Hardin was falsely accused of stealing a
            horse (claimed to be owned by the Judge's sidekick Chickenfoot
              (Paul Hurst)) after buying a horse from a horse thief (Tom Tyler)
            and was taken before the infamous justice of the peace for a mock
            trial, and sentenced to hang. He talked his way out of being hanged
            by convincing the judge of his friendship with the obsessive judge's
            idol, English stage star Lily Langtry (Lilian Bond). Later, he gave
            the judge a lock of her hair, convincing him it was real, although
            he had cut the lock from the head of homesteader Jane-Ellen Mathews
            (Doris Davenport). The real horse thief was ultimately
            identified and killed. Harden ended up defending homesteaders on
            the opposite side from the judge in a bloody and violent range war
            and land dispute. In the final showdown and shootout scene, Harden
            confronted the judge in a gas-lit opera theatre in Ft. Davis, TX
            with guns drawn before a Langtry performance. When the theater curtain
            opened, it revealed  the deputized
            Harden standing on stage and ready for a gunfight with Judge Bean
            (the sole audience member) rather than a performance by British actress
            Lily Langtry (Lilian Bond) - 'the famous Jersey Lily.' The Judge
            was lethally wounded during a brief gunfight. Backstage,
            the dying Judge was wide-eyed as he glimpsed the fantasy woman of
            his life; she  blurred in his vision as he fell dead.</font></p></td>
