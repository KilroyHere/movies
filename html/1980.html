              minutes, D: Jim Abrahams, Jerry Zucker, David Zucker<br />
            This absurdist, trend-setting, zany and hilarious comedy came from
            the writing/directing team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry
            Zucker (known colloquially as ZAZ and their brand of &quot;ZAZ
          humor&quot;). It was preceded by the team's screenwriting
          for John Landis' <em>The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977)</em> (the ZAZ
          trio of comedy writers were known as <em>The Kentucky Fried Theater</em> when
          they performed as a Wisconsin comedy troupe), and later they wrote <em>Top
          Secret! (1984)</em>, and <em>Ruthless People (1986)</em>. <i>Airplane!</i> cleverly
          used the airplane disaster film, such as <em>Airport
          (1970),</em> and the earlier serious film <i>Zero Hour! (1957)</i> as
          a parody- or spoof-stepping stone. This movie also revitalized the
          acting careers of Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges, and Robert Stack, and
          launched the comedy career of Leslie Nielsen as the straight-faced,
          dead-panning Dr. Rumack, who up to that time was known mostly for B-movie
          dramatic roles, in films like <em><a href="forbiddenplanet.html">Forbidden
          Planet (1956)</a> </em>and<em> The Poseidon Adventure (1972)</em>. The
          plot was an excuse for a frantic, slapstick gutbuster filled with visual-sight
            gags, puns, verbal literalism: (&quot;Surely you can't be serious.&quot; &quot;I
            am serious, and don't call me Shirley&quot;), rapid-fire satirical
            wisecracks, irreverent references to <em><a href="from.html">From
              Here to Eternity (1953)</a></em> and <em><a href="satnightfever.html">Saturday Night Fever (1977)</a></em> disco
          dancing,  visual non-sequiturs, and much more.  It
          was followed by a less funny ZAZ-less <em>Airplane II: The Sequel (1982)</em> by
          director Ken Finkleman. In the storyline, shell-shocked,
          alcoholic ex-military flyer Ted Striker (Robert Hays) pursued ex-girlfriend
          Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty) - a stewardess on an ill-fated Trans-American
          flight from LA to Chicago with stricken pilots due to food poisoning,
          including  Captain Clarence Oveur (Peter Graves) and Co-Pilot Roger
          Murdock (BB player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). Striker was required to fly
          the plane, filled with an assortment of odd stereotypical characters,
          such as two black Jive Dudes (with subtitled dialogue), a guitar-strumming
          Nun (Maureen McGovern), a young female heart transplant patient on
          a stretcher with IV drip, and many more. To aid Striker, Elaine was
          instructed by Chicago's air traffic control tower supervisor Steve
          McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the plane's plastic blow-up doll
          autopilot &quot;Otto&quot; - and later when Otto deflated, she had to manually
          inflate him. Striker's ex-commander Rex Kramer (Robert Stack) was able
          to ultimately talk the plane down for a rough but safe landing, and
          due to Striker's courage, Elaine rekindled her relationship with him. </font></p>          </td>

          Director John Landis' rock-filled, anarchic, musical, action-adventure
              crime-comedy, with a plot derived from stars Dan Aykroyd's
              and John Belushi's popular SNL (NBC-TVs <i>Saturday Night Live</i>)
              sketch known as the &quot;Blues Brothers,&quot; featured many cameo appearances
              and performers. The title characters were  &quot;Blues
              Brothers&quot; - two white singers with soul who wore shades, and
              identical black suits and hats. In the opening scene, Joliet (Illinois)
              Prison inmate &quot;Joliet&quot; Jake Blues (John Belushi), a blues
              singer, was paroled after three years. Outside the prison gate,
              he met up with his brother Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd), driving
              a used, battered, super-powered Plymouth police car - dubbed their
              Bluesmobile. The brothers traveled to their childhood home
            in Calumet City, IL, where they visited the Roman Catholic orphanage
                (St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud) where they were raised. They
              met with their former teacher and head orphanage nun Sister Mary &quot;The
              Penguin&quot; Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), who sent them on a &quot;mission
              from God&quot; to raise $5,000 (for property taxes) to save her
              orphanage from foreclosure.  The brothers attended the
                Triple Rock Baptist Church, in the presence of Reverend Cleophus
                James (James Brown), who was preaching a sermon titled &quot;The
                Old Landmark&quot;: &quot;Do you see the light?...Have you seen
                the light?&quot;  The two  had an epiphany (conversion
                experience), and dedicated themselves to raising the $5,000 for
                the orphanage after reassembling their R&amp;B Blues Brothers
                Band. Elwood repeatedly spoke his famous line to Jake: (&quot;We're
                on a mission from God!&quot;) to justify their brotherly activities.
                To  avoid arrest by two Illinois
                State Police Troopers, they fled in their Bluesmobile,
                followed by a contingent of police cars. The comedy has become
                well known for its tremendous number of noisy and wasteful multi-car
                crashes and pile-ups on their way to and in the city of Chicago
                as they were relentlessly pursued in their Bluesmobile by police.
                 There was an incredible amount of carnage, destroyed buildings
                and an entire shopping mall (Dixie Square Mall). In a run-down
                area of Chicago, they narrowly avoided being hurt by two bazooka
                rocket launches by a strange Mystery Woman (Carrie Fisher). To
                assemble former band members, they located them and recruited
                them. They also were confronted, while driving around in
                their Bluesmobile, by a traffic jam at Jackson Park  caused
                by Head Neo-Nazi Leader (Henry Gibson) conducting a rally of &quot;Illinois
                Nazis&quot; on a stone bridge. The Blues Brothers
                forced the hateful Nazi followers to jump off the bridge into
                a lagoon when they drove through. While being pursued by troopers,
                there were numerous Blues Brothers' musical performances including
                in a soul food diner,
                at Ray's Music Exchange Shop in Calumet City, at
                      Bob's Country Bunker in Kokomo, Indiana to a rowdy country-music
                crowd, and at the Palace Hotel
                      Ballroom over 100 miles north of Chicago. As the film was
                approaching its end,  the Mystery Woman  was revealed as Jake's
                ex-fiancee whom he had abandoned at her wedding several years
                ago; Jake apologized and they reconciled. A massive car chase
                commenced as the Bluesmobile headed 106 miles southward toward
                Chicago, pursued by police officers and state troopers, the enraged
                Good Ole Boys, the Nazis, Illinois National Guardsmen, SWAT teams,
          MPs, helicopters, and other disgruntled characters. In 
          the final scene, their dilapidated car sputtered to a stop at Daley
          Plaza. Inside  the adjacent Cook County City
          Hall Assessor's office, the Blues Brothers were able to pay the orphanage's
          property taxes to one of the office clerks (Steven Spielberg in a cameo)
          - but were then promptly arrested and handcuffed with dozens of guns
          pointed at them. Following their arrest, the Blues Brothers played
            &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; during a prison concert to entertain
          the other inmates. </font></p>

              D: Bruce Beresford<br />
          This anti-war film's setting was during the era of the brutal Boer
          War (1899-1902) between the Boers (Afrikaaners) and the British Carabineers
          in the area of the Northern Transvaal - it was a struggle for independence.
          During the fighting, the elite Bushveldt Carabineers (Australians)
          were ambushed and Captain Hunt was captured, mutilated and killed.
          In revenge, Lt. Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant (Edward Woodward)
          and his men took and executed prisoners. To end the war with the Boers
          and appease the Germans, British general Lord Kitchener selected three
          scapegoats to be put on trial: Morant, Lt. Peter Handcock (Bryan Brown)
          and Lt. George Witton (Lewis Fitzgerald). Lt. Colonel Denny (Charles
          Tingwell) presided over the 5-person general court-martial tribunal,
          held in a remote courtroom. Major Charles Bolton (Rod Mullinar) prosecuted,
          while inexperienced defense attorney Major F. Thomas (Edward Woodward)
          defended the three hapless soldiers in a sham trial. Thomas valiantly
          struggled to defend the men, arguing that in such an unconventional
          war, there were bound to be casualties, and unclear instructions about
          how to treat the enemy. Handcock and Morant were sentenced
              to death (and shot at sunrise), while Witton was sentenced to life
          (although released after three years). </font></p>        </td>

                D: Irvin Kershner<br />
            This was the second in the famous <em>Star Wars</em> original trilogy
            (Episodes IV-VI) of fantastic science-fiction films, often rated
            as the best in the trilogy, and followed by <em><a href="series-starwars6.html">Episode
            VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)</a>. </em>It featured stunning
          special-effects, great characters and a rich, comic-bookish storyline.
		  Although the Death Star had
              been destroyed three years earlier, it remained a dark time for
              the Rebels, who were struggling against the Emperor's Imperial
              forces, who quickly regrouped and began searching for the new location
              of the Rebel base. Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice of James Earl
              Jones) led the hunt for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), taking orders
              from the commanding ruler of the galaxy, the Emperor. Freedom fighters
              led by Luke, regarding him as the Rebel's only hope, had established
              a new secret base in a hidden ice cave on the remote and icy  
              planet-world of Hoth. However, their location was discovered and
              an evacuation was underway, as a major battle was fought between
              the Hoth planet Rebels and gigantic Imperial Snow-Walkers (AT-AT's)
            - armed walking transports. The Rebellion was defeated. Space jockey
              Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the Wookie &quot;Chewie&quot; Chewbacca
              (Peter Mayhew), robotic droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Princess
              Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) fled in Solo's <i>Millennium Falcon</i> to
              hide in an asteroid field, while Luke journeyed with the second
              droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to the swampy planet of Dagobah, to train
              in the wise ways of the Force and Jedi Knights with wizened, gnome-like,
              greenish Jedi master Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) (who was living in
              hiding in a swamp since the Republic fell), to master the power
              of the Force. Although Han Solo's group thought they had avoided
              detection from the pursuit of Imperial Star Destroyers, they were
              silently being trailed by bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch),
              on their way to a &quot;safe port&quot; - the floating Cloud City
              on the planet of Bespin - owned by Solo's
              old friend and supposed-ally Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).
              Unfortunately, Darth Vader had already arrived and was awaiting
              them. Vader captured Han, Leia and Chewbacca, and also lured young
              Skywalker there to entrap him, by using his friends as bait. Meanwhile,
              Solo was placed into a carbonite-freezing chamber to be encased
              in suspended animation (it was a test so that Vader could be assured
              that the process planned for Luke was not fatal). When Luke arrived,
              he engaged in a fierce, face-to-face light-saber duel with the
              Sith Lord - Darth Vader, who wished to convert Luke to the Dark
              Side. Luke's hand was amputated with one swing - and then he was
              horrified when told that Vader was his father, Anakin Skywalker.
              During their duel, Lando's men surprised the Imperial troops, freed
              Leia and the enraged Chewbacca, and the group of rebels departed
              to save Han. The episode ended with Solo imprisoned by Jabba the
              Hutt and his bounty hunter Boba Fett (with Lando and Chewbacca
              in pursuit), while Luke was rescued and given a bionic hand.</font></p>        </td>

              Redford<br />
              Actor Robert Redford's directorial debut film was an intense psychological
              drama (an adaptation of the Judith Guest 1976 novel by Alvin Sargent)
              about the Jarrett family, a tragically torn-apart family living
              in Lake Forest, IL, an affluent suburb of Chicago. It won four
              Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, and
              Best Adapted Screenplay. The 4-person character drama was often
              accentuated with the brilliant mood-setting use of Johann Pachelbel's
              mournful adagio <i>Canon
              in D Major</i>. In a series of moving scenes and flashbacks, guilt-ridden, troubled
               18 year-old high-school student Conrad &quot;Con&quot; Jarrett
              (Oscar-winning Timothy Hutton) suffered from severe PTSD. After
              a suicide attempt (slitting his wrists) and four months' hospitalization,
              Con admitted his feelings of fault about his older teenaged brother
              Buck's (Scott Doebler) accidental drowning (during a sailing trip
              revealed over the course of the film seen in flashbacks) in his
              late-night counseling sessions with his sometimes unorthodox psychiatrist
              Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch). Eventually, Con  was  able
              to stop blaming himself for Buck's death. In contrast, Con's mother
               was a grieving, hostile, bitter, composed and rejecting mother
               Beth Jarrett (Mary Tyler Moore), while his father Calvin (Donald
               Sutherland), a successful tax attorney, was more  warm-hearted
        and compassionate. Con's mother Beth was unable to sympathize with Con
        due to her prejudiced love for Buck and her continual coldness toward
               Con - and she became the main focal point, emphasized during her
               major defensive outburst at a Houston-area golf course during
               a vacation trip: (&quot;Hate him! God, how could I hate him? Mothers
               don't hate their sons! Is that what he told you? Do you see how
               you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the
               same thing for me, you can't! GOD I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANYONE WANTS
               FROM ME ANYMORE!...&quot;). In the final scene, Calvin directly admitted the loss of his
               love for his wife in the dining room: &quot;You can't handle mess.
               You need everything neat and easy. I don't know. Maybe you can't
               love anybody. It was so much Buck. When Buck died, it was as if
               you buried all your love with him. And I don't understand that.&quot;
               Afterwards, Beth promptly packed up and departed in a taxi, leaving
               Calvin outside and deep in thought into the early morning hours.
               The closing scene was in the Jarrett's backyard before the credits,
               when Calvin told Conrad that a very shaken Beth had left for Houston
               to live for awhile. Predictably, Conrad blamed himself, but was
               angrily dissuaded by his father  to take credit for
            Beth's decision to leave. The two came to a new understanding - hugged
               and embraced, and both pledged their love for each other in
            the film's final two lines. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Martin Scorsese<br />
            Director Martin Scorsese's magnificently visceral, vivid and real,
            black and white sports bio/docu-drama told about the rise and fall
            of a violent, suicidally-macho prize-fighter - the 1949 middleweight
            boxing champ Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro). The film was regularly
            voted the Best Film of the decade of the 80s. In the major character
            study, the film opened with the retired boxer now as an out-of-shape,
            second-rate stand-up nightclub entertainer in NYC in 1964, twenty-three
            years later at the Barbizon Plaza Theatre. The remainder of the film
            was a flashback - a look back at the middle-aged man's life to try
            to understand why he was reciting lines of Shakespeare in his dressing
            room. In the film's many brutal and graphic boxing sequences (often
            in slow-motion with the spray onto the audience and the violent sounds
            of impact), LaMotta was a hard-headed, animalistic fighter. In the
            first sequence set in 1941, Jake was declared the loser (it was a
            Mafia-fixed fight) against his opponent Jimmy Reeves. Jake's brother
            Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) also served as Jake's contentious fight
            manager and  often experienced bouts of domestic violence
            with Joey. Jake had grown up as an unlovable slum kid in a hellish
            neighborhood. Although married to his first wife Irma (Lori Anne
            Flax), he pursued 15 year-old, blonde  &quot;neighborhood girl&quot; 
			Vickie (20 year old Cathy Moriarty), first viewed at a swimming pool.
			In 1943, Jake fought and was victorious over boxer Sugar Ray Robinson,
			giving his opponent his first loss in the ring - and marking a long
			rivalry between the two. Once he became more successful after more
			fights in the mid-1940s, LaMotta married Vickie and bought a suburban
			home for them in the Bronx, but then by 1947, he slowly but predictably
			descended into fat slobbishness and was unfit to fight unless he
			trained vigorously and lost at least 15 pounds. Although he was able
			to continue boxing and won the middleweight title in the late 1940s,
			he was always violently and insanely jealous of Vickie and anyone
			who showed her attention or affection - he also accused Joey of being
			adulterous with her and &quot;violating&quot; her,
			and viciously assaulted both Vickie and Joey. The brothers became
			estranged, and Vickie threatened to leave him, but relented. In 1951
			in his 5th and final middleweight championship boxing ring battle
			against Sugar Ray Robinson, Jake defended his title and lost the
			bloody bout. Five years later in 1956, Jake had retreated to Miami,
			Florida and retired from boxing, and was living there with Vickie
			and the children. He was transformed from a sleek professional boxer
			to an out-of-shape, stand-up entertainer at his own seedy nightclub,
			offering up crude jokes and flirtatious behavior. By this time, Vickie
			had decided to leave Jake for good and filed for divorce and custody
			of the children. In 1957, Jake was arrested on a morals charge for
			soliciting a client for a young 14 year-old female in his nightclub,
			and jailed (without bail money) and placed in solitary confinement
			in a Dade County stocade, where he banged his head into the wall
			and wailed: (&quot;Why?
			Why? Why?...Why'd you do it? Why? You're so stupid&quot;). In  1958, Jake
			took a job introducing strippers in a seedy NY bar. After a chance
			encounter with Joey on a NY street, he made a failed attempt  at reconciling with his brother, but was ignored. The
			film ended with Jake portrayed again as an overweight and bloated
			night-club emcee at the Barbizon Plaza Theatre (a return to the film's
			beginning in 1964), where in his backstage dressing-room, he recited Brando's
			famous <i>On
			the Waterfront</i> &quot;I
          coulda been a contender&quot; speech
          in the taxi-cab scene, and shadow-boxed with his mirror image while
          mumbling:
           &quot;I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss...&quot;, before appearing
           on-stage. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Stanley Kubrick<br />
            Creative director Stanley Kubrick's intense,  gothic, haunted
            house horror film masterpiece was based upon sci-fi/horror author
            Stephen King's 1977 best-selling novel (his third novel under his
            own name) of the same name. However, the film's source material 
            bore little resemblance to Kubrick's creation. With
            American co-screenwriter Diane Johnson, Kubrick moved from the conventions
            of traditional horror film thrillers, displacing them with his own,
            much more subtle, rich, symbolic motifs. As
            in many of his films, director Kubrick explored the dimensions of
            the genre to create the ultimate horror film of a man going mad. The
            film had beautiful, stylish work that distanced itself from the blood-letting
            and gore of most modern films in the horror genre. Kubrick
            deliberately reduced the pace of the narrative and expanded the rather
            simple plot of a domestic tragedy to over two hours in length, created
            lush images within the ornate interior of the main set, added a disturbing
            synthesized soundtrack (selecting musical works from Bela Bartok,
            Gyorgy Ligeti, and Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki), used a
            Steadicam in groundbreaking fashion, filmed most of the gothic horror
            in broad daylight or brightly-lit scenes, and built an unforgettable,
            mounting sensation of frustration, rage, terror, ghosts, and the
            paranormal. The epic film followed the disintegrating Torrance family -- ex-teacher
            and aspiring writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson in an over-the-top
            performance), his high-strung wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and young
            son Danny (Danny Lloyd). Jack was interviewed by hotel manager Ullman
            (Barry Nelson) to fill a position with his family as the 
            off-season caretakers of an isolated, snowbound
            resort - the imposing, remote Rocky Mountain hotel, the Overlook.
              During the family's visit to the hotel, they learned about some
              of the hotel's disturbing history, and were warned about the long-term
              effects of winter isolation. Once Jack acquired the position and
              the family moved in, Danny became affected by a &quot;psychic photograph&quot; of a 
            bloody series of historic murders committed at
            the hotel. The film's title &quot;the shining&quot; 
            referred to the extra-sensory, paranormal psychic abilities possessed
            by the Overlook's head cook Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) and Danny.
            Hallorann specifically warned Danny about Room 237 (where later, Jack
            came upon a beautiful naked woman who turned into a ghastly old hag). With
            sleep deprivation and growing dementia, Jack eventually became truly
            insane and possessed by the hotel's haunted, misogynistic and murderous
            history. He fraternized at the bar with the hotel's ghosts and spectral
            bartender (Joe Turkel), and hours on end typed insanely: &quot;All work
            and no play make Jack a dull boy&quot; - in hundreds of different configurations.
            Danny was also overtaken by visionary images of the horrific past in
            the hotel - envisioning two young murdered daughters of the previous
            caretaker, and experiencing a premonition of waves of blood emerging
            from an elevator into the hallway. With a smiling, demonically-insane,
            shining face (and trademarked sneer and arching eyebrows), Jack began
            to homicidally stalk his own family members with an axe (&quot;Heeeere's
            Johnny!&quot;) throughout the hotel, now transformed into a cartoonish, 
			rampaging aggressor. When Hallorann
            was summoned back to the hotel from Florida, he was a victim of
            Jack's crazed homicidal urges. Unable to destroy his future posterity,
            Jack froze to death in a convoluted garden maze built on the grounds
            while chasing after Danny. The film's last image was of Jack in
          a photograph of a large group people at the hotel in 1921. </font></p>          </td>
