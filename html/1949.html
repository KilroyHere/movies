            <font size="2">This </font><font size="2"> film noir was based upon
            June Truesdell's 1947 novel, &quot;Be
                Still, My Love.&quot; The dramatic psychological crime thriller
                opened with psychology professor Dr. Wilma Tuttle (Loretta Young),
                a prim and proper teacher at a small Southern California LA college,
                at a Pacific Coast Highway beach in Malibu one evening. After
                hitching a ride home with a trucker Jack Hunter (Mickey Knox),
                Wilma slept restlessly and in the morning, she recalled - in
                flashback - entirely what had occurred the previous day. She
                had been fending off the flirtatious romantic advances of one
                of her students, handsome Bill Perry (Douglas Dick), a &quot;bad
                boy&quot; who came from
                a dysfunctional family. As they parked next to an isolated beach
                cliff, he changed into a bathing suit and then became sexually
                aroused (he called her a &quot;little firecracker&quot;) - and
                attempted to rape her. She resisted, picked up a tire iron, and
                unintentionally beat him to death. To cover up the crime, she
                tossed his body over the cliff into the ocean, making it appear
                that Bill was diving into the water from cliff's edge. The overwhelmingly-distraught
                Wilma was anxious and guilt-ridden about the murder. She learned
                from Bill's guardian, lawyer Warren Ford (Robert Cummings), that
                Susan Duval (Suzanne Dalbert), a foreign exchange student in
                the same class who had unrequited love for Bill, claimed (falsely)
                that he had impregnated her, in order to get his attention. When
                Bill's body was found, skilled investigating detective Lt. Ted
                Dorgan (Wendell Corey) concluded that it was murder, and Susan
                became the prime suspect. To allay suspicion, Wilma began to
                date Warren (and soon, they became engaged), and she was fortunate
                that the trucker couldn't identify her. Forensics lab technician
                Dr. Romley (Sam Jaffe) concluded accurately that the killer had
                struck Bill on the head with a lethal blow, and then faked Bill's
                drowning. Wilma was having frequent anxiety attacks and outbursts.
                Detective Dorgan suspected that Wilma was the murderer - he knew
                she had copied a letter to Bill (that she had put on her door,
                but the janitor had thrown away) about cancelling a date to see
                him, in order to help establish her innocence. He also knew that
                Bill's last words were that he was going to meet with a &quot;cyclothymiac
                cutie&quot; - a phrase about a chronic mood disorder taken from
                one of Wilma's exam questions on personality. Wilma knew that
                Bill had described her as a repressed, prudish female in the
                exam, and she feared that she would be connected to Bill's death. </font><font size="2">With
                a subpoena to appear in court, Wilma confessed to the killing
                after re-enacting the murder scene. She was arrested, and Warren
                elected to defend her - arguing that the crime was committed
                in self-defense. In his closing argument, he convincingly argued
                that fearful Wilma's only crime was the cover-up. Detective Dorgan
                realized that the circumstances of the case, defended by the
                love-struck lawyer, would fully exonerate her.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: George Cukor<br />
            Director George Cukor's great, sophisticated, battle-of-the-sexes
            comedy was one of Hollywood's greatest  classics. The comedy
            was often rated as the best pairing of the nine films of the legendary
            screen team of Tracy and Hepburn - it was their sixth film together.
            The film also skyrocketed the career of Judy Holliday who went on
            to play the lead role in <i>Born Yesterday (1950)</i>. It
            told about husband-and-wife lawyers in the upper middle-class who
            were forced to compete against each other when they took opposite
            sides of a front-page court case. It featured a forward-looking,
             provocative screenplay with snappy dialogue
            by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin - the husband and wife's second collaboration
            with director George Cukor. The sophisticated
            film was originally titled <em>Man and Wife</em>, and was later remade
            into a 1973 TV series spin-off with Ken Howard and Blythe Danner.
            The opening scene was an attempted assault/murder of a philandering,
            two-timing husband Warren Attinger (Tom Ewell) by his scatterbrained,
            'dumb blonde' wife Doris Attinger (Judy Holliday in her debut major
            film role) after reading an instruction manual about how to use a
            gun. The wronged Brooklyn housewife, a real bombshell, vengefully
            shot and wounded her husband Warren who was with his mistress Beryl
            Caighn (Jean Hagen) in a Manhattan apartment. Husband/wife
            Amanda and Adam Bonner (Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy) were
            introduced as they revealed their different viewpoints about the
            sexes during an early driving scene in the city: (Amanda: &quot;There
            are lots of things that a man can do and in society's eyes, it's
            all hunky-dory. A woman does the same thing - the same, mind you,
            and she's an outcast...All I'm saying is, why let this deplorable
            system seep into our courts of law, where women are supposed to be
            equal?&quot;). A  chauvinistic, law and order Asst. District Attorney,
            Adam was called upon to prosecute Doris Attinger for attempted murder
            - seen in the film's opening. Adam first learned of his savvy wife's
            role as defense attorney against him when she declared: &quot;I'm
          going to defend her&quot; - (he toppled and spilled a tray of drinks).
          She had volunteered to defend Doris (pro bono) with feminist, women's
          rights arguments. Amanda claimed that Doris had the same right (an &quot;unwritten
          law&quot;)
          as a man to shoot a spouse when caught in adultery - the principle
          of equal justice. Her position angered Adam
            who felt his wife was upsetting sexist double standards. There were
            personal tensions on the homefront each evening between Amanda and
            Adam when the trial conflict moved into their home. The Bonners engaged
            in a confrontation on a massage table at home when he slapped her
              behind hard: (&quot;What are you - sore about a little slap?&quot; and
              her reply: &quot;I know a slap from a slug&quot;); and eventually
              Adam moved out. During the trial, Beryl testified that Warren was
              at the apartment to sell her an insurance policy, and that he never
              touched her. Doris testified that she found the two hugging together
              on the couch, and that she wanted to save their marriage and family
              (they had three children) - all she wanted to do was frighten Warren
          (and she did wound him in the shoulder), not injure him or Beryl. To
          bolster her case (although irrelevant), Amanda called three successful
          female witnesses to demonstrate equality of the sexes - her own political
          agenda. Adam's closing argument was weak, due to
          the fact that Amanda interrupted him with frequent objections to his
          claims that Doris was a criminal, and she also used persuasive theatrical
          tricks (a role-play scenario with reversed positions for Doris and
          Warren). She proved that the law would vindicate a man who would try
          to kill the lover of his unfaithful wife. Ultimately,
          the jury acquitted the simple-minded Doris, and Adam was forced to
          reluctantly admit that Amanda had presented an effective and contrasting
          point of view. At film's end, Adam finally and conclusively stated
          that there was very little difference between men and women - but then
            exclaimed that he did like that &quot;little
            difference&quot;: &quot;<i>Vive la difference.</i>&quot;</font></p>

              109 minutes, D: Robert Rossen<br />
          The Best Picture-winning, hard-hitting film, a great political drama,
          was the melodramatic, film-noirish story of the corruption of power
          by an ambitious demagogue (with B-picture star Broderick Crawford in
          an impressive, electrifying, Oscar-winning  breakthrough role) -
          it was adapted and based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning and best-selling
          1946 novel of the same name by Robert Penn Warren, and filmed from
          a script by producer-screenwriter-director Robert Rossen (known for
          directing other films such as <em>Body and
          Soul (1947)</em> and <em><a href="hust.html">The
          Hustler (1961)</a></em>). Rossen's fictionalized account told of
          the rise and fall of backwoods, honest and naive rebel lawyer and poor
          rural farmer turned into a corrupt, dirty, unscrupulous, backstabbing,
          and sleazy politician - a story inspired by the rule (and despotic
          abuse of power) of Louisiana's colorful state governor (1928-32) and
          Democratic U.S. Senator (1932-35), the notorious Huey Long - better
          known as &quot;The Kingfish&quot; - who was only removed from office
          when he was assassinated. One of the film's posters proclaimed: &quot;He
              thought he had the world by the tail...till it exploded in his
            face...with a bullet attached...&quot; In the film's 
			opening, young <i>Chronicle</i> newspaperman
            Jack Burden (Oscar-nominated John Ireland) was sent to report on
            a Southern politician named Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford) - an
            underdog running for County Treasurer of Kanoma County (in an unnamed
            state) in the late 1920s. Jack was taken to Stark's rural home to
            meet Willie's long-suffering ex-schoolteacher-wife (of nine years)
            Lucy (Anne Seymour), his father Pa Stark (H. C. Miller), and their
            sullen 15 year-old adopted step-son Tom (John Derek). Although Burden
            was impressed by Stark's honesty and thought favorably of him, others
            had conflicting points of view. At this time on an island community
            known as Burden's Landing, Burden proposed marriage to Anne Stanton
            (Joanne Dru), the socialite niece of patriarchal Judge Montgomery
            (Monty) Stanton (Raymond Greenleaf), but she turned him down. [Note:
            Anne Stanton was the sister of idealistic Dr. Adam Stanton (Sheppard
            Strudwick).] Willie lost the election to local politicos, but went
            on to acquire a self-taught law degree to become a hick lawyer. Then,
            he was encouraged to run for state governor by state bosses in the
            capital, but was really being manipulated by them to split the rural &quot;hick&quot; vote
            to allow their candidate to win. Stark's cool, conniving and calculating
            political aide  Sadie Burke (Oscar-winning Mercedes McCambridge)
            knew that Stark was being framed and used as a decoy. Nonetheless,
            before losing, Stark delivered a rousing, memorable impromptu speech
            at the fairgrounds that truly spoke to the people (&quot;Listen to
            me, you hicks!&quot;). Four years later, Willie conducted a second
            campaign for Governor, and Burden was hired as his chief aide, hatchet
            man and speech writer. The shrewd Sadie Burke became his secretary
            and campaign manager - and his mistress on the side - and Willie
            made lots of behind-the-scenes deals to finance his winning campaign.
            Burden slowly became disillusioned and troubled as he observed Stark's
            corruptible rise to power as a demagogue (&quot;strange
            deals&quot; with
            special interests), his philandering, and his shady character. As
            part of his winning strategy, Willie appointed Judge Stanton to the
            office of Attorney General after taking power, but Stanton ultimately
            resigned after learning of Willie's coverup of many corrupt scandals
            and graft in his administration. However, during his reign, Willie
             improved the schools and roads, built power dams and retained
            the love of the people. As a charismatic governor, rising to the
            pinnacle of power, he established his own political machine and became
            as brutal, fascistic, fearsome, dirty, despotic, dishonest and corrupt
            as the crooks he had replaced. Willie was also cheating on his mistress
            Sadie, even taking his friend Jack's fiancee, an infatuated Anne,
            as his other mistress. Burden was assigned by Stark to dig up dirt
            on Stanton's background (he discovered that Judge Stanton was involved
            in wrongdoings many years earlier - a petty, but unsavory blackmail
            scandal to acquire a job) - and Anne betrayed her uncle by revealing
            Burden's uncovered information to Stark. Meanwhile, Stark was planning
            to eventually move on to the White House after another gubernatorial
            campaign, although he first had to endure an impeachment trial being
            conducted against him by the state legislature. Willie schemed to
            use the information discovered by Burden to confront reputable Judge
            Stanton who controlled the decisive impeachment votes of Senators
            who backed him. As a result, the disgraced Stanton committed suicide
            - off-screen. The film concluded with Stark's assassination by Anne's
            disgruntled and outraged brother Dr. Adam Stanton, who was upset
            over Anne's romantic involvement with Willie, and her betrayal of
            the Judge (by divulging to Stark &quot;dirt&quot; on the Judge's past dug up
            by Burden). He  also indirectly blamed Stark for the suicidal death
            of his uncle. As the film concluded,  Stark was acquitted
            in the impeachment hearings, and he emerged to deliver a victory
            speech to the hick crowd on the steps of the state capital building.
            There, he was  gunned down by Adam, followed by Adam's death by
            Stark's accompanying bodyguard-henchman Sugar Boy (Walter Burke).
            After Anne and Burden both knelt over Adam's body,  Burden
             tried to convince Anne to remain with him in the capital to reveal
            the truth about Willie to the crowd. Mortally wounded and dying on
            the steps, a dismayed Stark delivered his final
            words: &quot;It
            could have been whole world - Willie Stark. The whole world - Willie
            Stark. Why does he do it to me - Willie Stark? Why?&quot; </font></p>          </td>

        A. Wellman<br />
        Director William Wellman's solid, ultra-realistic, grim and authentic-looking
        war drama featured a star-studded cast. It was nominated for six Oscars
        (including Best Picture), with wins for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay
        (by Robert Pirosh, a veteran of the Battle of Bastogne), and Best B/W
        Cinematography. It was a milestone film - as the first significant post-WWII
        film in the US. It was dedicated to &quot;the Battered Bastards of Bastogne&quot;
        - referring to a WWII platoon of American troops  in
        the elite 101st Airborne Division (&quot;The Screaming Eagles&quot;).
        The members of E Company became trapped at the strategic crossroads of 
		the city of Bastogne in December, 1944
        during wintry conditions - surrounded and outnumbered
          and awaiting their fate. The raw recruits were dug in behind the German
        lines during  their last-ditch advance at the Battle of the Bulge
        (the Siege of Bastogne) in the Ardennes forest. The plotless story was
        told as a character study of the various stressed-out GI comrades and
        dogfaces from around the country (a representative and ordinary group
        of soldiers) - including their fears, hopes, light-hearted humor and
        courage. When caught in inclement weather (the &quot;fog
        of war&quot;), the infantry group was cut off from supplies (reinforcements
        of food, gas, medicine and ammunition) and military intelligence. They
        were forced to create foxholes in the snow, avoid German bombs (&quot;incoming
        mail&quot;), fight in hand-to-hand combat, and deal with Germans wearing
        American uniforms. At one point, the Germans appeared with a white truce
        flag, but were actually demanding that Brigadier General McAuliffe
        surrender, but he delivered a famous reply: &quot;Nuts!&quot; - of course, misunderstood
        by the Germans. The various characters
              who were serving their country included tough, tobacco-spitting
              lead Sgt. Kinnie (James Whitmore) who suffered from frost-bitten
              feet, wise-cracking paratrooper Pfc. Holley (Van Johnson), a religious
              Latino from LA (who wished to see snow) by the name of Pvt. Johnny
              Roderigues (Ricardo Montalban), Jarvess (John Hodiak) - an enlistee
              and small-town Kansas newspaper columnist, &quot;Pop&quot; Ernest
            J.S. Stazak (George Murphy) - the oldest member of the platoon, and
            innocent and idealistic rookie Pvt. Jim Layton (Marshall Thompson)
            - the film's narrator. An additional character was the Chaplain (Leon
            Ames) who delivered a moralistic sermon about the justified fight
            against Nazi fascism: (&quot;And the $64 question is: 'Was this trip
            necessary?'&quot;).
            There was also a side story involving Mme. Denise (Denise Darcel)
            when the squad was forced to stay in her apartment. Eventually
            when the skies cleared, the platoon survived after Allied fighter
            aircraft were able to attack, C-47s from the Third Army dropped parachutes
            with supplies, and they were relieved by fresh troops. The film concluded
            with their rhythmic cadence march, called out by Sgt. Kinnie as they
            left the battlefield and passed an arriving relief column. </font></p>          </td>

        minutes, D: King Vidor<br />
        King Vidor's muddled, far-fetched and absurd film-noirish melodrama featured
         an impressive score by Max Steiner. It starred the inimitable Bette
        Davis in her last film for Warners after 18 years. The main female protagonist
        was one of the baddest, trashiest, and most warped of all <i>femme fatales </i>in
        cinematic history. The story was told in flashback by a narrator, who
        introduced the character of Rosa Moline (Bette Davis) as &quot;evil&quot;
        - a suspect in a possible manslaughter case. The film reviewed the events
        that led up to Rosa's murder inquest, the context for her &quot;evil&quot; reputation,
        and the events that led up to an accidental murder.  Black-hearted,
        unattractive hag Rosa was a Loyalton, Wisconsin mill town girl, married
        to a decent, saintly small-town Midwestern doctor Dr. Lewis Moline (Joseph
        Cotten). She was dissatisfied, bored, neglected, discontented, and repressed
        by small town life in the mill town, longing for and coveting  big-city
        life and desperate for wealth. She complained: &quot;If I don't get out
        of here, I'll just die! Living here is like waiting for the funeral to
        begin. No, it's like waiting in the coffin for them to take you out!&quot; She
        snarled at her husband about their modest home -  &quot;What
        a dump!&quot; (referenced in <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966)</i>).
        To escape her boredom, she first attempted adultery, engaging
        in a year-long, illicit, erotic love affair with a vacationing neighbor
        - wealthy Chicago industrialist/millionaire Neil Latimer (David Brian),
        while he was at his luxurious Latimer Lodge hunting facility  near her
        hometown. She attempted to sexually entice and entrap him. However, after
        the promiscuous Rosa discovered that she was pregnant by her husband,
        she was forced to shoot and kill Latimer's cabin caretaker Moose Lawson
        (Minor Watson) to silence him, so that she could run away to Chicago
        with Latimer, who had reversed himself and now wanted to marry her. A
        coroner's inquest found her not guilty for the 'accidental' death, while
        she continued to keep the pregnancy a secret from Latimer. In fact, she
        attempted to abort her baby with an attorney (the result of a strange
        censorship demand) - then successfully induced a miscarriage by jumping
        down an embankment. Half-crazy, mad, feverish, and suffering from blood
        poisoning (peritonitis), she frantically continued to try to escape to
        Chicago to meet up with Latimer. Near the train station, she collapsed
        and died an agonizing death in the roadway before getting to the boarding
        platform.</font></p>          </td>

        This all-time great boxing film and taut morality tale had six Academy
            Award nominations (and one win for Best Film Editing), including
            Best Actor for Kirk Douglas in a star-making role. It was based on
            the short story <i>Champion</i> by Ring Lardner that appeared 
			in <i>Metropolitan</i> magazine in 1916. The story told about the ups and
			downs in the life of ruthless, loud-mouthed, thuggish, working-class
			boxing champ Michael &quot;Midge&quot; Kelly (Kirk Douglas) - seen in flashback. With his
          partially-disabled, crippled brother Connie (Arthur Kennedy), Midge
          was hitching westward and ended up in Kansas City after being picked
          up by boxer Johnny Dunne (John Day) and his good-time girlfriend Grace
          Diamond (Marilyn Maxwell). Midge was encouraged to enter a boxing match
          event for $35, and although beaten in the four-round bout, his raw
          talent attracted the attention of his future manager from LA named
          Tommy Haley (Paul Stewart). Later in Malibu, California, Midge was
          forced to marry waitress Emma Bryce (Ruth Roman) after getting her
          pregnant - a shotgun marriage demanded by Emma's enraged father. Shortly
          after, he deserted her and located retired trainer Haley in an LA gym,
          and began working his way up in the boxing ranks by winning matches.
          Although Haley ordered him to take a dive in a fight against top opponent
          Johnny Dunne, he knocked Dunne out in the first round. For his disobedience,
          he was viciously beaten by his irate handlers and other organized
          mob members. He began a relationship with seductive gold-digger Grace,
          an opportunistic moll who was secretly working for Jerome Harris
          (Luis Van Rooten), Dunne's promoter and manager (with ties to criminals),
          who eventually persuaded Midge to switch managers and abandon Haley.
          Midge was also having an affair with naive and spoiled Palmer Harris
          (Lola Albright), Harris' sculptor wife. Harris made a deal with Midge
          to end his affair with his wife Palmer, by forgiving  his debts -
            and Midge agreed, breaking Palmer's heart. All along in his career
            and personal life, Midge continued to throw away his moral principles.
          He cruelly alienated, abused and mistreated all of his friends and
          family (and even the mob) who had stood by him, including his mother, Connie
          (now engaged to  Emma, whom Midge raped off-screen before her divorce
          was final) and Palmer. With Haley rehired as his trainer-manager, he
          prepared to defend his championship title against comeback fighter
          Dunne. During the final rematch, it became a brutal fight. Midge was
          knocked down twice and had a severely-cut eye, but he fought to the
          end and knocked out Dunne in the last round. But
            then, bloodied and victorious, a triumphant Midge - with a battered
            face - collapsed and died of a brain hemorrhage in his dressing room.
            In the last line of the film, Connie faintly praised his brother

          <p><font size="2"><b>Criss Cross (1949)</b>, 84 minutes, D. Robert
            Siodmak<b><br />
            </b>This under-rated, fatalistic film noir from director Robert Siodmak
            featured unreliable characters, tenuous relationships, a diabolical
            and fatal love triangle marked by obsessive and doomed love, betrayal,
            and twisting plots. It was told with one major flashback and a self-deluding
            voice-over narration. Its tagline referred to the film's double
            double-cross: &quot;When you Double-Cross
            a Double-Crosser...IT'S A CRISS-CROSS!&quot; Under the title credits,
            the film opened with a striking aerial panoramic view of nighttime
            Los Angeles before the camera swooped down to a parking lot in
            the northern part of downtown LA where a doomed couple's trysting
            embrace was revealed by glaring headlights, near the Round-Up Bar.
            They were speaking about meeting up at a Palos Verdes cottage after
            a daring, unspecified plot that would unfold the next day. In a lengthy
             flashback, it told how love-sick, still-obsessed and infatuated
            ex-husband Steve Thompson (Burt Lancaster) had returned to his
            LA family two years after a 7-month marriage to calculating <i>femme
              fatale</i> Anna Dundee (Yvonne DeCarlo) before they divorced. He was again snared
            into her web in the Round-Up nightclub, when he saw his ex-wife
            dancing the rhumba (to the tune &quot;Jungle
            Fantasy&quot;) with an unnamed partner (an unbilled Tony Curtis in his screen debut).
            Steve fatefully brooded: &quot;Anna. What was the use? I knew one way
            or the other somehow I'd wind up seeing her that night.&quot; They
            rekindled their love after they took a swim in the early morning
            at Zuma Beach. Steve was warned to stay away from the temptress by
            his mother (Edna Holland). LAPD Lt. Pete Ramirez (Stephen McNally)
            also pressured Anna to leave town, when Anna suddenly eloped to marry
            abusive, crooked gangster boyfriend Slim Dundee (Dan Duryea). Nonetheless,
            Steve met up with her again and continued to engage in a clandestine
            affair. When caught together alone by Slim and his gang, Steve tried
            to deflect attention regarding their relationship. He quickly hatched
            a plan with Slim for a daytime payroll heist plan. Steve was expecting
            to double-cross Slim and escape with Anna after the robbery, but
            everything went horribly wrong - Steve shot Slim in
            the leg, but then was badly wounded himself. The gang fled with the
            money. Afterwards while he recovered in a hospital, Steve was viewed
            as a hero. In the film's dark, fatalistic and morbid finale, the
            still-recuperating Steve was taken from his hospital room in the
            middle of the night and driven to meet with Anna in their seaside
            Palos Verdes rendezvous. When Anna realized how weak he was, she
            became aggravated with Steve for spoiling their getaway, and began
            to think only of her own survival - she planned to quickly pack up
            and desert him. Slim had traced them to their seaside Palos Verdes
            rendezvous. He entered, taunted Steve: &quot;You won out, Thompson. You've
            got her. She's all yours now,&quot; and then mercilessly gunned down both
            Anna and Steve with three gunshots, turned, and heard police sirens
            in the distance. </font></p></td>

          Warner Bros' black and white drama was based upon Ayn Rand's 1943 best-selling
              novel of the same name, who was hired to write the screenplay for
              the fictional film. The main thesis of the didactic book and film
              was the idea that individualism was superior to collectivism, conformity,
              and conventional interests, a notion known as Objectivism. The
              film's main character (modeled after famous architect Frank Lloyd
              Wright) that embodied pure individualism was visionary and uncompromising
              architect Howard Roark (Gary Cooper), who had been dismissed by
              an architectural school Dean (Paul Stanton) for being far too individualistic
              and for exhibiting originality. In contrast, opportunist fellow
              student Peter Keating (Kent Smith) planned on making a fortune
              as a hack architect by compromising and giving the public what
              they wanted. Roark's first employer Henry Cameron (Henry Hull)
              also advised Roark to compromise and give in to public tastes.
              As predicted, Roark faced little success and was doomed to fail
              in a world where individualism was detested. Later in the film
              as contrast, the city's newspaper <i>The Banner</i> had
              become a powerful and successful newspaper by catering to the public's
              cheap and tawdry tastes. Ellsworth Toohey (Robert Douglas), the
              architecture critic for <i>The Banner</i>, and the paper's publishing
              magnate Gail Wynand (Raymond Massey) had become rich and powerful
              due to their appeal to the masses. In contrast, socialite Dominique
              Francon (Patricia Neal) who was also a <i>Banner</i> columnist,
              admired Roark's designs and opposed the paper's campaign against
              him. Dominique was engaged to marry successful architect Peter Keating, at the
              same time that Wynand was in love with her. In the conclusion,
              Dominique was in a loveless marriage to Wynand, while Keating sought
              help from Roark to provide the design for a massive low-cost public
              housing project known as Cortlandt Homes. The resultant buildings
              (with unauthorized design changes to Roark's original design) were
              ugly, tasteless, and compositionally awkward. Feeling that the
              project had perverted his design, Roark dynamited the project.
              After his arrest and during his trial, Roark single-handedly delivered
              a powerful and convincing courtroom speech to vindicate himself
              and chastise collectivism: (&quot;The world is perishing in an orgy
              of self-sacrificing&quot;) - and he was ruled not-guilty by the jury.
              A guilt-stricken Wynand, who had publically condemned Roark, now
              rewarded him with a contract to design a massive building in his
              own honor, and then committed suicide with a gun. The climax came
              with the reunion of Dominique (who had earlier already left her
              husband and was now Mrs. Roark) and Roark triumphantly atop his
              new, under-construction and unique Wynand Building skyscraper.</font> </p>        </td>

            William Wyler's great but bleak romantic drama featured an icy musical
            score from Aaron Copland - it was based on Henry James' 1880 novella <em>Washington
            Square </em>and the 1946 play by Ruth and Augustus Goetz. It was
            remade as a TV movie in 1961, and also as <i>Washington Square
            (1997)</i> by director Agnieszka Holland, starring
            Jennifer Jason Leigh. In mid-19th century New
            York City (Greenwich Village), a plain, repressed, shy and virginal
            'heiress' daughter Catherine Sloper (Oscar-winning Olivia de Havilland)
            lived with her wealthy, arrogant, imperiously abusive, and domineering,
            widowed, patriarchal physician-father Dr. Sloper (Ralph Richardson)
            in a luxurious townhouse. Also in the house was Catherine's Aunt
            and confidante, Lavinia Penniman (Miriam Hopkins). Catherine remained
            a spinster, after her young, first love toward a handsome, but penniless,
            mysterious suitor and mercenary, scheming Morris Townsend (Montgomery
            Clift) (although with ambiguous motivations - was he or wasn't he
            a fortune hunter?) was thwarted by her stern, tyrannically-selfish
            father. Her imperious and abusive father threatened to deny the bride-to-be
              her full inheritance. Pitifully, she was also jilted on the night
            of their elopement by Townsend. Over many years, her anger was suppressed
              and simmered, and surfaced when insincere scoundrel and playboyish
              gold-digger Townsend returned and again asked for her hand in marriage.
              With rational, cold, controlled rage for all her years of mistreatment,
            she turned the tables on him in the final, chilling scene.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Robert Hamer<br />
              The film was loosely based on Roy Harniman's 1907 novel <i>Israel Rank: The
              Autobiography of a Criminal</i>. The title was taken from a verse in Tennyson's 1942 poem  
              <i>Lady Clara Vere de Vere</i>. In this morbid and ultra-black
              Ealing classic comedy about inheritance in Edwardian England by
              director Robert Hamer, the versatile Alec Guinness (in his third
              film role) starred with a virtuoso performance as all <i>eight</i> of
              the victimized members of the effete, aristocratic D'Ascoyne family
              (including Lady Agatha!) as they were killed one by one. All of
              the aristocratic family relatives were pictured in the title screen
              (young and old, and male and female -- a General, a snob, a young
              photographer, a suffragette, an Admiral, a Parson, a Banker and
              the Duke). The many heirs stood in the way of cold-blooded serial
              killer and impoverished, embittered commoner Louis Mazzini (Dennis
              Price) - a distant poor relative and the ninth in line to inherit
              the Dukedom of Chalfont. The scheming Mazzini's intent was to murder
              all the other rival successors and competing heirs, to become the
              new Duke of D'Ascoyne. Vengeful and greedy, and while in prison
              and about to be executed for a murder he didn't commit (of Lionel
              Holland (John Penrose)), he flashbacked to his earlier days (&quot;In
              those days, I never had any trouble with the sixth commandment&quot;)
              and he told about his parents:  his opera-singing father
              died when seeing his newborn child for the first time,
              while his disinherited, ostracized widowed mother (a member of
              the high-born D'Ascoyne family) was
              killed by a train (and refused a burial in the family vault at
              Chalfont). The murders occurred in this order: snobbish Ascoyne
              d'Ascoyne (by drowning in a boating accident), young Henry d'Ascoyne
              (by fire in a photographic darkroom), Reverend Lord Henry d'Ascoyne
              (The Parson) (by poison), suffragette Lady Agatha d'Ascoyne (by
              fall in hot-air balloon), Admiral Lord Horatio d'Ascoyne (The Admiral)
              (not murdered, died in naval accident), General Lord Rufus d'Ascoyne
              (The General) (by bomb explosion), Lord d'Ascoyne Ethelred (The
              Duke) (by gunshot while caught in a trap), and Lord Henry d'Ascoyne,
              Sr. (The Banker) (by fatal heart attack). In  the satirical and
              memorable twist ending, Mazzini was released from prison to a cheering
              crowd (due to perjured testimony and a deal with the victim's widow
              Sibelia Holland (Joan Greenwood)). He was approached by a <i>Tit-Bits</i> reporter
              (Arthur Lowe) who asked: &quot;I represent the magazine <i>Tit-Bits</i> by
              whom I'm commissioned to approach you for the publication rights
              of your memoirs.&quot;  Mazzini paused for a second, then replied: &quot;My
              memoirs? Oh, my memoirs. My memoirs&quot; -- he glanced
              backward, and was reminded that he had left a self-incriminating
              memoirs document on his desk in his cell - the camera tracked back
              to his cell and the pile of his papers that would reveal his guilt. </font></p></td>

            D: Nicholas Ray <br />
            </font><font size="2">Nicholas Ray's 'social
            problem' drama was based upon the best-selling book by Willard Motley.
            Nick &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Romano (John Derek), a mal-adjusted and frequent lawbreaker, was charged with
            the crime of robbery in the 380 Bar, and the cold-blooded murder
            of police Officer Dan Hawkins (Thomas Sully) during flight. Prominent
            Attorney Andrew Morton (Humphrey Bogart) reluctantly agreed to
            defend Romano, while the District Attorney was Kerman (George
            Macready). Judge Drake (Barry Kelly) presided. The
            DA argued that Romano was a black-hearted murderer that deserved
            to be executed. Morton, who grew up with the same hardship conditions
            as Romano, counter-argued with a simplistic defense plea that
            emphasized the evil of the slums, where Romano had been raised. In
            flashback, it was shown that years earlier, Morton's law firm had
            improperly defended Nick's innocent, Italian immigrant grocer father,
            who was sent to prison and died there. Romano's disadvantaged family
            was forced to move to the slums, where young disenfranchised
            Nick lived in poverty, was sent to a reform school, gambled himself
            into debt, met the wrong people, and joined a violent criminal
            gang. After Nick's wife Emma (Allene Roberts) became pregnant,
            he fled, and when he returned, he found that she had committed
            suicide (by asphyxiation in a gas oven). He turned to robbery
            and held up a train station. At the conclusion of his opening statements,
            slightly guilt-ridden Morton stated that Romano was not the
            murderer. DA Kerman summoned some unreliable, uncredible eyewitness
            to the stand who claimed they had seen Nick: (1) victimized 380 Bar
            bartender Carl Swanson (Vince Barnett), (2) homeless bum Kid Fingers
            Carnahan (Jimmy Conlin). Their testimonies were discredited by Morton.
            An accusatory statement by Juan Rodriguez (Pepe Hern) was obtained
            under duress - Rodriguez was coerced by being threatened with
            deportation by police. Two of Morton's witnesses provided Nick with
            an alibi - they were drinking beer at the time of the crime. Under
            fierce cross-examination on the stand, Nick (who shouldn't have been
            allowed
                  to testify) caved to pressure by Kerman (who screamed &quot;murderer&quot; at
                  him), especially when he was accused of causing his wife Emma's
                  suicide. Romano broke down and confessed to the robbery and
                  murder. In the final moments of the trial, liberal-minded attorney
                  Morton emotionally pleaded for leniency and mercy from the
                  jury regarding Nick's admission of guilt, arguing that his
                  social upbringing and failures of the justice system had caused
                  his life of crime, but his pleas were unsuccessful. Nick was
                  sentenced to death (by electric chair) by the Judge. </font></p></td>

        and Stanley Donen<br />
        This fresh, energetic, kinetic and innovative landmark MGM musical
        was co-directed by Stanley Donen and dancer/choreographer Gene Kelly
        (together, they directed three MGM post-war musicals) - his directorial
        debut, featured lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and Leonard
        Bernstein's music from the Broadway stage musical of 1944. This exuberant
        musical masterpiece won the Oscar for Best Musical Score. It took the
        musical out of the wall-bound studio and on location into New York City
        (with all the prominent sites) - the first time that actual locations
        were used for musical numbers. The movie was also noted as the third
        and final pairing of  musical stars Gene Kelly and Frank
        Sinatra. Most of the film was composed of
        dances of a trio of sailors in the NYC streets (often with their
        three female companions joining with them).  The sailors were always
        dressed in white, and each of the females was represented by a different
        color scheme - Claire (green), Hildy (yellow), and Ivy (pink). It
        opened with the show-stopping, two and a half-minute song-and-dance number &quot;New
        York, New York (It's a Hell of a Town).&quot; The lively
            musical was a story about three on-leave sailors, Gabey (Gene Kelly),
            shy Chip (Frank Sinatra) and Ozzie (Jules Munshin), who were looking
            for romance during a 24-hour shore leave/furlough after docking
            in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Together, they  experienced all the
            sights of the city with their new girlfriends: lust-crazed female
        Globe cab driver Hildy Esterhazy (Betty Garrett) (who advanced on the
        very shy Chip in &quot;Come
            Up to My Place&quot;), sexy toe-tapping anthropologist  Claire Huddesen
            (Ann Miller) (whom Ozzie met in the fictional Museum of Anthropological
            History) where they performed the song/dance &quot;Prehistoric Man&quot; (also
            one of the museum's displays), and ballet dancer
			'Miss Turnstiles' (subway ad 'dream girl'), actually
            named Ivy Smith (Vera-Ellen) -  performed a traditional boy-meets-girl
            duet with Gabey in &quot;Main Street,&quot; and later appeared 
			with him in a stylized and innovative dream sequence
            titled &quot;A Day in New York.&quot; The climactic title number &quot;On
            the Town&quot; was performed by the three couples on the Empire State
            Building's open rooftop and then on a wide street-level sidewalk.
            The final scene was the reunion between Gabey and Ivy on Coney Island
            where he found her performing as a cooch dancer at a Middle Eastern
            concession (in order to pay for her ballet lessons), before the three
            sailors dressed in drag to evade the police while being chased. They
            were captured by the shore patrol and taken back to their ship that
            was scheduled to depart at 6 AM (24 hours after their leave began).
            Fortunately, the three girlfriends caught up to them on the dock
            just before they left, and offered lots of kisses, embraces, and
            goodbye waves, with a reprise of &quot;New York, New York&quot; (by
            a new trio of sailors leaving the ship). </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Reckless Moment (1949)</strong>, 82 minutes,
              D: Max Ophuls<br />
              Director Max Ophuls' taut domestic noirish 'woman's melodrama'
              and thriller, with stark shadowy cinematography (by Burnett Guffey),
              was his fourth and final Hollywood film before returning to Europe.
              Ophuls was known for  trademark long and fluid takes, deep-focus,
              and subtle mise-en-scene. Slightly similar in theme to <i><a href="mild.html">Mildred
              Pierce (1945)</a></i>, the story was adapted from Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's 1947 &quot;The
              Blank Wall&quot; originally published in the <i>Ladies Home Journal</i>.
              It was remade as <i>The Deep End (2001)</i>, by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, with
              star Tilda Swinton. It was set in a small, sleepy beach-seaside
              community (Balboa) 50 miles from Los Angeles. Upper middle-class,
              chain-smoking, bespectacled, and sheltered housewife Lucia Harper
              (Joan Bennett) (with her patriarchal husband Tom (Henry O'Neill)
              noticeably absent and away on business in Berlin, Germany) mistakenly
              believed that her arrogant, nail-biting, and impetuous 17 year-old
              daughter Beatrice or &quot;Bea&quot; (Geraldine Brooks), an LA
              art school student, had killed her slimy, older lover Ted Darby
              (Shepperd Strudwick). In reality, Darby accidentally died (a case
              of manslaughter) during a clandestine meeting with Bea in a boathouse.
              When Bea angrily hit Darby in the head with a flashlight, he tripped,
              lost his balance and fell onto a large boat anchor. In a panic
              and &quot;reckless moment,&quot; the determined, frantic, devoted and selfless mother
              (to defend her domesticity and family from scandal) dumped the
              body in a lagoon (with the anchor), but the corpse washed ashore
              and was discovered. Afterwards, suave, small-time Irish crook Martin
              Donnelly (James Mason in his third US film) visited Lucia to blackmail
              her (for $5,000 hush money), on behalf of his tough boss-partner
              Nagel (Roy Roberts), a loan shark with incriminating love letters
              that Bea had written to Ted. Although Martin soon became infatuated
              with Lucia, his dangerous and unprincipled partner continued to
              pressure him and demand payment. Feeling entrapped by lies and
              deception, neurotic woman-in-peril Lucia attempted to raise the
              funds (at first she was unsuccessful in securing a loan from a
              bank), and resorted to pawning her jewelry (for only $800), with
              Donnelly in tow. In the stirring conclusion, Donnelly decided to
              defend Lucia against Nagel. Although stabbed, Donnelly choked Nagel
              to death. As he was dying after a car crash during his departure,
              Donnelly returned the love letters and assured Lucia that he would
              take the blame for the deaths of Darby and Nagel. The film ended,
              as Lucia phoned her distant husband and assured him that everything
              would be fine once he returned home. </font></p>        </td>

          <font size="2"><b>Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)</b>, 110 minutes, D:
              Allan Dwan<br />
              Director Allan Dwan's revisionistic, politically-correct, blatantly-patriotric,
              historically-inaccurate action-war drama was made after the war
              by Republic Studios. The film's backdrop was
            of the training and preparation required of the US Marine recruits
            before they landed on Iwo Jima in 1945. Specifically, it followed
            the  conflicts that emerged between two individuals
            in particular, a war of words and values between Sgt. Stryker  (Oscar-nominated
              John Wayne, his first Academy Award Best Actor nomination) and
              PFC Peter Conway (John Agar). The film's opening was accompanied
              by the playing and singing of the Marines' Hymn (&quot;From the
              Halls of Montezuma To the shores of Tripoli...&quot;),
              followed by an appreciative scrolling tribute to the brave
              members of the Marine Corps and for their help in the making of
              the film.  Tough, battle-hardened and harsh Marine Sergeant
            John M. Stryker   addressed his combat
            soldiers  in New Zealand in
            1943 - a new batch of rebellious greenhorn recruits-troops to fight
            in the Pacific theatre of the war as a rifle squad. Although he would
              exhaust the recruits with his rough training methods, the infamous
              commander was determined to mold them into fighting men; his
            strict expectations were echoed in his commands to a rifle squad.
               The gung-ho Stryker repeatedly used the phrase: 
          &quot;Saddle up!&quot; to get his platoon of soldiers moving. One of
          Stryker's men was Pfc Peter Conway - the college-educated son of Colonel
          Sam Conway (Stryker's deceased former commanding officer at Guadalcanal)
          who was killed 10 months earlier. Conway felt that his commanding officer
          Stryker was similar to his demanding father, who had shamed him, thought
          he wasn't tough enough, and had considered him cowardly and inferior.
          The two often sparred with each other. Five years earlier,  the hard-nosed
          Sgt. Stryker had separated from his wife Mary and now 10 year-old son
          (who failed to write to him), and had become embittered with life,
          when his ex-wife took full custody. He began drinking, and often took
              out his frustrations on the men under his command. During the brutal
          November 1943 assault on the Japanese base at Tarawa atoll, Stryker's
          unit landed on the beach head, but they were faced by non-stop machine-gunfire
          from a bunker that slaughtered many of the men. Stryker took it upon
          himself to single-handedly race forward, grab the satchel charges (from
          a downed soldier) and toss them into the bunker - and he successfully
          blew it up. Later that night as Stryker's men guarded  the
            main approach to the beachhead, the faint voice of badly-wounded
          comrade Pfc. Charlie Bass (James Brown) could be heard calling out &quot;Corpsman&quot; and
          then &quot;Stryker,&quot; but Stryker at first thought it might be
          a &quot;Jap trick&quot; and then feared that helping him would tip
          off their whereabouts to the Japanese enemy. Pfc Conway - who wanted
          to rescue Bass, was told by Stryker that he would be shot if he attempted
          a rescue. Ironically, Conway proved his manhood and worth
          by heroically saving Stryker's life during a difficult landing
          on the rocky cliffs of Japan's island of Iwo Jima, when Stryker
          was unexpectedly jumped by a Japanese soldier with a sword. Conway
          jumped in to defend Stryker by stabbing the enemy to death. Afterwards,
          the two established a strong friendship and bond. Conway also told
          Stryker that he was going to name his son Sam after his father: (&quot;We're
            gonna name him Sam, Sam Conway&quot;). In an unexpected scene, Stryker
            died an unheroic death from a random bullet. He had just completed
            the strategic assault on the volcanic Japanese island fortress of
            Iwo Jima, and had paused to relax with a cigarette after having just
            told fellow Marine Conway: &quot;As a matter of fact, I never felt
            so good in my life.&quot; He was asking: &quot;How about a cigarette?&quot; -
            when he was shot and killed by a Japanese sniper in an underground
            spider hole. As Conway embraced Stryker's dead body,  he
          discovered an undelivered and unfinished letter written by Stryker
             to explain himself to his son. It was a somber and dramatic moment
            as Conway emotionally read the letter
          out-loud. The letter abruptly ended unfinished: &quot;I guess he never
           finished it,&quot; but Conway promised to finish it. The
            film's last line (accompanied by the singing of The Marines' Hymn)
            was delivered by Conway (using Stryker's words) - it was heard with
            the memorable raising of the flag (&quot;There she goes&quot;) on
            Mount Suribachi in February of 1945: &quot;All right! Saddle up!
            Let's get back in the war!&quot;</font></td>

              D: John Ford<br />
              This was the second of director John Ford's &quot;cavalry trilogy&quot; series
              (and his personal favorite, preceded by <i>Fort Apache (1948)</i> and
              followed by <i>Rio Grande (1950)</i> which were in black and white,
              and all starring John Wayne), filmed in his favorite scenic locale
              - Monument Valley. The RKO hit film was noted for Winton C. Hoch's
              beautiful Oscar-winning Technicolor cinematography (the film's
              sole nomination and win). Ford's autumnal and sentimental western
              starred John Wayne as an aging cavalry captain named Nathan Brittles,
              serving in 1876 at Fort Starke, a one-troop cavalry post.
              After Custer's Last Stand, an allied group of native Americans
              were on the warpath, including Arapaho and Cheyenne. In
              an early sunset scene, soon-to-be retired (in six days) Capt. Brittles
              sat at the gravestone of his deceased 33 year-old wife Mary Cutting
            Brittles and spoke to her while he watered the flowers. The fort
              was commanded by Major &quot;Mac&quot; Allshard (George O'Brien),
              who ordered Brittles (on his last patrol mission) to protectively
              accompany two women: his own no-nonsense wife Abby 'Old Iron Pants'
              Allshard (Mildred Natwick) and Mrs. Allshard's niece - attractive,
              genteel single lady Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru). They were being
              evacuated for their own safety to an awaiting stagecoach station
              at Sudro's Well to take an eastbound stagecoach. Olivia was being
              pursued by two rival lieutenants in the fort: Brittles' pending
              replacement Lieutenant Flint Cohill (John Agar) and arrogant 2nd
              Lieutenant Ross Pennell (Harry Carey, Jr.). She wore a 'yellow
              ribbon' in her hair signifying that she had chosen a &quot;sweetheart&quot; -
              although the two fought over her affections (Cohill). Captain Brittles
              was joined on the trip by Major Allshard, shrewd chief scout Sgt.
              Tyree (Ben Johnson), and often-drunk and comical First Sgt. Quincannon
              (Victor McLaglen). The women and the wagons slowed down their trip,
               and so did a detour when they had to give a &quot;wide berth&quot;
              to a group of migrating Arapahos. As the regiment approached the
               Sudro stage depot, they discovered that the Indians (a mixed group
               of Cheyenne and Arapaho) had massacred the stage master John Sudro
               and his wife Martha (leaving their two young children Palmer and
               Carey Sue orphaned), and lethally-wounded brave trooper Pvt.
               John Smith/Rome Clay (Rudy Bowman) who had helped to defend the
              depot. The patrol was forced to make an arduous,  return
              march to the Fort, planned for the middle of the night. After returning
              to the fort, Captain Brittles told Maj. Allshard that he considered
               the mission that he had been leading a complete failure: &quot;Failed
               at Sudro's. Failed to keep Rynders' rifles from the tribes. Failed
              at everything. I leave the Army a failure.&quot; On the next day,
              his last day before retirement in a farewell scene, Brittles'
              C Troop awarded him with a solid silver pocketwatch with the inscription: &quot;To
              Captain Brittles. From C Troop Lest we forget&quot; that he tearfully
              and proudly read with his glasses. With only four hours left before
              his retirement officially began, Capt. Brittles chose to intervene
              in an impending Indian war. Accompanied by Sgt. Tyree,
              Brittles met under a truce flag with his
              elderly friend - Cheyenne Indian Chief Pony That Walks (Chief John
              Big Tree), and vainly tried to dissuade the Indians from war. Brittles
              chose a risky strategy of stampeding the Indians' horses out of
              their camp just before midnight (and just before his civilian life
              officially began), to prevent battle in an inevitable and bloody
              war against US troops, and to force them to return to their reservation
              on foot. Then, although officially retired and heading westward,
              Brittles was recalled back to duty (&quot;But the Army hadn't fiinished
              with Brittles&quot;) by the Yankee War Department - with a promotion
              as Lieutenant Colonel and appointment as Chief of the Civilian
              Scouts. The film ended with Brittles receiving praise from everyone
              at the fort. As a celebratory dance commenced, Brittles walked
              to the gravesite of his wife to quietly sit. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Carol Reed<br />
              Carol Reed's British visually-stylish <em>film noir</em> thriller
              - a paranoid story of social, economic, and moral corruption -
              has been widely acclaimed as an effective suspenser and one of
              the best films of all-time. It was adapted from Graham Greene's
              novella written to prepare the film's screenplay, then later published.
              With a haunting zither musical score and theme from Anton Karas,
              and innovative b/w camera-work (by Robert Krasker) to accentuate
              the gloomy, depressed, rotting and sinister atmosphere. Unusually
               reckless, canted camera angles (one of
              their earliest uses), and wide-angle lens distortions amidst the
              atmospheric on-location views of a shadowy Vienna cast a somber
              mood over the fable of post-war moral ambiguity and ambivalent
              redemption. The deliberately unsettling, tilted angles reflected
              the state of the ruined, fractured and dark city - ravaged, crumbling
              and desperate during the Cold War, and split among the occupying
              forces. Vienna was also filled with black marketeers, spies, refugees,
              thieves, and foreign powers seeking control. A pulp Western 
			  novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten)
              arrived in Vienna, totally broke and hoping to find employment.
              He was forced to assume the role of an amateur sleuth as he looked
              for old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) who had reportedly been
              killed in Vienna in a car accident days earlier - although there
              were mysterious circumstances surrounding the incident. He sought
              to unravel the mystery of the presumed-dead friend with a probing
              search, and an infatuation with Lime's actress girlfriend Anna
              Schmidt (Alida Valli). The first appearance of Lime was in a doorway,
              as a light suddenly illuminated his sardonic smile. He ultimately
              learned that Lime was a vile, unscrupulous and notorious black-market
              drug dealer who preyed on the sick with diluted penicillin. The
              great thriller included the dramatic scene atop a ferris wheel
              (with the famed &quot;Swiss cuckoo clock&quot; dialogue),
              a suspenseful manhunt led by Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) into
              the underground city sewers for Lime - a shadowy, marked man, and
              the famed ending of Anna's stoic shunning of Martins on a cemetery
              road while remaining loyal to Lime.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Twelve O'Clock High (1949), </b>132 minutes, D:
        Henry King<br />
        This great and realistic war film about leadership was 
        a superb and enthralling character study emphasizing the stress encountered
        by various WWII officers who led US forces into combat. Although effective
        against the German Nazis, the heavy bombing raids in a hot combat zone
        took a horrendous, self-destructive, emotional and physical toll on fliers
        and aircraft. The terrifying and dangerous air raids were dramatically
        photographed in numerous aerial sequences. This
            timely, tense and compelling film was told in flashback (from the
              year 1949, looking back to 1942) by middle-aged, introspective
              American tourist Harvey Stovall (Dean Jagger) who was visiting
        an abandoned airstrip in England. Years earlier, he had served with the
        struggling 918th Bomb Group (of the US Eighth Air Force) of B-12 bombers
        based at Archbury, England in late 1942. He recalled when Brig.
          Gen. Frank Savage (Gregory Peck), a  tough, hard-as-nails, discipline-oriented
          commander was assigned to the unit. [Note:
            Peck's character was based on Colonel Frank Armstrong, Jr. whose
              exploits in whipping into shape the real-life 306th Bombardment
              Group at Thurleigh Field in England were documented in the 1948
              novel of the same name by the film's scriptwriters Sy Bartlett
        and Beirne Lay, Jr.] Known as a very strict, harsh and by-the-book officer,
        Savage replaced compassionate, soft-hearted but popular predecessor
          Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) who had been relieved of his
          duty after resisting to send his men on another near-suicidal, low-altitude
          daytime mission. At first, the scarred, hard-luck men with low morale
        resented and detested the personal style of their stern replacement commander
          who insisted on discipline, and many of them threatened to be transferred.
          However, they gradually learned to respect him. Over time, Savage 
         began to over-identify with his beleaguered men, and suffered from
        the same effects that doomed Davenport. In the stressful atmosphere of
        uncertainty, risk and danger, he began to act erratically, went into
        shock and had a nervous breakdown during a mission. </font></p>        </td>

                Island)</strong>,
              D: Alexander Mackendrick<br />
              Alexander Mackendrick's directorial debut film came with this
              Ealing Studios release - a droll, fast-paced, black-and-white British
              comedy that was well-revered,  based on the light-hearted 1947
              novel by Scottish novelist Compton Mackenzie. It was based upon
              a true story of a sunken ship in early 1941. The odd comedy 
              told about a cargo of whiskey, 50,000 cases, on  the steamship
              freighter <i>SS Cabinet Minister</i> that was shipwrecked in heavy fog off
              the rocky and remote Scottish Hebrides island of Todday during
              WWII - the tagline described: &quot;It's Light... It's Bright...
              It's 100 Proof!&quot; The tempted and thirsty locals during a time
              of war rationing, salvaged some of the precious cargo, smuggled
              it to the island, and concealed it. Among those who were enlivened
              by the cargo were the town's teetotalling, henpecked schoolteacher
              George Campbell (Gordon Jackson), his strict and domineering Calvinist
              mother Mrs. Campbell (Jean Cadell), and dying hermit Old Hector
              (James Anderson). They and other wily townsfolk made numerous devious
              attempts to circumvent the British customs revenue officials, led
              by stuffy, bureaucratic and pompous Home Guard Captain Paul Waggett
              (Basil Radford), who wanted to confiscate the find. A cat-and-mouse
              game distracted the authorities, and allowed the islanders to triumphantly
              keep their prized drink. In the film's moral epilogue, however,
              it was announced that the whiskey soon dried up, and the Todday
              islanders lived 'unhappily' ever after.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Raoul Walsh<br />
            Director Walsh's very volatile, super-charged and compelling, film-noirish
             gangster-crime film (one of the best ever made) was one of the last
            of Warner Bros.' gangster films - a full decade after their proliferation
            in the 1930s. The classic film anticipated the heist films of the
            early '50s (e.g., John Huston's  <i><a href="asph.html">The Asphalt
            Jungle (1950)</a></i> and Stanley Kubrick's
             <i><a href="killing.html">The Killing (1956)</a></i>), accentuated
             the semi-documentary style of films of the period (e.g., <i>The
             Naked City (1948)</i>), and contained film-noirish elements, 
			 including the shady black-and-white
            cinematography, the <i>femme fatale</i> character, and the twisted
            psyche of the criminal gangster. The crime drama told about a 
			psychopathic, homicidal, mother-devoted
            gangster. Crazed, eccentric, and tough-guy killer Arthur &quot;Cody&quot; Jarrett
            (James Cagney in one of his finest career performances) led a gang
            of train robbers in the High Sierras, while unnaturally and obsessively
            aided by the ministrations of his beloved, equally crooked and
            shrewd &quot;Ma&quot; Jarrett (Margaret Wycherly), the only female
            he truly loved, and the only one who could console him during excruciatingly-painful
            bouts of headaches. His treacherous wife Verna (Virginia Mayo) was
            unfaithful with rebellious gang member &quot;Big Ed&quot; Somers
            (Steve Cochran), amidst gang dissension, when Cody was briefly imprisoned
            in the Illinois State Penitentiary. When he learned of his mother's
            death, the mother-fixated, violent and warped Cody went beserk in
            the prison cafeteria. After an escape from prison during a riot,
            he fled to Southern California, where Verna assured him that &quot;Big
            Ed&quot; had shot and killed his mother (although she had committed
            the deed) - and Cody gunned him down. Then, during the
            payroll robbery of an oil refinery and chemical plant in Long Beach,
            Cody was betrayed by clever undercover agent/informant Vic Pardo/Hank
            Fallon (Edmond O'Brien). In the legendary blazing finale, a trapped
            Cody was consumed in the flames of a round-shaped holding tank
            explosion (from his own gunfire) as he proclaimed: &quot;Made
        it Ma! Top of the world!&quot;</font></p>        </td>
