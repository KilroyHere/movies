            Kaplan<br />
            This thoughtful, fact-based drama was based on a real-life incident
            of a 1983 rape in New Bedford, Massachusetts. It provided a provocative
            look at how the justice system treated victims who were often seen
            as worthy of blame. In mid-April 1987, Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster
            in an Oscar-winning role), a sexily-dressed, drunk, working-class
            patron was in The Mill, a seedy roadside bar, following a fight with
            her live-in boyfriend Larry (Tom O'Brien) - he was a drug dealer
            and would-be musician. A bruised, still-intoxicated and half-dressed
            Sarah ran barefoot and screaming from the roadside bar where she'd
            just been raped by three men on a pinball machine. Prosecuting Deputy
            D.A. Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) took the case, and thought her
            only chances were a plea bargain with the brutal gang-rapists. She
            knew she couldn't get a conviction, because Sarah would be unfairly
            accused of enticing her attackers: &quot;Raped? She f--ked a bar
            full of guys then she turns round and blames them for it?&quot; The
            three rapists agreed to plea guilty to &quot;reckless endangerment&quot; instead
            of rape, with a lesser sentence of no more than 9 months in jail.
            They were Danny (Woody Brown), Bob Joiner (Steve Antin), and Kurt
            (Kim Kondrashoff). To satisfy Tobias who disagreed vehemently with
            her tactics and felt betrayed, Murphy further pursued the case by
            prosecuting three of the onlooking bystanders for &quot;criminal
            solicitation&quot; - for inciting or encouraging others to commit a crime. However, she was
      unsupported by DA Paul Rudolph (Carmen Argenziano). College-frat
      student Kenneth Joyce (Bernie Coulson) was the key witness who saw the
      rape (and had watched the encouraging bystanders), but was initially reluctant
              to testify. He then agreed since his testimony was the crux of
              the case. He had called 911, but did not personally intervene during
              the incident. The entire rape episode was voyeuristically envisioned
              during the lengthy witness recounting (on Sarah's behalf), describing
              how the three barflies cheered on the rapists. Murphy presented
              a forceful court argument against the men
              who encouraged the rape of her client: &quot;These three men did worse than nothing. They cheered, and
              they clapped, and they rooted the others on. They made sure that
              Sarah Tobias was raped, and raped, and raped. Now you tell me,
              is that nothing?&quot; The three who were convicted: Cliff 'Scorpion'
              Albrect (Leo Rossi), Matthew Haines (Andrew Kavadas), and Stu Holloway
          (Tom McBeath). </font></p>        </td>

            with glowing red eyes and a sign lit up: ZOLTAR SAYS - MAKE YOUR
            WISH. He made a wish to be 'big' (&quot;I wish I were big&quot;).
            He received a card - from the strangely unplugged machine - telling
            him: &quot;Your Wish is Granted&quot; but didn't feel anything different.
            The next morning, Josh became panicked when he realized, in front
            of his bathroom mirror, that he was a full-grown, unrecognizable
            young adult male (now Tom Hanks as a 30 year-old). His freaked-out
            mother (Mercedes Ruehl) didn't recognize him and thought he was an
            intruder-kidnapper. Fortunately, at his school, he was able to convince
            Billy Kopecki (Jared Rushton), his next-door neighbor and best friend,
            of his predicament.  The two rode together on a bus to New York
            City, and slept in a flophouse. Josh successfully
            applied for a computer operator data-entry job at the MacMillan Toy
              Company, after faking his Social Security number and his resume's
            work history. While Josh was in the main showroom of an F.A.O. Schwartz
            toy store on a weekend, he happened to meet the MacMillan
            Toys company executive boss &quot;Mac&quot; MacMillan (Robert Loggia), and
            the two enjoyed tap dancing and foot-tapping to the tunes <i>Heart and Soul</i> and <i>Chopsticks</i> on
            a giant, floor-sized and mounted electronic piano keyboard. Josh
            was ultimately promoted to toy tester in charge of Product Development; however,
              his sudden advancement upset top-level co-workers: sexy yuppie
              toy executive Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins), and her competitive
          boyfriend Paul Davenport (John Heard). Josh's humorous experiences
            in the adult world formed the bulk of the remainder of the story.
            Josh experienced a confused sexual relationship with Susan when she
            asked to spend the night with him. Paul's jealous retaliation against
            Josh for stealing Susan away led to Susan's break up with Paul. During
            a brief return to his hometown, Josh walked around his neighborhood
            and school, and noticed younger kids, including his friend Billy,
            having playful fun - he  longed to return to the simple joys of
            childhood. Eventually, Billy was able to inform
            Josh of a Zoltar machine at Sea Point Park where
            he made a wish to become a kid again. Susan followed after him and
            realized that Josh's earlier confession about his transformation
            was actually true, and that their relationship would be ending. In
             the conclusion, Susan drove Josh home, and outside his house she
            kissed his forehead before they parted ways; there was a poignant
            final shot of Susan watching Josh, who waved goodbye. He   
            transformed into a 13 year-old boy again (with clothes that now didn't
            fit him) - he ran toward his home, calling out: &quot;Mom?...I missed
            you all so much.&quot;</font></p>

              minutes, D: Ron Shelton<br />
            First-time director Ron Shelton, a former second-baser in the minor
                leagues, had made a prominent career of sports movies that
                realistically examined the participants' heart, both in terms
                of sportsmanship and in terms of romance. His writing (and directing)
                credits have also included: <em>The Best of Times (1986) </em>(football), <em>White
                Men Can't Jump (1992)</em> (basketball, also directed), <em>Blue
                Chips (1994)</em> (basketball), <em>Cobb (1994)</em> (baseball,
                also directed), <em>The Great White Hype (1996) </em>(boxing), <em>Tin
                Cup (1996)</em> (golf, also directed), and <em>Play It To the
          Bone (2000)</em> (boxing, also directed). <em>Bull
          Durham </em>would only receive a single Oscar nomination for Shelton's
          writing, while Costner's next film would be another baseball film,
          the mystical <em><a href="fiel.html">Field of Dreams (1989)</a></em>,
          based on the W.P. Kinsella book. This humorous and intelligent romantic
          sports comedy-drama about a mediocre North Carolina minor league baseball
          team (the Durham Bulls) was the quintessential modern sports film of
          America's greatest game. During  the film's opening title credits sequence,
            cultured and literate baseball and sports groupie Annie Savoy (Susan
            Sarandon, co-star Robbins' real life 'wife'), a junior-college English
          teacher and sexually-seductive baseball groupie, provided a lengthy,
          off-screen speech regarding her beloved team - the Durham Bulls of
          North Carolina. At the local ball park, Annie observed the new hotshot
          pitcher for the perennial losing team - the Durham Bulls; making his
          professional debut was moronic, erratic, dim-bulb young, up-and-coming
          rookie pitcher-ballplayer Ebby Calvin &quot;Nuke&quot; (or &quot;Meat&quot;)
          LaLoosh (Tim Robbins). 12-year veteran journeyman and minor league
          baseball catcher &quot;Crash&quot; Davis (Kevin Costner) was being returned to the
            A-league to mentor and tutor the green young upstart LaLoosh. He
             had been acquired to teach the clueless LaLoosh (who was being groomed
            for the major leagues and was worth $100 grand) how to discipline
            his behavior and improve his concentration, including his erratic
            pitches. After the game,  romantic-minded 
            Crash and Laloosh - in a love triangle - were competing
              for dating prospects with Annie and her affection, both in a local
            country-western bar and in Annie's living room, where she proposed
            to &quot;hook up with one guy a season.&quot; Shortly later, she announced her
            choice for the season - Laloosh - and told Crash: &quot;I'm committed
            to Nuke for the season. You had your chance the other day.&quot; As
            a way to combat Annie's choice of Nuke for the season, Crash convinced
            Nuke to rechannel his sexual energy into his pitching and away from
            her - depriving Annie of sexual fulfillment. Eventually, Annie began
            to realize that &quot;Crash&quot; might be a better-suited match
            for her sexual come-ons. She came to Crash's place and offered herself: &quot;I
            want you,&quot; but when he declined, she flatly stated: &quot;This
            is the damnedest season I've ever seen. I mean, the Durham Bulls
            can't lose, and I can't get laid.&quot; She had a chance to sample
            his beliefs about three-day long kisses at the conclusion of the
            film when &quot;Crash&quot; was released from baseball playing altogether
            (although he might be a minor league manager) and he sought to retire
            with dignity. He looked up Annie and then over a drink, they kissed,
            and soon made love. By the end of the film, &quot;Nuke&quot; had
            been called up and promoted to the majors. Seen one last time and
            now wearing a T-shirt for the ska-punk band Fishbone, he was being
            interviewed by TV reporter Raye Anne in a baseball stadium, using
            words and cliches that Crash had taught him: (&quot;...Anyway, a
            good friend of mine used to say, 'This is a very simple game. You
            throw the ball, you catch the ball. You hit the ball. Sometimes you
            win, sometimes you lose. Sometimes it rains.' Think about that for
            a while&quot;).</font></p>

              D: Fred Schepisi <i><b> <br />
              </b></i>The central characters in this
              docu-drama (a true life story), living in Queensland, Australia,
              were 7th-Day Adventist Church minister Michael Chamberlain
              (Sam Neill), his devout and religious wife Lindy (Meryl Streep),
              and their three children, including 10-week old infant Azaria.
              In late summer of 1980, the family took a vacation camping
              trip to the aboriginal sacred spot Ayers Rock in the central
              Australian outback. During an outdoor nighttime barbecue with
              other campers, Linda claimed that she saw a dingo (wild dog)
              carrying off her sleeping baby from their open camping tent.
              She was frantic: &quot;The dingo took my baby!&quot; After
              a search, Azaria was never found. After an initial inquest, it
              was ruled that Lindy's dingo account was true. However, the explosive
              case caused a media frenzy and unfair witch-hunt, and some theorized
              that Lindy, who appeared cold-hearted, stoic and emotionless (at
              the request of her lawyer), had carried on a ritualistic sacrifice
              of her child by decapitating the baby with a pair of scissors.
              Michael was found with a small wooden coffin used as a &quot;offering
              plate&quot; for his parishioners' packs of un-smoked cigarettes,
              fueling speculation about a sacrifice. The press also published
              the inaccurate rumor that Azaria meant &quot;sacrifice in the wilderness.&quot; When
              the police questioned Lindy more thoroughly, inconsistencies caused
              them to suspect her, and the case was reopened as a murder case.
              Her husband was charged with being an accessory. Ian
              Baker (Bruce Myles) was the case's prosecutor, while the couple
              (who testified in their own defense) were represented by Phillips
              (Neil Fitzpatrick). During the testimony in a second
                hearing, forensic experts (from London) and other academic experts
                provided lots of circumstantial evidence, but nothing conclusive.
                The infant's jumpsuit (with ripped gashes not caused by a dingo)
                was found in a cave about three miles from the campsite. There
                was conflicting and confusing evidence presented about the jumpsuit,
                and about the predatory behavior of dingos. For example, there
                were traces on infant blood in a camera case and in the family's
                car, but the causes were unclear. Professor Cameron (Kevin Miles)
                testified that there were small bloody imprints on the jumpsuit,
                and that the lack of saliva on the clothing indicated that it wasn't
                a dingo attack. He was countered by another expert who claimed
                saliva was present. In an obvious miscarriage of justice (there
                was no body, no motive, no weapon, and no hard evidence), in October
                of 1982, Lindy was found guilty of murder and sentenced to a life
                sentence - with hard labor. Michael was found guilty as an accessory
                and given an 18-month suspended sentence. Then over three years
                later, Azaria's outer jacket was found. Lindy was released from
                prison, and the case was reopened. In 1988, all convictions against
                Lindy and Michael were overturned. </font></p></td>

              Hard</em></a> film series. <br />
          Director John McTiernan's action-thriller blockbuster, based on Roderick
          Thorp's 1979 novel <em>Nothing Lasts Forever</em>,  was the first
          in a series of films stretching over a period of over 20 years, featuring
          Bruce Willis as wise-cracking, tough-guy NYC police cop John McClane
          with real human vulnerabilities. There were many breathtaking, tense,
          nail-biting action sequences in one of the best action films of all-time.
          Off-duty NYC detective/cop Lt. John McClane (Bruce Willis) took a flight
          from New York to Los Angeles, arriving on Christmas Eve 1988. He 
          planned to join his estranged wife (of six months who had relocated
          to LA) Holly Gennero/McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) at a holiday party in
          her place of business in the 40 story high-rise
          Plaza Towers in Century City (Los Angeles). He arrived in a limo driven
          by Argyle (De'voreaux White), and joined the party on the 30th floor,
          just as a large Pacific Courier truck pulled into the underground garage
          with a group of heavily-armed, hi-tech terrorists inside, led by classic
          bad-guy villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), who soon proceeded to take
          over the building. Long blonde-haired henchman Karl Vreski (Alexander
          Godunov) shot and killed both the front-desk officer and security guard;
          a second assailant named Theo (Clarence Gilyard, Jr.), a black technical-computer
          expert, sealed off the building's exits and entrances, and all but
          one elevator. The guests at the party were taken hostage, including
          McClane's wife. The company's executive officer Joe Takagi (James Shigeta)
          was executed when he refused to reveal the computer's passcodes, to
          access $640 million dollars in negotiable bearer bonds. Over the next
          few hours as the terrorists attempted to hack into the vault, McClane
          evaded capture and pursuit as he attempted to distract the gunmen by
          attacking some of them individually and sabotaging their plans. During
          tense cat-and-mouse sequences, the barefooted McClane moved from floor
          to floor, and navigated through a maze of airducts and the ventilation/elevator
          shaft. After he finally was able to successfully alert the authorities,
          the LAPD, SWAT teams, the FBI in helicopters, and a live-mobile news
          crew arrived at the scene to report on the incident of international
          terrorism. Momentarily on the roof-top together, McClane confronted
          Gruber face-to-face, who faked being one of the escaped hostages. After
          Gruber escaped, McClane suffered bloodied feet after having to walk
          through shards of sharp glass of the blasted walls. The FBI unwisely
          ordered city engineers to cut the building's power, releasing the seventh
          and final &quot;electromagnetic seal&quot; or lock on the vault
          with the bonds. The double-crossing Gruber was planning
            to blow the roof with C-4 explosives as an FBI helicopter touched
            down, to kill the hostages who had been taken there. Then, Gruber's
            next objective was to escape with the stolen bonds in an emergency
          vehicle readied for him in the basement. McClane charged up to the
          roof where he learned that Holly was missing and had been held back
          by Gruber and taken prisoner on the 30th floor. To save the other hostages,
          McClane fired a machine gun into the air and ordered them to flee downstairs
          back to the 30th floor to escape the wired-to-blow roof. He then jumped
		   from the rooftop to escape the high-rise's explosion, while attached
		   to a firehose tied around his waist. Gruber detonated the roof and
		   destroyed one of the FBI helicopters in the process. In the basement, Theo's
          escape scheme in an emergency ambulance getaway vehicle was thwarted.
          During a final tense face-to-face showdown, Gruber was holding McClane's
          estranged wife Holly hostage. McClane distracted Gruber with nervous
          laughter and suddenly reached behind his back  (to get  his 
          concealed loaded gun taped to his back with his last two bullets).
          Gruber was wounded in the shoulder, and the bullet also broke the window
          behind him. As Gruber stumbled backwards through the broken
          window pane, he grabbed for Holly's arm and metal Rolex wristwatch-band,
          nearly dragging her with him. McClane rushed forward
          and grabbed her, released or unclapsed the band, and watched as Gruber
          unforgettably fell backwards to his death 30 stories below. Now that
          the crisis was over, the bloodied and exhausted, McClane joyously kissed
          Holly. They emerged in front of the building as the final terrorist
          Karl, thought to be dead,  appeared screaming and aiming a machine
          gun at McClane to ambush him, but he was killed by LAPD Sgt. Al Powell
          (Reginald VelJohnson). The film concluded with McClane's limo driver
          Argyle preparing to drive the reunited couple away from the chaos,
          as they kissed in the limo's back seat. </font></p>        </td>

            lust, greed, revenge, and seafood,&quot; in which three eccentric
            thieves (Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, and Michael Palin) battled
            the authorities and each other to recover a valuable cache of stolen
            diamonds. All actors were perfect in their roles, especially the
            self-absorbed, not-too-bright (&quot;Don't you ever call me stupid&quot;)
            Buddha-misquoting Anglophobe Otto West (Kevin Kline) and the stuttering,
            animal-loving hitman Ken (Michael Palin). It featured such bits as
            Ken's attempts to murder an old woman that resulted in the deaths
            of her dogs (to his horror), Otto's constant tormenting of Ken (&quot;Look!
            It's K-k-ken coming to k-k-kill me!&quot;) and conservative, uptight
            barrister Archie Leach (John Cleese), and Wanda Gerschwitz's (Jamie
            Lee Curtis) use of sex to dominate the men in her life and her total
            arousal to foreign languages like Italian and Russian. The leads
            would team up again in the comedy <em>Fierce Creatures (1997)</em>,
            in lieu of a sequel.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Rain Man (1988), </b>134 minutes, D: Barry Levinson<br />
            Director Barry Levinson's Best Picture-winning drama and bittersweet
                character study was essentially a comedy road film. Mid-twenties,
                boastful yuppie California car dealer Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise),
                a fast-talking, slick and ambitious hustler, was in the business
                of importing expensive sports cars to Los Angeles buyers. His
                uncaring and insensitive nature was illustrated in his interactions
                with his pretty Italian secretary/fiancee Susanna (Valeria
                Golino). When he learned of his estranged wealthy father Sanford
                Babbitt's death, Susanna was appalled that he was emotionless
                when he first heard the news and at the Cincinnati, OH funeral.
                At the reading of the will, Charlie interpreted his father's
                paltry gift to him of a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible and
                some prize-winning rose bushes as a personal insult. The remainder
                of the $3 million estate was entered into a trust fund for another
                secret beneficiary. During a crucial sequence, Charlie explained
                to Susanna how he was soothed as a younger child (his mother
                died when Charlie was very young) by an imaginary friend: (&quot;When
                I was a kid and I got scared, the Rain Man would come and sing
                to me....You know, one of those imaginary childhood friends&quot;).
                Charlie traced the beneficiary to Wallbrook, an institution for
                the mentally disabled. He met one of the high-functioning, autistic-idiot
                savant patients (with an amazing memory and facility
                with numbers), named Raymond  (Oscar-winning
                Dustin Hoffman) and realized it was his own older sibling - they
                were brothers unknown to each other, forgotten
                and separated at infancy.  Raymond had been at the hospital since
                he was 18 years old (when Charlie was still a two and a half
                year-old toddler), and Raymond was the other beneficiary - Charlie
                was told: &quot;He doesn't understand the concept of money.&quot; The anxious, idiosyncratic,
                and self-absorbed Raymond had established many routines in his
                life, including watching TV programs <i>The
                People's Court</i> and <i>Jeopardy</i>, and he often recited
                <a href="whosonfirst.html"><i>&quot;Who's On First?&quot;</i></a> (the
                famous Abbott and Costello dialogue) if agitated. When denied
                half of the inheritance, Charlie decided to kidnap his brother
                (and Susanna returned to LA on her own, due to her frustration
                with his manipulations). The two brothers were forced to head
                back to California in the Buick (due to Raymond's fear of flying)
                - on back roads. Raymond walked with a stiff gait, cocked head, a reliance on routines,
                and endless chatter. Popular catchphrases were often quoted in
                his dialogues, such as: &quot;Kmart
                sucks,&quot; &quot;I'm an excellent driver,&quot; and &quot;Ten minutes to Wapner.&quot; The
            shallow, selfish, greedy and exasperated Charlie attempted to
            separate Raymond from the lion's-share of the money, but the memorable
                six-day cross-country car trip also brought about self-discovery,
                values reassessment and reconciliation. Their relationship and
                bond intensified and grew touching as they developed a caring
                and connected understanding for each other, and Charlie's initial
                plan to wheel-and-deal his brother to give up the fortune had
                a change of heart. In particular, after Raymond muttered &quot;Funny
                Rainman,&quot; Charlie realized that his childhood imaginary
                friend (&quot;Rainman&quot;) was actually his brother who comforted him
                as an infant by singing the Beatles' &quot;I Saw Her Standing There.&quot;
                He also learned the reason for Raymond's institutionalization
                - he was sent away for nearly scalding young Charlie to death:
                 (&quot;Hot water burn baby&quot;). During their journey, they took at entertaining
                detour to Las Vegas, where Raymond became an expert at counting
                cards to win at gambling. Susanna unexpectedly showed up to join
                them, and she danced with Raymond in an elevator and gave him
                his first kiss. Once they arrived in Los Angeles, the long-term
                custody of Raymond with Charlie was discussed.  Charlie was offered
                a check for $250,000 to &quot;just walk
            away&quot; and allow Raymond to return to the institution. Charlie refused the
          check - he claimed that his priorities had changed (&quot;It's not
          about the money anymore&quot;) and he wanted to take care of his brother
          by himself. Ultimately, Charlie realized
          that Raymond needed round-the-clock institutional care. In
              their tear-jerking emotional farewell scene at a train station
          where they parted, the two brothers, now bonded, had touched heads
          together.</font></p>          </td>

              Errol Morris<br />
              This engrossing documentary expose about a gross miscarriage of
              justice from writer/director film-maker Errol Morris had the intriguing
              tagline: &quot;A softcore movie, Dr. Death, a chocolate milkshake,
              a nosey blonde and 'The Carol Burnett Show.' Solving this mystery
              is going to be murder.&quot; [Note: Morris' original intention
              was to make a documentary about notorious Dallas forensics psychiatrist
              James Grigson, who had earned the nickname 'Dr. Death' for the
              number of times his expert testimony had been instrumental in sending
              defendants to the electric chair.] The crime scene and investigation
              of a police officer's murder in Dallas, Texas in late November
              of 1976, was re-enacted in the film. The crime occurred during
              the Thanksgiving Day weekend in 1976, after 28 year-old drifter
              Randall Dale Adams (Himself and Adam Goldfine) ran out of gas on
              the highway. He hitched a ride with 16 year-old teenager David
              Ray Harris (Himself and Derek Horton) driving a stolen blue compact
              car (and also having stolen his father's .22 caliber revolver and
              shotgun). A few hours later (after drinking, smoking pot, and watching
              two soft-core porno films at a local drive-in), their car was routinely
              stopped (for not having proper lights) shortly after midnight by
              Dallas police officers Robert Wood (Ron Thornhill) and Teresa Turko
              (Marianne Leone). Wood was killed with five shots as he approached
              the car - it was unclear who had pulled the trigger. Turko (who
              had cast aside a chocolate milkshake) couldn't confirm conclusively
              the type of car or its driver. Police were alerted to Harris after
              he had returned to his small Texas hometown of Vidor, where he
              bragged about killing &quot;the f--king pig.&quot; When police
              questioned him, he perjured himself and pinned the killing on Randall.
              About a month after the crime, Adams was arrested and questioned
              (without a lawyer present), all the while protesting his innocence.
              He was forced to sign a false confession that he was in the car
              with Harris, but didn't know what had happened. Assistant District
              Attorney Doug Mulder charged Adams with the murder, and pushed
              for the death penalty. Harris escaped with any charges because
              he was an underage juvenile and couldn't be sentenced to death.
              Adams was defended by defense attorneys Edith James (Herself) and
              Dennis White (Himself), while the judge presiding over the case
          was Donald J. Metcalfe (Himself). During the
          murder trial, Harris claimed it was Adams who (1) was driving, and
          (2) shot and killed the officer with the stolen gun under the seat.
          Harris said he was crouched down in the passenger seat. Other misleading
          eyewitnesses claimed that Adams was the killer, but Mulder was able
          to keep their testimony a secret so that they couldn't be cross-examined.
          Adams calmly contradicted Harris' account. He said he had been dropped
          off at his motel room at about 9:30 pm, a few hours before the crime,
              and that he had watched <i>The Carol Burnett Show</i> on TV before
              going to sleep. Nonetheless, Adams was convicted and sentenced
              to death in 1977, but his sentence was later commuted to life in
              prison. As a result of the film, convicted murderer Adams, who
          had been wrongly imprisoned for twelve years, was finally set free.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Robert Zemeckis<br />
            Director Robert Zemeckis' technically-marvelous film blending animated,
            ink-and-paint cartoon characters and flesh-and-blood live actors,
            was a convincing comedy/mystery noir thriller set in Los Angeles
            in 1947. It was very loosely based on Gary Wolf's 1981 novel <em>Who
            Censored Roger Rabbit?</em> (with comic-book and newspaper 
			strip characters who spoke with word balloons
            instead of voices) -- in a very sanitized version. Earlier efforts
            to combine humans and ink-and-paint cartoon characters side-by-side
            in a film (Disney's S<em>ong of the South (1946)</em> and <em>Mary
            Poppins (1964)</em>, for example) were considered primitive next
            to this film, which used computers to precisely repeat camera movements
            and calculate shading, to allow them to cast shadows and have complex
            lighting. Unprecedented cooperation from Warner Brothers and Disney
            allowed for classic cartoon characters to be seen together for the
            first time, such as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny parachuting together,
            having both Tinkerbell and Porky Pig end the movie, and, of course,
            the famous piano duel between Daffy and Donald Duck in a Cotton Club-style
            nightclub, the Ink &amp; Paint Club. The film was a
            delightful spoof of the hard-boiled Sam Spade films and reminiscent
            of <a href="chin.html"><em>Chinatown (1974)</em></a>, complete with
            a sultry, <em>femme fatale</em> humanoid Toon named Jessica Rabbit
            (Kathleen Turner, uncredited, with singing voice by Amy Irving, Amblin
            Entertainment executive producer Steven Spielberg's wife at the time),
            and a case involving alleged marital infidelity (&quot;pattycake&quot;),
            murder, a missing will, blackmail, and a conspiracy hatched by evil,
            Toon-hating Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) (of Cloverleaf Industries).
            Doom's plan was to bring freeways to LA, thereby ruining the existing
            Pacific &amp; Electric Red Car public transport electric trolley
            system. The film revolved around the murder of Marvin Acme (Stubby
            Kaye), a gag-gift promoter and props supplier (Acme Novelty Co.)
            for all Toon productions and the owner of the ghetto-ized Toon-town
            where the Toons, regarded as a segregated minority group, lived just
            outside Hollywood. Framed for the murder, zany Maroon Cartoon Studios
            actor Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer), a stuttering, disaster-prone
            'Toon,' solicited help from reluctant, hard-boiled, boozing private
            eye Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to clear his name. Valiant was still
            grief-stricken over the death of brother Ted by a falling cartoon
            piano, but was financially - and emotionally - supported by girlfriend
        Dolores (Joanna Cassidy), as he solved the case. </font></p></td>
