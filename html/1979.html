              minutes, D: Ridley Scott<br />
            Director Ridley Scott's grisly, futuristic, suspenseful, atmospheric,
            memorable and popular science fiction/horror film featured terrific
            sets designed by surreal artist H. R. Giger. It was followed by three
            sequels, including James Cameron's <em><a href="series-alien2.html">Aliens
            (1986)</a></em>, <em><a href="series-alien3.html">Alien3 (1992)</a></em>,
            and <em><a href="series-alien4.html">Alien Resurrection (1997)</a></em>.
            Its plot was about the intergalactic journey
            of a claustrophobic, commercial space cargo freighter, the <em>Nostromo. </em>After
            its mission to collect 20 million tons of mineral ore, it was on
            its return to Earth, when the crew was awakened by the main computer
            (dubbed &quot;Mother&quot;). The crew included
            second-in-command warrant officer heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver
            in her starring debut role), Kane (John Hurt), leader Dallas (Tom
            Skerritt), Ash (Ian Holm), and others, who were awakened from hyper-sleep
            to investigate a distress radio signal on a mysteriously bleak, uncharted
            dead planet with a crashed alien spacecraft. Three of the seven crew
            donned space suits and took a shuttle vehicle to investigate. In
            the interior of the massive downed spaceship, they found large egg-shaped
            pods. One of the quivering, fleshy lifeforms (with tentacles) burst
            forth from one egg-pod, pierced through Kane's helmet, and attached
            itself to his face. Although he appeared asphyxiated, he was somehow
            supplied with oxygen. Back on board the <i>Nostromo</i>, over Ripley's
            objections about quarantining them, the parasitic lifeform presumably
            incubated inside Kane (as the host body), and then ultimately burst
            from his gut as a miniature toothy lizard during the film's most
            memorable 'birthing' sequence.  The hideous, indestructible, carnivorous
            alien creature grew in size, metamorphisized, oozed yellow acidic
            bile if cut into, and hid within the hyper-tech spacecraft - all
            the while menacing, hunting, and picking off one crew member after
            another. Eventually, it was revealed that Ash was an android, and
            that the crew's true mission all along was to bring back the indestructible
            lifeform to Earth. In the film's explosive conclusion, tall, self-reliant,
            resourceful Ripley  (in only a skimpy T-shirt and panties) outsmarted
            the primal,  lethal monster, and expelled it from the shuttle vehicle
            into space. </font></p>

            119 minutes, D: Norman Jewison<br />
        This blockbuster hit was a satirical, outrageous,
            lampooning take on the criminal justice system. Idealistic, hot-headed
            criminal defense attorney Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino) in Baltimore,
            MD was called upon to defend by-the-book Judge Henry T. Fleming
            (John Forsythe), his arch nemesis. Earlier, the Judge had wrongly
            sentenced and imprisoned Kirkland's criminally-convicted client
            Jeff McCullaugh (Thomas G. Waites) because of a technicality (Kirkland
            had filed a motion to reopen the case three days late). Kirkland
            was also jailed on contempt charges. At the same time, Kirkland
            was facing the bar's disciplinary committee on ethics charges,
            while sleeping with Gale Packer (Christine Lahti), a member of
            the committee. And other problems were occurring: Kirkland's law
            partner Jay Porter (Jeffrey Tambor) was experiencing a nervous
            breakdown over some bad judicial decisions, while another of Kirkland's
            clients - transgendered Ralph Agee (Robert Christian) - committed
            suicide by hanging after the mishandling of his case. Kirkland
            was shocked to be forced to represent the Judge when the venerable
            man was charged with brutal assault and rape charges. (The Judge
            used blackmail to coerce Kirkland to defend him, by threatening
            to disclose a serious ethics violation years earlier - a violation
            of lawyer-client confidentiality. The Judge also promised to reopen
            the McCullaugh case if Kirkland accepted the case.) During the
            lengthy proceedings before trial, McCullaugh was repeatedly raped
            in prison, and eventually retaliated by grabbing a gun and taking
            two hostages - before he was killed by snipers. The Judge's case
            was presided over by Judge Francis Rayford (Jack Warden), while
            the prosecuting attorney was Frank Bowers (Craig T. Nelson). In
            private, the Judge (after being presented with photographs showing
            him engaged in S&amp;M with a prostitute), admitted to Kirkland that he was guilty. However,
            he was able to pass a polygraph test. Incensed by his client's
            callous attitude (the Judge had casually said he would like to
            see the &quot;attractive&quot; rape victim again, and he had paid
            a witness to testify in his favor), it appeared that Kirkland was
            properly defending his client with his opening statement, but then
            turned on him with tremendous rage, condemning him for abusing
            law and order and calling the loathsome judge guilty:
            &quot;My client, the Honorable Henry T. Fleming, should go right
            to f--kin' jail! The son of a bitch is guilty! That man is guilty!
            That man there, that man is a slime! He is a slime! If he's allowed
            to go free, then something really wrong is goin' on here!...&quot; When
            Judge Rayford ruled that Kirkland was out of order, he retorted: &quot;You're
            out of order! You're out of order! The whole trial is out of order!
            They're out of order! That man, that sick, crazy depraved man raped
            and beat that woman there, and he'd like to do it again! He told
            me so!&quot; In the final scene, Kirkland was sitting on the courthouse
        steps, wondering about his career's future. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Francis Ford Coppola<br />
          Director Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping,
            surreal, still-controversial Vietnam war epic has been considered
          by many to be the best war movie of all time, with incredible performances.
            A revised version, <em>Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)</em> followed.
            It was a masterful, thought-provoking, pretentious
            film, with beautifully-chaotic visuals, about the nightmarish, moral
            madness of the Vietnam War, inspired by the novella <em>Heart of
              Darkness</em> by Joseph Conrad.  The grueling production in
            the Philippines led to vast budget overruns and physical and emotional
        breakdowns. In the story beginning in Saigon in 1969, a debauched US
              Army vet Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen) was awaiting
              orders for a top-secret mission in a hotel room. He learned he
              would be sent up the Nung River into the off-limits Cambodian jungle
          aboard a Navy patrol boat carrying a young, spaced-out crew. His
          military objective was to assassinate (&quot;terminate...with extreme
          prejudice&quot;) a Buddha-like, renegade Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon
          Brando), once a decorated Special Forces officer, who had become an
          insane demi-god and now ran his own jungle fiefdom, and lorded himself
          over the native peoples and Montagnard troops. His patrol boat companions
          included African-American boat commander &quot;Chief&quot; Phillips
          (Albert Hall), New Orleans cook &quot;Chef&quot; (Frederic Forrest), 
		  17 year-old Bronx ghetto youth &quot;Mr.
            Clean&quot; (Larry Fishburne), and California surfer-water skiier
            Lance (Sam Bottoms).  During the river journey, the crew met
            up with hawkish, reckless and 
            gung-ho  Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall) wearing
            a black Stetson hat. The surf-loving, flamboyant and fearless Lieutenant Kilgore gave a famous
            speech amidst blowing yellow smoke while others surfed in celebration: &quot;I
            love the smell of napalm in the morning... smelled like... victory,&quot; (and &quot;Charlie
            don't surf&quot;). A devastating dawn naval attack by his 9th Air Cavalry unit was choreographed
            (supplemented with visual/audio components) with the use of napalm
            on a Vietnamese village (with suspected Viet Cong) by swooping and
            swarming Huey helicopters, to the tune of Wagner's &quot;The Ride
            of the Valkyries&quot; blaring over loudspeakers. Afterwards, the group arrived at an
            isolated US base supply depot at Hau Phat in a surreal nighttime
            scene brilliantly lit by floodlights; Playboy Bunnies performed in
            a USO-styled show for sex-starved soldiers. There
            were further sequences involving the unnecessary machine-gunning
               massacre of a civilian sampan (with innocent peasants) by the
              panicky crew, and  a bizarre night battle for the
            besieged, psychedically-lit, temporary Do Lung bridge. At
            Kurtz' strange jungle compound and outpost inside Cambodia (with
            severed heads and hanging mutilated bodies in view), Willard first
            encountered maniacal, fast-talking US freelance photographer (Dennis
            Hopper), and then was ushered into Kurtz' presence inside a dark
            temple. In the shadowy confrontation between Willard and an incoherently-mumbling
            and deranged, overweight and bald Kurtz (weighing hundreds of pounds
            with head shaven), the Colonel spoke about the 'horrors' 
			he had experienced: &quot;I've seen the horrors,
            horrors that you've seen. But you have no right to call me a murderer.
            You have a right to kill me - you have a right to do that - but
            you have no right to judge me.&quot; Although
            Kurtz encouraged Willard to disobey and challenge his officers, he
            also urged his own death. Ultimately, Willard
            emerged from the jungle water and carried out his mission of murder
            with a machete - interspliced with the natives' ritualistic slaughter
            of a water buffalo (outraging animal activists). Willard and the
            catatonic and crazed Lance (the only surviving patrol boat member)
            departed from the site, hearing Kurtz' last words about wartime atrocities: &quot;The
            horror, the horror.&quot; In some versions of the film (during the end credits), a fiery, large-scale
        aerial attack was staged to destroy Kurtz' jungle fortress.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Hal Ashby<br />
            Subtitled &quot;A story of chance,&quot; this provocative black comedy
            was a wonderful tale that satirized politics, celebrity, media-obsession
          and television, and extolled the wisdom of innocence. The
          film was directed by director Hal Ashby (already known for <em>Harold
          and Maude (1971)</em>, <em>The Last Detail (1973)</em>,<em> Shampoo
          (1975)</em>,<em> Bound for Glory (1976),</em> and the acclaimed Vietnam
          war film <em>Coming Home (1978)</em>). The politically-satirical, overly-long
          film about mistaken identity and the television age was adapted from
          a 1971 novel by Jerzy Kosinski, with Peter Sellers in a chameleon-like
          role (a fool-turned-prophet transformation) in his second-to-last film.
          His role was the forerunner to the mentally-challenged Tom Hanks character
          in <i>Forrest Gump (1994).</i> The subtle film's slogan proclaimed: &quot;Getting there is half the fun.
          Being there is all of it.&quot; It told a placid fable about Chance
          the Gardener or Chauncey Gardiner (Peter Sellers), a reclusive, emotionless,
          illiterate, passive, and simple-minded gardener who was well-groomed,
          fed on schedule, and dressed in custom-tailored suits. He had lived
          his whole sheltered life within the walled, Washington, DC estate of
            an eccentric millionaire named Jennings. His only knowledge of the &quot;real&quot; outside
            world, an encroaching inner-city ghetto area, was through watching
          television. After his employer died, he wandered
          out into the street in a daze with his TV's remote-control to aid him.
            When his leg was injured in an accidental mishap, and his name was
            thought to be &quot;Chauncey Gardiner,&quot; he was befriended by 
			Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine), the wife of dying billionaire
          industrialist Benjamin Rand (Melvin Douglas).  Chauncey's black maid-cook
            Louise (Ruth Attaway) cynically and contemptuously knew the truth
            about the retarded Chance/Chauncey Gardiner and the false accolades
            he would eventually receive: (&quot;And I'll say right now, he never
            learned to read and write. No, sir. Had no brains at all. Was stuffed
            with rice pudding between the ears. Shortchanged by the Lord, and
            dumb as a jack-ass. Look at him now!&quot;). Quiet and unassuming
            simpleton Chauncey even caught the attention of none other than President
            'Bobby' (Jack Warden). His simple statements about gardening were mis-interpreted as profound
            and wise political-economic advice: (&quot;As long as the roots are not
            severed, all is well, and all will be well in the garden....In a
            garden, growth has its season. First comes spring and summer, but
            then we have fall and winter. And then we get spring and summer again....There
            will be growth in the spring&quot;). His new-found popularity
            led to talk-show appearances, insider parties, book publisher advances,
            and the potential to become a presidential candidate.  
          The film's ending took place during the memorial funeral of sickly
          businessman-financier Benjamin Turnbull Rand, while one of the pallbearers
          discussed the protagonist's bid for the Presidency: &quot;I do believe,
          gentlemen, if we want to hold on to the Presidency, our one and only
          chance is Chauncey Gardiner.&quot; In the mystical, incongruous conclusion
          (accompanied by off/on-screen voices), the totally innocent idiot Chance-Chauncey
            Gardiner, who had wandered away from the ceremony into a wooded area
            closeby, blithely stepped onto a pond and literally walked on the
            water. He tested the depth of the water with the length of his umbrella
          - and then continued walking away from the camera. The
          final words of the film were delivered by the President at the funeral,
          and were heard from a distance: &quot;Life is a state of mind.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

              Robert Benton<br />
          Robert Benton's sensitive, tear-jerking Best Picture-winning
              marital drama was about a dysfunctional yuppie family. Ted Kramer
              (Dustin Hoffman), a workaholic NYC ad executive, suffered an abrupt
              break-up with unfulfilled, bored and depressed wife Joanna (Meryl
              Streep). The emotionally-unstable Joanna walked out on him, stating
              that she was unhappy and needed to find herself. Suddenly, he was
              propelled into the uncomfortable paternal role of single dad with
              young 6 year-old son Billy (Justin Henry), needing to take on a
              nurturing gender role, and balancing demanding career obligations
              with parenthood (which ultimately meant that Ted was fired from
              his demanding ad job, but found other less profitable work). However,
              he was able to establish a very close bond with Billy. But then,
              about 15 months later, estranged ex-wife Joanna unexpectedly returned
              to take their son away with her, setting up a nasty child-custody
              battle in the court. The presiding judge was Judge Atkins (Howland
          Chamberlain). During her testimony, Joanna argued
              that she had now regained her self-esteem, was earning a decent
              salary, and had taken a steady lover. Ted's friend, neighbor and
              soul-mate Margaret (Jane Alexander) testified that Ted made a great
              father, although she admitted that she had counseled Joanna to
              leave if she was unhappy. Ted made an eloquent and heart-felt court
              plea - defending his right to have custody of his son over Joanna,
              and his admission that he was not a perfect parent: &quot;My wife,
              my ex-wife, says that she loves Billy, and I believe she does,
              but I don't think that's the issue here. If I understand it correctly,
              what means the most here is what's best for our son. What's best
              for Billy...Billy has a home with me. I've made it the best I could.
              It's not perfect. I'm not a perfect parent. Sometimes I don't have
              enough patience because I forget that he's a little kid. But I'm
              there. We get up in the morning and then we eat breakfast, and
              he talks to me and then we go to school. And at night, we have
              dinner together and we talk then and I read to him. And, and we
              built a life together and we love each other. If you destroy that,
              it may be irreparable. Joanna, don't do that, please. Don't do
              it twice to him.&quot; However, the Judge ruled in favor of mother
              Joanna - Ted lost custody, had to pay child support, and was granted
              limited visitation rights. In the film's unexpected concluding
              scene, Joanna met with the persevering Ted after winning custody
              and was about to take Billy away. But then, she backed down with
              a sudden change of heart when she realized father-and-son's close
              bond. She decided that Billy should remain with him in his true
          home.</font></p>          </td>

              and Mary's personality but then became attracted and fascinated
              by her and began his own affair with her. In a heartbreaking soda
              fountain scene, he confessed his affair to a tearful Tracy and
              urged a break-up by encouraging her to study acting in London,
              but later regretted his foolhardly decision after his dalliance
              with Mary soon fell apart when she returned to Yale. The film concluded
              with Isaac's hopeful and more optimistic musings (into a tape recorder)
              about what made &quot;life worth living.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

              Die Ehe Der Maria Braun)</b>, 120 minutes, D: Rainer Werner Fassbinder<br />
          New German cinema's auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder found further recognition
          with this influential melodrama - a parable about survival in post-war
          Germany. Hanna Schygulla starred as the shrewd and ambitious title
          character, a symbol of the entire nation, who thrived as a career woman
          at the same time that the country emerged into a period of corruption
          and decadent prosperity. The resourceful, adaptive and opportunistic
          Maria used her sexuality and beauty to achieve success with a string
          of men, resulting in a get-rich-quick rise to capitalistic power -
          at a terrible personal price. This intelligent and challenging film
          was the first of a so-called BRD trilogy, followed by <i>Lola (1981)</i> and <i>Veronika Voss (1982)</i>. </font></p></td>

              Frawley
        </font><br />
          <font size="2">Director James Frawley's great children's film, a comedy-musical-fantasy
          and road movie hybrid, was the first in a series of full-length, feature-film
          <i>Muppet</i> movies, marking a smooth transition, first on <i>Sesame
          Street</i> (1969-present), and then on Jim
          Henson's syndicated TV show <i>The Muppet Show (1976-1981)</i>,
          and finally on the big screen. Other movies in the franchise included
          <i>The Great Muppet Caper (1981), The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984),
          The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), Muppet Treasure Island (1996), Muppets
          from Space (1999), The Muppets (2011), </i>and<i> Muppets Most Wanted
          (2014). </i> The entertaining film was deliberately filled with cheesy
          puns, sight gags, one-liners and jokes (i.e. turning left at the literal
          fork in the road), numerous celebrity cameos (from Hollywood's Golden
          Age through to hip comedians and actors of the time), and astonishing
          puppetry tricks. The film began with a rowdy group of Muppets in a
          Hollywood studio's screening room for a private viewing to watch a
          film-within-a film - the rags-to-riches origins of Kermit the Frog
          (voice of Jim Henson) in a Georgia swamp, with the image of him strumming
          a banjo and singing the Oscar-nominated &quot;The
          Rainbow Connection.&quot; The film's plot followed
          Kermit after he was approached by vacationing Hollywood talent scout
          Bernie (Dom Deluise) in a rowboat, and handed  a <i>Daily Variety</i> advertisement
          encouraging him to come to Hollywood and find success in professional
          show business (&quot;All frogs wishing to become rich and famous&quot;).
          Kermit decided to embark on a cross-country trip to Hollywood, California,
          encountering other bizarre Muppets who joined him along the way. Additional
          Muppets included unfunny, clownish song-and-dance Fozzie the Bear (voice
          of Frank Oz), silly, chicken-loving plumber Great Gonzo (voice of Dave
          Goelz), Gonzo's girlfriend Camille the Chicken (voice of Jerry Nelson),
          Dr. Teeth (also Henson) and the Electric Mayhem Band, pianist Rowlf
          the Dog (also Henson), and Kermit's future vain, preening and explosively
          violent sweetheart Miss Piggy (also Oz), with whom he experienced love-at-first-sight.
          During their journey in Fozzie's 1951 Studebaker, they were pursued
          by villainous restaurateur Doc Hopper (Charles Durning) (a greedy KFC
          Colonel Sanders) and his insane, German accented mad-scientist assistant
          Professor Max Krassman (Mel Brooks). Hopper was the owner of a French-fried
          frogs' legs fast-food franchise, who wanted Kermit to be employed for
          him as a spokesperson for his business chain. When Kermit refused (&quot;All
          I can see are millions of frogs on tiny crutches&quot;), he was abducted
          and a failed attempt was made to change Kermit's mind through electronic
          brainwashing. Ultimately, there came a western-styled showdown in a
          ghost town between cowboy-costumed Kermit and Hopper who threatened:
          (&quot;All right,
          Frog, one last chance. You're gonna do my TV commercial live or stuffed&quot;);
          Kermit replied: (&quot;Hopper,
            what's the matter with you? You gotta be crazy chasin' me half-way
            across the country. Why are you doing this to me?&quot;). When
            Doc Hopper expressed his desire to own a thousand frog-leg restaurants,
            Kermit replied: (&quot;I've got a dream too. But it's about singing
            and dancing and making people happy. That's the kind of dream
            that gets better the more people you share it with. And, well,
            I've found a whole bunch of friends who have the same dream.
            And, it kind of makes us like a family. You have anybody like
            that, Hopper? I men, once you get all those restaurants, who're
            you gonna share it with? Who are your friends, Doc? Those guys?
          I got lots of friends&quot;). In the <i>deus
          ex machina</i> ending, Animal (also Oz) grew to giant size after swallowing
          InstaGrow pills and scared off Doc Hopper. In Hollywood,   studio executive
          Lew Lord (Orson Welles) instructed  his secretary (Cloris Leachman): &quot;Miss
          Tracy, prepare the standard 'rich-and-famous' contract for Kermit the
          Frog and company.&quot; In the climax during
          script practice, Gonzo crashed into a prop rainbow, and an explosion
          blew a hole in the roof of the studio, causing a rainbow to shine through
          the studio set ceiling onto the cast; the entire Muppet group sang
          a reprise of &quot;The Rainbow Connection&quot; (&quot;Life's like
          a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending, we
          did what we set out to do...&quot;) - interrupted when Sweetums (voice
          of Richard Hunt) burst through the film's screen into the theater where
          the rest of the Muppet cast was watching the film: (&quot;I just KNEW
          I'd catch up to you guys!&quot;). There were
          additional end credits antics of the Muppets, concluding with Animal
          bursting through the &quot;THE END&quot; screen and
          telling the audience: &quot;Go home! Go home! Bye-bye!&quot;</font></p>          </td>

                (Klaus Kinski). The vampire's first attempt to take pure and
                virginal Lucy Harker (Isabelle Adjani) failed when she refused
                his entreaties. Later, however, she sacrificially offered herself
                up to the vampire - a ploy to vanquish Dracula's evil. With a
                pale face and wearing a white gown, she was lying perfectly still
                and awaiting his 'kiss.' As he groped her breast with his long
                fingered-hand, he slowly descended to bite her neck and feed
                upon her blood. Her lethal strategy to keep him there paid off

            minutes, D: Harold Becker</font><br />
            <font size="2">This crime drama was about
              the prolonged miscarriage of justice. It was based on a true series
              of incidents, recounted in LAPD Sergeant Joseph Wambaugh's 1973 book.
              It told about the 1963 kidnapping of two plainclothes officers in
              an unmarked car in Hollywood by two known criminals, ending in the
              death of Officer Ian James Campbell (in an 'onion field' near Bakersfield,
              CA). The film followed the events of the true-case and the book fairly
              faithfully -- two LA detectives (both married): inexperienced Karl
              Hettinger (John Savage) and veteran cop Ian Campbell (Ted Danson
              in his debut film) were kidnapped by criminals Greg Powell (James
              Woods) and Jimmy Smith (aka &quot;Jimmy Youngblood&quot;) (Franklyn
              Seales) in Hollywood. They were driven to an onion field near Bakersfield,
              where Campbell was shot and killed (after being shot initially,
              he was also shot 4 times in the chest while on the ground), while
              Hettinger managed to escape into the darkness. After Powell was
              apprehended by police and interrogated by Sgt. Pierce Brooks (Ronny
              Cox), he blamed partner Smith for the murder. Smith was arrested,
              who then blamed Powell for the crime. Both were charged with first-degree
              murder. Due to the physical and emotional
                stress of the case, and the multiple times that he had to defend
                his actions (and face criticism and tormenting guilt for Campbell's
                death) and relive the past, Officer Hettinger suffered depression
                and a nervous breakdown and was forced to resign. His symptoms
                included suicidal thoughts, impotence, petty shoplifting, weight
                loss, and nightmares - he eventually recovered. Meanwhile, the
                two suspects were tried together, convicted by Hettinger's eye-witness
                testimony, and sentenced to death row. However, the California
                Supreme Court reversed the conviction, arguing, in part, that the
                two should have been tried separately. Powell became adept at appeals
                and exploiting the legal system by delays, constant motions, petitions,
                and objections, and the two evaded prosecution for years. The two
                faced a retrial (separately) in 1969. Ultimately, the sentence
                for both was reduced to life imprisonment when capital punishment
        was abolished in California. </font></p></td>

                Director Volker Schlondorff's bizarre, visually-compelling drama
                was based on one half of Gunter Grass's highly acclaimed 1959
                novel, and became a Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award
                winner. This dark, nightmarish fairy-tale film was about war's
                madness as the Nazis came to power in the 1920s, told through
                the eyes of young Oskar Matzerath (David Bennent). He was blessed
                with auditory clairvoyance and lived in the &quot;free city&quot; of
                Danzig on the Polish-German border. At the age of 3, he received
                a tin drum for his birthday - and then after an accident, willed
                himself to not grow any further. He released his anger by pounding
                on his drum and letting go a piercing scream (powerful enough
                to shatter glass) to drown out the horrors, both with greater
          frequency as Danzig was affected by war and Nazi occupation.        </font></p></td>
