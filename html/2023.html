      <p><font size="2"><b>Air (2023)</b>, 111 minutes, D: Ben Affleck<br />
        Director Ben Affleck's sports-themed biographical drama told the true
            backstory of the best-selling Air Jordan basketball shoes sold by
            Nike. It was based on a script  by first-timer Alex
            Convery. The Oregon-based company Nike was struggling in the mid-1980s,
            when Chairman and Marketing VP Rob Strasser (Jason Bateman) and company
            co-founder and CEO Phil Knight (Ben Affleck) commissioned Nike employee,
            shoe salesman and basketball talent scout Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon)
            to attempt to entice third-pick rookie BB player Michael Jordan (Damian
            Young) to switch his allegiance from Adidas and Converse to Nike.
            The company was willing to offer Jordan $250,000 (the entire BB division's
            budget) to brand-name a new shoe after Jordan, known as &quot;Air
            Jordan&quot; - using Air Sole technology. With the Jordan family
            matriarch Deloris Jordan (Viola Davis) offering advice (&quot;A shoe is
            just a shoe until my son steps into it&quot;), Michael fielded competitive
            offers, but chose Nike after they offered him a bonus - a percentage
            of every Air Jordan sold, a revolutionary concept. An epilogue revealed
            that the Air Jordan earned $162 million in one year, and transformed
            Nike into multi-national corporate giant. </font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>American Fiction (2023), </b>117 minutes, D: Cord
          Jefferson<br />
      Director Cord Jefferson's directorial feature debut film (with a win for
      his Best Adapted Screenplay) was loosely based on Percival Everett's 2001
      novel <i>Erasure</i>.
      It told about acclaimed but frustrated black writer and professor Thelonious &quot;Monk&quot; Ellison
          (Jeffrey Wright) living in Los Angeles. His academic writings were
          not best-sellers, due possibly (acc. to his publisher) for being &quot;not
          black enough&quot; and for not pandering to sensational and offensive
          depictions of the black experience. The publishing world would much
          rather publish the work of up-and-coming author Sintara Golden (Issa
          Rae), such as her gritty novel <i>We Lives in Da Ghetto</i>. Out
        of spite and due to his need for funds for the care of his elder mother
        Agnes (Leslie Uggams) in Boston, the embittered and drunken Ellison wrote
          a satirical manuscript titled <i>My Pafology</i> -
        using the alias name Stagg R. Leigh. The book was guaranteed to sell,
        due to its depictions of drug dealing and urban crime in the black community.
          His surprisingly successful book (later retitled
        &quot;F--K&quot;) exposed the pressures of the 'mostly white' publishing
        world on black writers, when &quot;Stagg&quot; (Ellison) was forced to
        take the persona of the author and hide his identity by posing as a violent
        and convicted felon (a fugitive from justice).
          &quot;Stagg&quot; was even offered a film adaptation by Hollywood producer
          Wiley (Adam Brody). The book was submitted for a Literary Award, and
          when &quot;Stagg&quot; received
          the grand prize trophy (its main competitor was Sintara's book) from
          votes by the white judges, he revealed his true identity - as he approached
          the stage. The film's plot twist was that everything seen in the film
          up to this point was Monk's screenplay, and he was discussing possible
          endings to his screenplay with Wiley. The drama concluded with possible
          alternate endings to the script, including the outrageous yet crowd-pleasing
          conclusion in which Monk was shot to death on stage by police officers
          at the awards ceremony.</font></p>      </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Anatomy of a Fall (2023, Fr.)</b>, 151 minutes, D: Justine
      Triet<br />
      French co-writer/director Justine Triet's tense who-dun-it crime drama
      and arthouse film, with an Oscar-win for Best Original Screenplay, and
      also part murder-mystery and thriller that concluded with a courtroom trial,
      was about the search for the truth surrounding a death that was never shown
      on-screen, except for its aftermath. In the beautifully-constructed plot,
      writer and stay-at-home French husband Samuel Maleski (Samuel Theis) with
      writer's block mysteriously fell from the top 3rd floor of his isolated
      chalet in Grenoble in the French Alps. He was found dead in the snow with
      bloody head injuries near the chalet by his visually-impaired 11 year-old
      son, Daniel Maleski (Milo Machado Graner), who was returning from a walk
      with his border collie guide-dog named Snoop. When he died, Samuel had
      been working on converting the chalet into an AirBnB to raise extra funds
      for the family. Was it a suicide, or murder, or an accident? German-born,
      France-based, bisexual German novelist Sandra Voyter (Sandra H&uuml;ller),
      Daniel's wife, was considered a possible suspect. The film presented many
      theories, conjectures, trauma reports, drawings, and personal testimonies
      to try and determine the cause. For instance, Samuel had allegedly attempted
      6 months earlier to overdose on aspirin. The investigation and outcome
      became more and more twisted and obfuscated, as new evidence emerged, and
      various details were uncovered. Sandra and Samuel were obviously a dysfunctional
      couple in a troubled and imperfect marriage - full of blame for each other
      - and often engaged in arguments. The depressed and resentful Sandra held
      Samuel accountable for Daniel's blindness due to his neglect, and he was
      upset with her for being overly-controlling, unfaithful and for plagiarizing
      some of his ideas for her own writings. When Sandra was accused of murder
      - curiously foretold by one of her own recent novels, she hired an old
      friend and lawyer named Vincent Renzi (Swann Arlaud) to defend her, knowing
      that he was in love with her. The prosecution contended that Sandra had
      struck her husband in the head before he plummeted to the ground. As the
      film concluded, young Daniel took the witness stand to either clear or
      convict his mother of the crime. His suspicions about his father's suicidal
      thoughts led to Sandra's acquittal. </font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Asteroid City (2023)</b>, 105 minutes, D: Wes Anderson <br />
      Writer/producer/director Wes Anderson's quirky, stylistic, whimsical, imaginative,
          and mind-bending comedy-drama with a large ensemble cast paid homage to sci-fi alien movies.
          It opened with a clever framing device - on the sparse set of
          a 1950s black-and-white TV show (framed in 4:3 Academy ratio), the
          on-screen fictional narrator/Host (Bryan Cranston) of
          an anthology TV series broke the fourth wall and spoke directly to
          the audience. He introduced the live theatrical play's legendary author-writer
          Conrad Earp (Edward Norton), who was typing out the play manuscript
          as it was rehearsed, produced and performed for the &quot;making-of&quot; TV
          documentary. The film's meta-narrative (with interspersed critical
          commentary upon itself) was described as being structured with title
          cards (for its three acts and epilogue). The screen widened and opened
          up to vibrantly-bleached pastel colors (a vivid bright blue sky and
          sandstone-colored landscape) during the opening credits (to the tune
          of &quot;Freight Train&quot;) in a mid-1950s American desert town (the fictional
          Asteroid City). The town's iconic main attraction was a gigantic crater
          created 3,000 years ago - evidence of the remains of an asteroid that
          crashed into the ground. Asteroid City was also the locale of frequent
          nuclear testing and bomb blasts. The story's plot began with the arrival into town of a widowed father
          named Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman), a war photographer and journalist,
          with his family of four children (three young daughters and his teenaged
          son Woodrow (Jake Ryan) nicknamed &quot;Brainiac&quot;). (Note: The family arrived
          without the mother - whose recent death had been concealed from the
          children by the grieving Augie.) Their disabled car was towed to a
          local Mechanic (Matt Dillon), where during repairs, the car exploded.
          Augie phoned father-in-law Stanley Zak (Tom Hanks) to come and help
          out. The purpose of the Steenbecks' visit was to attend the annual
          Junior Stargazing Convention, where astronomy enthusiasts and genius
          space camp cadets had come to gather - and Woodrow (and many other
          students) were to receive honors and awards for their futuristic inventions.
          The participants in the convention were housed in the local motel managed
          by a concierge (Steve Carell). Other prominent individuals who were
          in town included famous but melancholy actress Midge Campbell (Scarlett
          Johansson) with her teenaged daughter Dinah (Grace Edwards), both of
          whom developed love interests with Augie and Woodrow respectively.
          Further participants (students and parents) and Convention organizers-attendees
          included the Convention's host - 5-Star General Grif Gibson (Jeffrey
          Wright), local observatory astronomer Dr. Hickenlooper (Tilda Swinton),
          and three parents with their teenaged student honorees (J.J. Kellogg
          (Liev Schreiber) with son Clifford (Aristou Meehan), Roger Cho (Stephen
          Park) with son Ricky (Ethan Josh Lee), and Sandy Borden (Hope Davis)
          with daughter Shelly (Sophia Lillis)). In addition, a young teacher
          named June Douglas (Maya Hawke) was chaperoning a bus-load of elementary
          students, while distractedly falling in love with cowboy band singer
          Montana (Rupert Friend). The central event - the Convention - was suddenly
          interrupted by the unexpected arrival of a UFO that hovered above the crater. An alien
          (Jeff Goldblum) stole the asteroid from the town's crater, and as a
          result, the President ordered General Gibson to lock-down and quarantine
          the town with a military presence, and attempted to cover-up the incident,
          but the incursion (and the alien's existence) became known nationally
          after Ricky phoned to report everything to his school newspaper. When
          the alien UFO reappeared and reinstated the asteroid, the town's population
          revolted against their quarantine and overpowered the military. The
          convention attendees were provided with the opportunity to ask questions
          about the 'meaning of life' and to understand why the alien had returned
          to steal the meteorite - although there were no simple answers to life's
          mysteries. In a completely separate, behind-the-scenes story-telling
          string or strand, the play's creator Conrad Earp was having personal
          interactions with the actor playing Augie Steenbeck (Jones Hall), with
          recruited cast member Mercedes Ford who was playing the role of Midge
          Campbell, with the play's director Schubert Green (Adrien Brody), and
          with the would-be cast-mate who was to play Auggie's deceased wife
          (Margot Robbie), but had her scene cut from the play. In the film's
          epilogue set six months later, playwright Conrad Earp died in an automobile
          accident.</font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Barbie (2023),</b> 114 minutes, D: Greta Gerwig<br />
        This was the first live-action Barbie film, directed by Greta Gerwig
            who also co-scripted the screenplay with Noah Baumbach. The popular
            and creative blockbuster became the highest-grossing (domestic) film
            of the year 2023. After homage to  the 'Dawn of Man' sequence in
            <i><a href="twot.html">2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</a></i>, the
            fantasy-comedy opened in Barbie Land, a perfect, matriarchal, bubble-gum
            pink world in the 1950s where a very tall and perfect, mass-manufactured
            Barbie lived, described by the narrator (Helen Mirren): &quot;Since
            the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed,
            there have been dolls. But the dolls were always and forever baby
            dolls, until...&quot; Barbies ruled in Barbie Land, and 
			could be anything they wanted to be, including
            President (Issa Rae), physicist (Emma Mackey), or a Nobel Prize-winning
            writer (Alexandra Shipp). The male complements to Barbie were the
            handsome, sexless Ken dolls, who spent their days at the beach performing
            cheerleader moves. The main Stereotypical Barbie was portrayed by
            Margot Robbie, who explained: &quot;I'm Stereotypical
            Barbie. I'm like the Barbie you think of when someone says, 'Think
            of a Barbie.' That's me.&quot; She drove around in a pink convertible
            and spent her days having fun. But then during
            a dance party and after, she began to experience problems - blemished
            skin and cellulite, bad breath, a cold shower, a burnt waffle, flat
            feet, falling off a roof, and thoughts of mortality and death that
            haunted her: (&quot;Do you guys ever think about dying?&quot;). After
            consulting with Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), she learned that she
            had to venture into the Real World to correct the &quot;malfunction&quot; or
            unhappiness in the corresponding little girl who was playing with
            her. Her bleach-blonde dream guy, the original Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling)
            stowed away in her convertible to join the heroine for the adventurish
            ride into the flawed, male dominated world of Los Angeles: (&quot;Where
            you will don neon and Rollerblades, and enter the country of California&quot;).
            During their odyssey as life-sized versions of themselves, they were
            accidentally arrested several times, and Barbie was flabbergasted:
             (&quot;Everything is backwards here. Men look at me like I'm an
             object. Girls hate me. Everyone thinks I'm crazy, and I keep getting
             arrested&quot;). After Ken's discovery of the patriarchal world, Ken was pleasantly
            excited by his acceptance, and excitedly returned to Barbie Land.
             During Barbie's &quot;existential crisis,&quot; she met up with
             the unhappy human girl, tweenish Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), the
             daughter of Mattel company employee Gloria (America Ferrera). Sasha
             condemned Barbie for promoting unrealistic beauty values: &quot;You've
             been making women feel bad about themselves since you were invented....You
             represent everything wrong with our culture. Sexualized capitalism,
             unrealistic physical ideals...You set the feminist movement back
             50 years. You destroy girls' innate sense of worth and you are killing
        the planet with your glorification of rampant consumerism.&quot; It was
        a devastating blow to Barbie, and she ran off in tears. Meanwhile,
        Mattel's CEO (Will Ferrell) who had manufactured her, heard about Barbie's
        existence, and wished to capture her and deport her - and put her back
        in her life-sized sealed box and send her back to Barbie Land: (&quot;No
        one rests until this doll is back in a box!&quot;). The Mattel CEO and
        his subordinates pursued Barbie back to Barbie Land, where to Barbie's
        shock, she learned that the newly-empowered Ken dolls had taken over
        the society and enslaved the Barbies as compliant girlfriends, maids,
        and housewives. A speech about expectations by Gloria: (&quot;Never forget
        that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that, but also
        always be grateful&quot;) inspired Barbie (and others) to be confident enough to save Barbie Land,
        by turning the Ken dolls against themselves to distract them, while Barbie
        Land's original matriarchal Constitution was restored and reinstated.
        In the film's conclusion, the Mattel CEO agreed to promote equality for
        the Kens, and Barbie was encouraged after a meeting with the spirit of
        Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), Mattel's co-founder and her creator, who
        told her that she was in charge of her own changing destiny: (&quot;We
        mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they've
        come&quot;). Realizing that she had choices in her evolution, Barbie
        decided to return to the real world as a human with the name Barbara
        Handler. </font></p>      </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Boy and the Heron (2023, Jp.)</b>, 124 minutes,
            D: Hayao Miyazaki<br />
          This semi-autobiographical <i>anime</i> fantasy adventure from Studio
          Ghibli (Miyazaki's 12th feature after a 10 year absence) with stunning
          hand-drawn art was similar to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In
          the imaginative coming-of-age tale, the Oscar winner for Best Animated
          Feature Film, it was a story touching on themes of grief, friendship,
          and how to magically come to terms with assaultive Allied forces of
          destruction of B-29 bombers in the real world. In the film's harrowing
          opening set in 1943 during WWII, 12 year-old child Mahito Maki witnessed
          the loss of his mother Hisako in a blazing Tokyo hospital fire. A year
          later, Mahito's businessman father Shoichi Maki - an air munitions
          factory-owner, made plans to immediately marry the boy's Aunt Natsuko
          (his late wife's look-alike younger sister) and impregnate her - and
          the docile female became Mahito's stepmother. The still-grieving, yearning
          and despondent boy, with recurring nightmares of attempting to rescue
          his mother, moved to Natsuko's family's cottage in the Japanese countryside
          - a fairy-tale-like place, where various maids and servants took care
          of needs. Near a remote abandoned tower (built by his stepmother's
          Grand Uncle, an architect and wizard), Mahito met an unusual, enchanted,
          talking gray heron (a hidden  disguise?) who would guide him. The very-depressed
          boy was being bullied in school, and while blaming himself for his
          mother's death, he also was inflicting harm on himself by striking
          his head with a rock to cause a concussion. The heron lured Mahito
          to a portal door, along with one of the maids named Kinko, with the
          promise of finding the boy's ill and missing, pregnant stepmother Natsuko,
          who had wandered trancelike into the woods toward the tower. They entered
          into a surreal and fantastical parallel universe (with magical underworlds
          of both the living and dead). The shape-shifting heron  revealed itself
          as a human, wingless Birdman (underneath, he was a small, wizened old
          man with human teeth and gums). They also encountered visually-fantastical
          creatures: a dying and starving species of renegade pelicans, a younger
          version of Kinko as an adept fisherwoman, a female pyrokinetic fire-figure
          named  Himi, and floating cute, white puffy and gelatinous warawaras
          (human spirits or souls with dotted eyes and short appendages) that
          matured and were reborn into humans after floating upwards into the
          real world. However, Mahito was shocked to see that the warawaras were
          being devoured by the pelicans. They were also confronted by large,
          flesh-eating, hungry cannibalistic fascistic green parakeets, led by
          a Mussolini-like Parakeet King, who were holding the pregnant Natsuko
          captive. Natsuko was being kept in a delivery room within the magical
          tower, protected by paper seals. Their plan was to use her unborn child
          in their quest to rule and control the world. Mahito
          became friends with Lady Himi (whose gift of fire connected her to
          his mother's tragic death) and then realized that she represented a
          younger version of his birth mother. She was accepting of her fate
          when warned by Mahito, and returned to her own time to be his mother.
          The young boy became a hero when he had to rescue his new stepmother
          Natsuko in this other worldly environment, and he learned to become
          more appreciative and accepting of her. As
          the film progressed, it was unclear where the narrative was going.
          In a dream, Mahito met his deceased Granduncle, the wizard, who was
          struggling to maintain balance in this miraculous world with a set
          of stone rocks or building blocks (although they were filled with impurities
          or malice). The Granduncle offered Mahito wisdom and wanted him to
          become his heir and successor and inherit his role. Mahito was given
          a choice - remain in the magical realm and try to recreate it into
          something more peaceful, or return to the real world with grief, pain,
          and sadness. The Granduncle's nephew decided to leave and return home
          - now accepting of his new stepmother, and knowing that he could never
          build a perfect world without pain or malice. 
            It appeared that the boy was psychologically transformed, and had
            dealt with his traumatic grief and distress over his mother's passing,
            and was learning how to cope: (&quot;Whether
        this world becomes beautiful or an abomination is entirely in our hands&quot;). </font></p>        </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>The Holdovers (2023),</b> 133 minutes, D: Alexander
          Payne<br />
          Director Alexander Payne's unique, character-driven, slice-of-life
          dramedy (a combination of drama and dark comedy) with great performances
          from its main cast was scripted by first-timer David Hemingson. The
          plot took place in 1970 over the Christmas holidays at the elitist
          Barton Academy, a remote New England all-boys boarding prep-school.
          The story followed a situation brought on when students who had no
          family to visit during the break had to remain and stay on-campus.
          The film's main character was stern, bad-tempered, pompous, rigid and
          discipline-minded Ancient Civilizations history teacher Paul Hunham
          (Paul Giamatti), an alumnus of the school himself, who preferred to
          be alone, didn't care much for other students or teachers, and his
          motto was: &quot;Life
          is like a henhouse ladder. S--ty and short.&quot; He found himself
          'punished' by the school's headmaster Dr. Hardy Woodrip (Andrew Garman)
          for losing one of the Academy's parent-donors when the graduating student's
          failing grade in Hunham's class cost him entry into Princeton University.
          Without family or friends to care for, Hunham was reprimanded by being
          forced to remain at school with five &quot;holdovers,&quot; but
          as it turned out, only one remained after six days - a misbehaving,
          quickly angry, but smart 15 year-old student named Angus Tully (Dominic
          Sessa) from a troubled family, who risked being expelled. The only
          other individuals left at the school were the school's African-American
          head cook and cafeteria administrator Mary Lamb (Oscar-winning Da'Vine
          Joy Randolph) and the school's janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia). The film's
          strength was in how it authentically portrayed the three-some &quot;family&quot; (functioning
          as a father, mother, and son) during their two weeks together. During
          a Christmas Eve party, the grumpy, witty, and fatherly Paul vainly
          attempted to flirt with the school's deputy headmistress Miss Lydia
          Crane (Carrie Preston), but the bereaving Mary's emotional breakdown
          over her son's recent death in the Vietnam War aborted their attendance.
          In the film's second half, as a Christmas 'gift,' the three took a &quot;field
          trip&quot; to Boston. Mary visited her pregnant sister in Roxbury,
          while Paul and Angus bonded through activities including ice skating
          and a Museum of Fine Arts visit. Through their interactions, Paul came
          to admit that he had been lying about his career's past (he hadn't
          graduated from Harvard University, but had been expelled for a warranted,
          but violent assault against his roommate). After a visit to Angus'
          institutionalized father Thomas Tully (Stephen Thorne) in a sanitorium,
          the film's pivotal scene occurred in a restaurant. The teen learned
          from Paul that he shouldn't worry about repeating mistakes from the
          past and becoming like his father, but through his own power of change
          could develop into his own true and independent self: (&quot;You're
          your own man. Man, no. You're just a kid. You're just beginning. And
          you're smart. You've got time to turn things around... In real life,
          your history does not have to dictate your destiny&quot;). The film
          concluded on an unexpected and bittersweet note - after the vacation
          period ended, Angus' mother Judy Clotfelter (Gillian Vigman) and stepfather
          Stanley Clotfelter (Tate Donovan) reported to the Headmaster about
          Angus' unauthorized visit to the institution, and threatened to send
          their undisciplined boy to military school. Paul took the blame for
          the mishap and was fired. There would be   new beginnings
          for each of the three protagonists. </font></p>      </td>

            D: Martin Scorsese<br />
          Director Martin Scorsese's epic-length, historically-based, western
          crime drama about injustice and exploitation was co-scripted by Scorsese
          and Eric Roth. They based their screenplay on American journalist David
          Grann's 2017 best-selling, non-fiction book about the infamous &quot;Osage
          (County) Murders&quot; that occurred in Oklahoma in the early 1920s.
          The film's title referred to the description of the full moon in the
          month of May, known as a &quot;Flower Moon,&quot; due to the spring-time
          blossoming of flowers at that time of the year. The dilemma of the
          Osage tribal members came after the discovery of massive oil deposits
          on their undesirable Indian land (where the tribes had been resettled
          from their ancestral homelands decades earlier), and they were destined
          as inheritors to become wealthy due to the sale of the oil. At the
          time, the law judged that the full and half-blood tribal members were &quot;incompetent&quot; and
          could not manage their funds properly, thereby necessitating the appointment
          of legal guardians of the money by white courts to handle their trust
          funds. A nefarious and conspiratorial plot was concocted to defraud
          them and to eliminate as many Osage as possible. In the film's plot,
          greedy and gullible non-combat WWI veteran Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo
          DiCaprio) returned to Fairfax, OK to live with his younger brother
          Byron (Scott Shepherd) and his uncle William &quot;Bill&quot; Hale
          (Robert DeNiro), known as &quot;King.&quot; Part-time Deputy Sheriff,
          political boss and cattle rancher Hale owned a large ranch on the Osage
          reservation, and seemingly was friends with the Osage people - speaking
          their language. The cunning and sinister mastermind &quot;King&quot; opportunistically
          used his naive and dim-witted nephew Ernest as a pawn to court and
          marry Osage heiress Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), whose family had
          property rights (or headrights) to the oil land. Their twisted love
          story was, unbeknownst to her, part of their complex plot to eliminate
          the Osage inheritors one by one, by whatever means, and acquire their
          rights to the oil fortune: (&quot;When these women die of these illnesses,
          you have to make sure that these head-rights come to you. That's the
          way it is&quot;). Soon after, Mollie's sister Minnie (Jillian
          Dion) died of a mysterious &quot;wasting disease,&quot; her other sister
          Anna Brown (Cara Jade Myers) was murdered (by Byron with a shot to
          the head, but made to look like a suicide), and her mother Lizzie Q
          (Tantoo Cardinal) also died of old age (but was possibly poisoned?).
          The &quot;King&quot; also
          ordered Ernest to murder Mollie's previous first husband and cousin
           Henry Roan (William Belleau) to acquire the payoff of his life insurance,
          but the killing was botched, and Ernest was punished by being 'paddled'
          by his uncle. There was a direct correlation, viewed in vintage newsreels,
          between the Osage Murders and the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. Incredibly,
          the many suspicious deaths didn't warrant any investigations. After
          a tribal council meeting, a representative of the Osage Nation was
          sent to Washington, D.C., to address the Indian Affairs office, but
          he was bludgeoned to death in a ditch. A private
          detective secretly hired by Mollie, William J. Burns (Gary Basaraba),
          was also beaten up when dispatched to the town. Mollie's last sister
          Reta (or Rita) (JaNae Collins) with her husband, was killed in a massive
          house explosion. Mollie joined a delegation to Washington DC to pressure
          President Calvin Coolidge to send help. The newly-formed BOI (Bureau
          of Investigation, the future FBI by the mid-1930s) under J. Edgar Hoover
          eventually began to investigate the series of horrendous murders by
          sending ex-Texas Ranger Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Bruce White (Jesse Plemons) to Oklahoma. He was able
          to arrest Hale and Ernest, but in the meantime, Ernest had been slowly
          poisoning his diabetic wife Mollie with insulin tainted with heroin,
          and she was near death before being saved. Cattleman William Hale was
          eventually tried and convicted of masterminding the many murders after
          Ernest decided to testify against him. In the film's downplayed epilogue,
          a Hoover-endorsed radio show summarized the aftermath of the trial,
          including convictions and prison terms for Ernest and &quot;King,&quot; </font></p>        </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Maestro (2023),</b> 129 minutes, D: Bradley Cooper<br />
        Star/director Bradley Cooper's biographical love story followed the complex
            romance between talented NY conductor-composer Leonard &quot;Lennie&quot; Bernstein
            (Bradley Cooper) and actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein (Carey
            Mulligan). The film opened with almost 70 year-old Bernstein providing
            a flashback, while seated at the piano, in his home during an interview.
            He recalled when at the age of 25 (in 1943) when he was serving as
            assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, he received his
            big career break by filling in as lead conductor at Carnegie Hall.
            In 1946, he met his future wife Felicia Montealegre at a party, and
            during their 25 year marriage, they had three children: Jamie, Alexander,
            and Nina. Throughout his affluent married life living in NYC, the
            indulgent Bernstein continued to conduct infidelities in homosexual
            affairs (known by Felicia), and also succumbed to alcohol and drug
            abuse. In the early 1970s, they viciously argued about his unfaithfulness.
            She accused him of having hate in his heart, and warned: &quot;If
            you're not careful, you're going to die a lonely old queen.&quot; His
            defense was: &quot;I love people so much that it's hard for me to
            be alone.&quot; A few years later, the ever-devoted Felicia retracted her earlier accusation
            about his hate (&quot;There is no hate... there is no hate in your
            heart&quot;). Tragedy struck in 1978 when Felicia died from an advanced case of
            breast cancer, and Bernstein was left to grieve over his past life
            with her. </font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>May December (2023), </b>117 minutes, D: Todd Haynes<br />
        Director Todd Haynes' dark comedy and toxic-female melodrama was from
            a scripted by Samy Burch and based on a story by Burch and Alex Mechanik.
            The plot was loosely derived from a disturbing tabloid story from
            1992 regarding a scandalous romance between schoolteacher Mary Kay
            Letourneau and 13 year-old 7th grader Vili Fualaau. Their salacious
            relationship (they were caught having sex in a pet store) concluded
            with Letourneau's jailing for statuatory rape. In this film adaptation
            set about 23 years later in Savannah, GA, 36 year old Gracie Atherton-Yoo
            (Julianne Moore), a lispy former school teacher, had left her ex-husband
            Tom Atherton (D. W. Moffett) in 1992 for one of her 13-year-old students
            named Joe Yoo (Charles Melton). They were still together in a married
            relationship with three children: college student Honor (Piper Curda),
            and high-school-aged grads Charlie (Gabriel Chung) and Mary (Elizabeth
            Yu). The story of their romance was mostly explored through the eyes
            of breathy, untalented TV actress Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman),
            who promised to portray Grace sympathetically, while asking questions
            about the past to better inform her performance (&quot;I want to
            take the person, and figure out why are they like this&quot;). She
            befriended the notorious couple while preparing to play the role
            of the manipulative Gracie in an indie film about the scandal, but
            during her preparations, her presence began to upend the couple.
            In private, Gracie's ex-husband Tom bargained for a job on the film
            crew in exchange for dirt about Gracie's past when she was allegedly
            sexually abused by her two older brothers, including Georgie (Cory
            Michael Smith), now a musician. In a climactic sequence, wounded
            soul Joe finally woke up and realized that at an early and &quot;too
            young&quot; undeveloped age, he had been seduced. He confronted Grace, but she claimed he
            had seduced her (&quot;<i>You</i> seduced <i>me</i>&quot;).
            In the film's final sequence on the set during the filming of their
            sexual indiscretions, Elizabeth begged for multiple takes to perfect
            her role: (&quot;Can we do it again, please? Please? Just for me....Please.
            Please. Wait, it's getting more real&quot;). </font></p>      </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Oppenheimer (2023),</b> 180 minutes, D: Christopher
          Nolan<br />
          Best Picture and Best Director-winning Christopher Nolan's ambitious
          epic and timely dramatic biopic, with a non-linear plotline with flashbacks,
          was stunningly presented with the use of the IMAX 65 mm format. It
          told about the complexity of the title character, J. Robert Oppenheimer
          (Best Actor winner Cillian Murphy). He was known as the &quot;father
          of the atomic bomb,&quot; developed
          in the Manhattan Project, that helped to bring a quick end to WWII.
          However, he was also vilified afterwards for security breaches (and
          Communist sympathies) during the McCarthy hearings of the House Un-American
          Activities Committee in the mid-1950s, as he battled to protect his
          legacy and career, and emotional sanity. The script was based upon
          the 2005 biographical book <i>American Prometheus: The Triumph and
          Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, </i>written
          by nuclear historian Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird. [Note: The title
          of the book referred to the mythic Greek figure of Prometheus who was
          cast out for tricking and rebelling against Zeus by stealing fire from
          the gods and gifting it to humanity - he was cruelly punished. &quot;Prometheus
          stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this he was chained
          to a rock and tortured for eternity.&quot; Similarly, the infamous
          and tormented Oppenheimer, who was oftentimes a pacifist and opposed
          nuclear arms development in the US during the 1950s, was castigated
          by anti-war activists and others for developing nuclear power (opening
          Pandora's Box) that accelerated the arms race and Cold War, and could
          conceivably destroy mankind and the entire world.] In Oppenheimer's
          early days as a frustrated but brilliant doctoral student in the mid-1920s,
          while studying physics at the University of Cambridge, visiting scientist
            Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) urged him to get into the cutting-edge
            field of theoretical physics at the Univ. of G&ouml;ttingen.
          After completing his PhD, he taught at Cal Berkeley and CalTech, and
          married Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Puening
          (Emily Blunt), a biologist and ex-Communist Party member. After
          the discovery of nuclear fission in late 1938, Oppenheimer was recruited
          during the war in 1942 by General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to head
          up the ultra-secret Manhattan Project - a team set up at the Los Alamos
          (NM) Laboratory - to race to develop a nuclear bomb ahead of Nazi Germany's
          nuclear research program. Oppenheimer's continual nemesis was US Atomic
          Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), who was
          ultimately unsuccessful  in his Senate confirmation
          hearing to be in President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Cabinet. The team's nuclear testing (the Trinity test in mid-July 1945) was
          successful, leading the President Truman's ordering of the bombing
          of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan to end the war. Afterwards, the
          haunted and guilt-ridden Oppenheimer led forces to restrict further
          nuclear weapon development, but was punished by his political enemies
          by being called before Congress and having his security clearances
          revoked. Kitty had warned him of his perpetual castigation: &quot;You
          think because you let them tar and feather you that the world will
          forgive you? They won't.&quot; </font></p>        </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Past Lives (2023),</b> 105 minutes, D: Celine Song<br />
      Director Celine Song's debut film presented the themes of unrequited love
          and destiny through the Korean concept of In-Yun (meaning providence
          or fate) - suggesting that people are destined to be with one another
          if their souls have inexplicably crossed paths and overlapped a certain
          number of times. In the film's plotline over a period of 24 years,
          a romance had first developed in South Korea between 12 year-old classmates
          Na Young (Seung Ah Moon as young) and Hae Sung (Seung Min Yim as young)
          - as childhood and grade-school sweethearts. However, their bond was
          broken when Nora's family emigrated to Toronto, Canada. She
          changed her name from Na Young to Nora Moon (Greta Lee as adult). By
          the year 2012, 24 year-old Nora had moved to NYC, and back in South
          Korea, Hae Sung (Teo Yoo as adult) had finished his military service
          and was working as an engineer. The two briefly contacted each other
          through an Internet <i>Facebook</i> post
          and video calls, but were unable to visit each other. Meanwhile, Nora
          married Jewish writer Arthur Zaturansky (John Magaro) during an artists'
          residency program and they resided in NYC in the East Village, but
          she continued to think of Hae Sung. In the present day, Hae
          Sung came for a week-long visit to see Nora. The slightly-insecure Arthur
          expressed suspicious concerns that Nora had married him in order to
          obtain a green card for U.S. residency.  During a restaurant-bar  
          conversation with her husband present, Nora spoke primarily in South
          Korean to Hae Sung - when he asked &quot;what-if&quot; questions
        to her about how they might have been a couple. Hae Sung also told Nora:
          &quot; I didn't know that liking your husband would hurt this much.&quot; For
          part of the evening, Nora acted as an interpreter between Arthur and
          Hae Sung to bring her left-out husband into the conversation. After
          dinner, as Hae Sung waited for an Uber ride outside Nora's apartment,
          Nora and he exchanged a long lengthy glance at each other. With great
          longing, Hae Sung asked the pointed question about whether their lives
          might have taken a different path: &quot;What
          if this is a past life as well, and we are already something else to
          each other in our next life? Who do you think we are then?&quot; Nora
          responded that she didn't know. As Hae Sung departed, he told Nora: &quot;I'll
          see you then.&quot; In
        the tear-jerking ending, Nora walked back into her apartment to cry
        in Arthur's arms.</font></p>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Poor Things (2023),</b> 141 minutes, D: Yorgos Lanthimos</font><br />
        <font size="2">This unique, fantastical, weird sci-fi and black comedy
        &quot;Frankenstein&quot; tale was based upon Alasdair Gray's 1992 novel
        of the same name (adapted by Tony McNamara). It told about the incredible
        odyssey and coming-of-age of a young woman who defied societal norms.
        In Victorian-era England, a pregnant suicide victim named Bella (born
        Victoria Blessington) Baxter (Best Actress-winning Emma Stone) was found
        floating in a river. She was resurrected and brought back to life by
        unorthodox, brilliant mad scientist Dr. Godwin
        &quot;God&quot; Baxter (Willem Dafoe). He replaced her brain with the
        premature, undeveloped brain of her unborn infant child. Dr. Baxter was
        also experimenting with a second child-brain implant on a young woman
        named Felicity (Margaret Qualley). At first, the confused and slow-developing
        Bella learned language, how to behave, and how to act with social manners.
        With permission granted by the patriarchal Godwin, Bella was about to
        marry medical student Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef). But then in pursuit
        of freedom, sexual pleasure, self-discovery, and self-actualization,
        the reanimated, primal, naive and childlike Bella - with wide eyes -
        ventured off with slick, debauched lawyer-lover Duncan Wedderburn (Mark
        Ruffalo) to liberate and find herself in a surrealistically-filmed world.
        As she explored the world opening up to her, she found new challenges,
        learned philosophical ideas, and experienced all forms of hedonism, and
        she began to grow intellectually and emotionally. She was also confronted
        by her own burgeoning female sexuality and individuality, and the societal
        forces of patriarchy. Her journey took her on a cruise ship from Lisbon
        (Portugal) to Alexandria (Egypt) and then to Marseille (France). She
        ventured onward from the southern port to Paris where Bella - after being
        abandoned by Duncan, came under the tutelage of brothel Madame Swiney
        (Kathryn Hunter) and socialist co-worker/prostitute Toinette (Suzy Bemba).
        Max located Bella and returned her to London to be reconciled to ailing,
        terminally-ill Dr. Baxter in her homecoming. During her renewed marriage
        ceremony to Max, Bella's previous husband Alfie Blessington (Christopher
        Abbott) claimed her as his wife. Bella came to understand her past relationship
        to Blessington, who had violently abused her - the reason for her attempted
        suicide. She was forced to escape from him when he attempted to sedate
        her and perform a genital mutilation. As the film concluded, Godwin died
        peacefully, and with Max and Toinette, Bella decided to carry on with
        the scientist's work. A brain operation replaced Alfie's brain with a
        goat brain. </font></p>      </td>

          minutes, D:  Justin
      K. Thompson, Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers<br />
      Marvel Entertainment's epic, visually-inventive, animated superhero film
      was a sequel to <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)</i>. It was the  second film of a planned
      trilogy, to be followed by <i>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse (2024)</i>.
      The film's plot opened about a year after the first film in the multi-verse
      of Earth-65. Teenaged punk-band drummer Gwen
      Stacy (leading a double-life as Spider-Woman) (voice of Hailee Steinfeld)
      lived in a NY borough (Chelsea). She was regarded by her father - police
      captain George Stacy (voice of Shea Whigham) and others - as a fugitive.
      She was desperately trying to keep her Spidy-identity a secret from
      him. She felt isolated and disconnected a year after being blamed for the
      death of her best friend Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man) (voice of Jake Johnson),
      who perished in her arms. In the city during a showdown and confrontation
      at the circular-shaped Guggenheim Museum with the villainous Vulture (voice
      of Jorma Taccone) from the Renaissance Era universe, Gwen was saved by
      another inter-dimensional traveler, Miguel O'Hara (aka Spider-Man 2099)
      (voice of Oscar Isaac), the leader of a group of elite Spider-People joined
      together in a secret Spider Society to protect and police the Multiverse.
      (The goal of the Society was to keep every Spider-Person in their respective
      universe, and to prevent the various multiverses from collapsing from too
      much interference.) Miguel was aided in Gwen's rescue by another Spider-Woman
      known as Jessica Drew (voice of Issa Rae), a pregnant, motorcycle-riding
      African-American from Earth-332. When threatened with arrest by her father,
      Gwen was allowed to join Miguel in the Society and escape  back with them
      to another universe. Meanwhile, in his Brooklyn NY neighborhood deli in 
	  the different universe of Earth-1610, teenaged
      Puerto-Rican Miles Morales (aka Spider-Man) (voice of Shameik Moore), who
      had been mentored by Peter Parker, encountered a new threat
      in the form of supervillain Spot (voice of Jason Schwartzman), a former
      Alchemax research scientist known as Dr. Johnathon Ohnn. [Note: Ohnn's
      experiments on a super collider transported the
      radioactive spider from Earth-42 to Earth-1610, where it bit 
	  Miles and turned him into Spider-Man.] His
      formidable criminal power, as Spider-Man's new nemesis, was due to his
      transformation into a humanoid portal creature with &quot;spots&quot; all over his
      body. They gave him the ability to open interdimensional portals and seamlessly
          travel long distances across the universes. The Spot appeared in Brooklyn
          to rob an ATM, as Miles was scheduled to meet with his parents: police
          officer father Jeff Morales (voice of Brian Tyree Henry) and his mother
          Rio (voice of Lauren V&eacute;lez), a nurse. They were prepared to
        discuss his academic progress at his prep school with his parents and
          guidance counselor. Gwen and Miles met up on Earth-1610 while she was
          tracking the Spot, and they resumed a flirtatious, breath-taking swinging
          relationship through the city at sundown. They also teamed up to combat
          the Spot with local Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar (voice of Karan Soni)
          (aka Spider-Man India) from Earth-50101 who lived in Mumbattan, and
          later Gwen's friend Hobie Brown (aka Spider-Punk) (voice of Daniel
          Kaluuya), a black, anarchist British punk-rock version of Spider-Man
          from Earth-138. However, the vengeful Spot was able to evade capture
          with enhanced powers. At the Spider-Society HQ's in a futuristic Earth-928,
          in Nueva York in the year 2099 where hundreds of Spider-People resided,
          Miles (who was at odds with Miguel for letting the Spot get away) found
          himself imprisoned to prevent him from rescuing his father from certain
          death (prophesied by an algorithm), and upsetting or disrupting the
          delicate balance of the Canon within the multiverses that maintained
          its existence (&quot;The events that bind our lives together&quot;).
		  Miles refused to accept his father's fate,
        and escaped from his cage. He was able to lure all of the Spider-People
        away from their base. After transport in a Go Home Machine, Miles found
        himself, not in his own home dimension, but on Earth-42 - the home of the
        radioactive spider (not from his universe) that bit him. Miguel
        informed Miles that he was the "original anomaly" that set in motion all 
		the multiverse madness, e.g., the death of Earth-1610's Peter Parker, and the
        subsequent problems on the crime-ridden Earth-42 without a Spider-Man
        protector. In fact, Miles was never meant to be Spider-Man. As
          the film concluded (a cliffhanger) and the high-speed pursuit-search
          for Miles continued from multiple vantage points, Miles was preparing
          to evade the hunts and save his father - even though he was risking
      catastrophic consequences. </font></p>      </td>

            D: Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic, Pierre Leduc, Fabien Polack<br />
        This wildly-colorful, energetic animated (CGI) fantasy-adventure comedy
        from Illumination and Universal Pictures was based on Nintendo's <i>Mario
        Bros.'</i> arcade and video games (franchise) beginning in 1983. It also
        followed after the children's TV adaptation <i>The Super Mario Bros.
        Super Show! (1989),</i> and the first feature-length live-action film based on a video game - <i>Super
         Mario Bros. (1993)</i> starring Bob Hoskins and
         John Leguizamo. This self-referential newest entry  
          received average ratings and mixed reviews (most reviewers thought
         it lacked creativity and imagination, felt uneven and rushed, and only
         appealed to its fan base), although it became a major blockbuster -
         and was the highest-grossing film based on a video game. On a budget
         of $100 million, it grossed $575 million (domestic) and $1.36 billion
         (worldwide). The two main title characters in this origin story (who
         were on an heroic journey or odyssey) were the titular Italian brothers,
         Mario (voice of Chris Pratt) and Luigi (voice of Charlie Day), two working-class
         Brooklyn plumbers who had a family-run business. During their work on
         an underground, broken water main, they were sucked through a
         magical green Warp Pipe into another alternate realm. Mario ended up
         in the idyllic Mushroom Kingdom inhabited by Toads, and was separated
         from Luigi who wound up in the scary Dark Lands, where he was kidnapped
         and captured by its Koopa King ruler - the evil and nefarious Bowser
         (voice of Jack Black), who commanded an army of turtles. During the
         film's many adventures with his friends, Mario went on a search to rescue
         his missing brother, allied with and accompanied by the ruler of the
         Mushroom Kingdom Princess Peach (voice of Anya Taylor-Joy), Toad (voice
         of Keegan-Michael Key), and the anthropomorphic gorilla Donkey Kong
         (voice of Seth Rogen) from the neighboring Jungle Kingdom. Complicating
         matters was the fact that Princess Peach was the love interest of both
         Bowser and Mario. Bowser attempted to impress her by boasting that he
         would rule over all the other kingdoms and sacrifice prisoners in burning
         lava. With the aid of his advisor Kamek (voice of Kevin Michael Richardson),
         a Koopa sorcerer, Bowser stole and took possession of the penguins'
         powerful Super Star to use it to threaten his diabolical plan - to both
         court and marry Princess Peach and thereby take control of her Mushroom
         Kingdom. In the film's conclusion during Bowser's forced marriage to
         Princess Peach, he was thwarted by the arrival of Mario and Donkey Kong,
         who were able to free Luigi. The entire group (including Bowser's castle)
         were transported back to Brooklyn through the Warp Pipe. By grabbing
         onto the Super Star, Mario and Luigi saved themselves, and then Bowser's
         Koopa troops (and his castle) were destroyed. In the
         happy ending, Bowser was rendered powerless and shrunk by Peach with
         a Blue Mushroom before his imprisonment. The two brothers moved
         back to the Mushroom Kingdom to live and work there. </font></p>        </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Talk to Me (2023, Australia/UK),</b> 95 minutes, D: Danny
          Philippou, Michael Philippou<br />
          This terrifying and tense supernatural horror and mystery-thriller
          from Australia and the UK (with A24 as its US distributor) was co-written
          and co-directed by the twin Philippou brothers with their feature directorial
          debut. It boasted two release dates (Australia in 2022, and the US/UK
          in 2023), adding to confusion about which year to attribute for the
          film. Its low budget of $4.5 million translated to huge box-office
          profits and revenues: $48.3 million (domestic), and $92 million (worldwide).
          The film's story presented the themes of loss, grief and tragedy as
          the result of refusing to let go or and holding on for too long. After
          a short prologue with an unexplained stabbing murder of one of two
          brothers (Cole and Duckett) during a house party in Australia, the
          plot followed the troubled life of teenaged 17 year-old Mia (Sophia
          Wilde), who was still recuperating from her mother Rhea's (Alexandria
          Steffensen) drug-overdose and suicidal death two years earlier. She
          also remained distant and estranged from her father Max (Marcus Johnson).
          Most of the time, Mia was staying with her best friend Jade (Alexandra
          Jensen), Jade's 14 year-old brother Riley (Joe Bird), and their unaware
          single mother Sue (Miranda Otto), who worked the night shift. The teens
          attended a trendy, thrill-seeking house party hosted by Hayley (Zoe
          Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio) for a basement conjuring-seance. It
          was discovered how communication (or possession) with an undead spirit,
          via opening a supernatural gateway or portal to the underworld, was
          possible by gripping a severed and embalmed talisman (a hand, possibly
          of a Satanist or medium, encased with a ceramic covering). Mia volunteered
          to experience the thrill of conjuring up a deceased person's spirit
          during the ceremonial procedure, including lighting a
          candle, opening a connection by intoning the phrase: &quot;Talk
          to Me,&quot; taking ahold of the hand, and then allowing the spirit
          to inhabit oneself and take full possession: (&quot;I let you in&quot;).
          One of the rules of the interaction was that contact with the spirit
          should not last any longer than the &quot;safe
          limit&quot; of 90 seconds - requring others in attendance to blow
          out the candle and release the hand. Mia's
          experience turned threatening (mostly toward Riley) and verged out
          of control after 90 seconds. The situation was saved and Mia was restored
          to her normal self when Josh and Haley ended the possession by extinguishing
          the candle and pushing the hand away. At Jade's house the following
          night, in the company of Hayley, Joss, and Jade's boyfriend Daniel
          (Otis Dhanji) for another conjuring or possession party experience,
          the haunted Mia allowed Riley to become taken by Rhea's spirit, while
          simultaneously seeming to reconcile with the spirit of her late dead
          mother Rhea. However, evil spirits forced Riley to horrifically and
          suicidally injure himself. While Riley was hospitalized, the fully-possessed,
          self-blaming Mia continued to speak to her manipulative mother's 'benevolent'
          spirit (more probably an evil entity imposter pretending to be her
          mother) - even without the use of the hand. An hallucination of her
          father Max attacking her caused Mia to stab him. Mia's
          mother convinced her that she needed to stab Riley to death with the
          same pair of scissors she had accidentally stabbed her father with,
          in order to free Riley. In a nailbiting sequence, Mia instead
          chose to wheel Riley out of the hospital and into oncoming traffic.
          In an attempt to save Riley, Jade intervened and Mia lurched into the
          traffic on the highway and was bloodied and lethally injured. In the
          hospital, Mia (with disfigured hands and no mirror reflection) was
          literally dead. In the obvious ending, Mia was in limbo and darkness,
          now acting as a lost dead spirit interacting with a hand extended over
          a candle during a conjuring session in Greece, as a party-goer spoke: &quot;I
          let you in.&quot; </font></p></td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>The Zone of Interest (2023),</b> 105 minutes, D: Jonathan
      Glazer<br />
      British co-writer/director Jonathan Glazer's history-based, non-English
      language drama (his fourth film) was adapted from Martin Amis' 2014 novel
      of the same name, about the unseen evils and horrors of the Holocaust viewed
      through the everyday domestic and mundane daily life of the family of one
      of its main Nazi Germany officers. It was the winner of the Oscar for Best
      International Feature Film. The dispassionate yet highly-effective portrayal
      was enhanced by a haunting Mica Levi score. The observational film's opening
      sequence with black title screens then followed with an idyllic and peaceful
      family picnic scene beside a river in the year 1943. The family was headed
      by Rudolf H&ouml;ss
      (Christian Friedel), his devoted wife Hedwig (Sandra H&uuml;ller), and
      their five children, who were attempting to attain a dream life. The shocking
      revelation was that Hoss was the highly-calculating, cruel commanding officer
      (Obersturmf&uuml;hrer) of the Auschwitz concentration &quot;death camp&quot; and
      its wall that bordered the family's spacious home property, with visible
      barbed wire, a watchtower, and a chimney. To imply complicity with the
      horrific situation and to keep the viewing audience alert to searching
      for various clues to the situation, director Glazer wisely never explicitly
      showed anything that was happening over the nearby tall concrete wall,
      except for diagetic audio sounds (barking dogs, torture screams, shouting,
      gun fire, boot footsteps, train whistles from arriving and departing trains,
      humming machinery and furnace sounds, etc.) and some suggestive visual
      images (human ash remains in the air and in the river, light from night
      fires, steam from death camp trains, a collection of gold teeth, etc.)
      that could be interpreted in a number of ways. Hoss' dehumanizing responsibilities
      included overseeing plans for a new and more efficient extermination and
      eradication facility (gas chamber and crematorium), as he abstractly talked
      about &quot;pieces,&quot; a &quot;combustion zone,&quot; and &quot;loads&quot;
      (or &quot;reloads&quot;) of Jewish bodies passing through the facility.
      Meanwhile, his stern wife Frau Hedwig Hoss, with three maidservants (prisoners),
      tended to her home's sprawling garden and greenhouse, outdoor swimming
      pool, and oversaw deliveries of seized and confiscated items from the camp's
      prisoners, including fur coats that she grabbed for herself. Recognition
      of the obvious problem nearby was evidenced by the arrival of Hedwig's
      mother for a visit, who promptly left unannounced in the darkness of the
      night. When Hoss was relocated to Berlin, Germany for a few months, Hedwig
      was given special permission to remain behind to continue living her dreamy,
      complacent and routine life in their home. When Rudolf returned, his newest
      commission was to transport Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz to be more efficiently
      exterminated.</font> </p>      </td>
