        Diament)</b>, 103 minutes, D: Andrzej Wajda<br />
          Polish director Wajda's political post war-time drama about the theme
          of fate was the last film in a so-called &quot;Underground Trilogy,&quot; coming
          after <i>Pokolenie (1955, Pol.) (aka A Generation) </i> and <i>Kanal
          (1957, Pol.)</i>. It was adapted from source material - provided by
          Polish writer Jerzy Andrzejewski's 1948 novel with the same title.
          Set in 1945 in Poland (struggling to rise from the &quot;ashes&quot; of
          war with new leaders), young ex-Home Army soldiers Maciek Che&#322;micki
          (Zbigniew Cybulski, a &quot;Polish James Dean&quot;), Andrzej (Adam Pawlikowski)
          and Drewnowski (Bogumi&#322; Kobiela)
          were members of the anti-Communist underground Resistance movement
          in Nazi German-occupied Poland during World War II. At the close of
          the war, in the small Polish town of Ostrowiec, two of the underground
          soldiers-hitmen Maciek (with signature dark sunglasses) and Andrzej
          were ordered by Major Waga (Ignacy Machowski) to commit one final assassination
          - the murder of Konrad Szczuka (Wac&#322;aw
          Zastrze&#380;y&#324;ski), an influential political opponent and leading
          Communist and the local secretary of the Polish Workers' Party who
          had been accused of Nazi collaboration.  A mixup during a planned car
          ambush led to the violent deaths of two innocent factory workers. The
          back of the coat of one individual  burst into flames (one of the film's
          metaphors was fire) as he was gunned down, causing him to fall through
          a church door and reveal a statue of the Virgin Mary inside. </font><font size="2">Maciek
          had failed in his mission to murder the newly-appointed district secretary
            Commissar Szczuka. The two assassins checked into
            the rundown Hotel Monopol where Szczuka was to attend a large political
            banquet. In the hotel's bar, Maciek became flirtatious with
            the hotel's charming barwoman Krystyna (Ewa Krzyzewska), and after
            having sex with her in his room that night, they walked through the
          destroyed city with fresh corpses to a ruined church with an upside-down
          Jesus crucifix. They discussed poetry and whether there would be diamonds
            amongst the ashes in their shell-shocked nation now that the war
              was over. Their romantic time together sidetracked and weakened
              the youthful patriot's idealistic resolve as an assassin on a mission.
              Szczuka learned that his son Marek (Jerzy Jogalla) had been arrested
              for joining a partisan group - an underground militia. This revelation
              allowed Maciek to carry out his mission a second time - when Szczuka
              left the hotel alone at night to confer with his captured son,
              Maciek followed in the street and after shooting Szczuka dead,
              the victim clung to him. The gunshots at midnight were undetected
              when overshadowed by the sounds of celebratory fireworks. The next
              day, the struggling Maciek was faced with a crucial decision -
              should he remain committed to the cause that risked his life, or
              follow after his new love? He decided - probably unwisely - that
              it would be self-destructive and futile to try and build a life
              with the blonde barmaid Krystyna, and prepared to leave town by
              train. After a painful parting with the heartbroken Krystyna,
            Maciek - on his way to the train station - panicked when he was identified
            by double-crossing Drewnowski and soldiers in the Polish People's
          Army. He was fatally shot during flight, and died curled up in a fetal
          position on a garbage dump heap.</font></p>          </td>

        Director Morton DaCosta's commercially-successful, Technicolored comedic
            drama was based on Patrick Dennis' 1955 novel of the same name about
            an eccentric and zesty Bohemian aunt. Best Actress-nominated Rosalind
            Russell portrayed the title character - a recreation of her successful
            1956-1958 Broadway stage role. Her most famous line of dialogue was
            her life's motto: &quot;Life is a banquet - and most poor suckers
            are starving to death.&quot; The film opened with the unexpected
            death of wealthy conservative Chicago businessman Edwin Dennis in
            mid-September of 1928 in Chicago, just one day after he executed
            his will and testament. It was stipulated that Edwin's sole heir
            to his estate, his 10 year-old son Patrick Dennis (Jan Handzlik as
            young boy), would be raised as the ward of Edwin's only living relative
            -- his elegantly flamboyant, ascerbic, equally-wealthy, wisecracking,
            free-spirited spinster sister Mame Dennis (Rosalind Russell) who
            resided in Manhattan in NYC at 3 Beekman Place. It was the 1920s
            - a time of flappers, bootleg alcohol, and bohemian lifestyles. To
            help protect orphaned Patrick from undue influences, his longtime
            Irish nanny Norah Muldoon (Connie Gilchrist) accompanied him to New
            York. They arrived in the midst of one of Mame's lavish parties,
            who was serving caviar, some pickled octopus and raw fish tails to
            the guests. Surprisingly, the well-mannered Patrick got along quite
            well with Mame, who immediately exposed him to her socialite friends
            and their quirky behavior, including Broadway actress Vera Charles'
            (Coral Browne) heavy drinking, the nudist lifestyle of Acacius Page
            (Henry Brandon) - the progressive headmaster of Bixby School (an
            experimental school in Greenwich Village where he bragged: &quot;At
            my school, we wear nothing. It's heaven!&quot;),
          and Mame's publisher boyfriend Lindsay Woolsey
          (Patric Knowles).  Mame promised Patrick:
              &quot;Your Auntie Mame will open doors for you. Doors you never
          even dreamed existed. What times we'll have!&quot; The
          trustee of the will, stuffy Mr. Dwight Babcock (Fred Clark) associated
          with the conservative Knickerbocker Bank, was instructed to insure
          that the orphaned nephew of his &quot;crazy&quot; Aunt was protected
          from any of Mame's many unconventional ideas or eccentric attitudes
          and friends (&quot;We must spare the boy certain
            influences from the wrong side of the tracks&quot;). Babcock
          stated his preference to  enroll Patrick in St. Boniface Academy, an
          exclusive boys' boarding school in Massachusetts - his own alma mater,
          away from Mame's daily influence; however Auntie Mame recommended the
          Bixby School; but after Babcock visited the school, he was
            flabbergasted: &quot;There they were! A school room full of them!
            Boys, girls, teachers, romping around stark naked, bare as the day
            they were born&quot;; he moved Patrick to St. Boniface, to restrict
            contact with Mame only during holidays and during the summer.  Other
          problems arose when the stock market crashed in late 1929 and Mame
          lost all of her fortune (&quot;Nothing's worth anything anymore&quot;).
          Refusing to marry Lindsay in order to provide her with security, she
          broke off her relationship with him. Mame realized that she must settle
          down on her own, earn some money, and try a series of work-jobs as
          the &quot;only chance to get Patrick back,&quot; including a return
          to the stage in a bit part, and working as a switchboard operator.
          During a short time as a Macy's Department store sales clerk before
          being fired, she met her new future husband - wealthy Southern oil
          baron Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside (Forrest Tucker) from Georgia.Mame's
          whirlwind romance and world-tour honeymoon with him tragically ended
          when he died in 1937 - he fell off a cliff on the Matterhorn while
          taking pictures. Patrick (Roger Smith as older), who
          had grown into adulthood, persuaded Mame to write her autobiography
          to be published by Lindsay. For some
          months, Mame dictated her memoirs to stenographer-secretary Agnes Gooch
          (Peggy Cass). Mame was also romanced by her live-in Irish fortune-hunting
          ghostwriter-editor Brian O'Bannion (Robin Hughes). In the meantime,
            Patrick unexpectedly became engaged to a Babcock-approved girlfriend
          named Gloria Upson (Joanna Barnes) - a spoiled, shallow, dumb-blonde
          with boorish, snooby, anti-Semitic parents, Claude and Doris Upson
          (Willard Waterman and Lee Patrick). Mame broke her date to a party
          with O'Bannion, to sabotage his greedy intentions by diverting his
          interest toward a transformed and drunken Agnes, resulting in her unexpected
          pregnancy and &quot;unwed mother&quot; relationship to O'Bannion (later,
          Agnes remembered that they were married). To learn more about Patrick's
          fiancee Gloria, Mame visited the bourgeois Upsons, who lived in a house
          known as &quot;Upson Downs&quot; in the Connecticut community of Mountebank,
          where she personally witnessed their abhorrent, superficial and anti-Semitic
          behavior, and was dismayed by their plans for her nephew Patrick. A
          few weeks before Patrick's wedding to Gloria, Mame invited many of
          the film's priincipal characters to an &quot;intimate
          family dinner&quot; party in her apartment,
          when the release of Mame's autobiography was to be announced and chapters
          of the &quot;red-hot&quot; galleys were distributed. Hostess Mame had
          specifically designed the party to make the Upsons uncomfortable, and
          force Patrick to cancel his wedding plans. During the awkward
          night, Gloria insulted Patrick by calling his acquaintances &quot;riff-raff.&quot; Mame
          also insulted Gloria's parents by having Lindsay declare that her
          book's royalties would support a home for refugee Jewish children in
          Mountebank, in the Epstein's property next-door to the Upsons.  When
          the news was blurted out, it was the ultimate straw and Mame cried
          out: &quot;JACKPOT!&quot; The family of Upsons
          left in a huff. Incensed and insulted with what had just happened,
             Babcock claimed his duty was to protect Patrick from Mame's &quot;idiotic,
             cockeyed nincompoopery&quot;; he was also
             dismissed by Mame for manipulating and controlling her nephew's
          life. Patrick - who had become recently attracted
          to Mame's new secretary Pegeen Ryan (Pippa Scott), broke off his engagement
          to Gloria. Years later in the film's epilogue in 1946, 28 year-old
             Patrick had married Pegeen and they had a son named Michael, who
             would now experience life with Mame on an exotic trip to India before
             his school began in the fall. She offered him the same promise given
             to Patrick years earlier: &quot;I'm
             going to open doors for you. Doors you never even dreamed existed....&quot; </font></p>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Big Country (1958), </b>166 minutes, D: William
              Wyler
              <br />
          William Wyler's spectacular widescreen, beautifully-photographed,
          Technicolored Western epic was based upon Donald Hamilton's originally
          serialized <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> magazine novel &quot;Ambush
          at Blanco Canyon&quot; that was published in 1958. The film opened
          with a memorable Saul Bass credits sequence, and Jerome Moross' sweeping
          and robust thematic score. Transplanted Maryland ex-sea captain James
          McKay (Gregory Peck) - a thoughtful, smart, and basically pacifist
          'tenderfoot' arrived in the cattle town of San Rafael, TX. He was there
          to claim his fiancee-bride Patricia Terrill (Carroll Baker) (an only
          child, who had met McKay back East when she was in school); instead,
          he became caught up in her father's civil war feud over water rights
          at an adjoining ranch known as &quot;The Big Muddy&quot; (where a vital
          water source was located) - owned but no longer operated by the Maragon
          family. Various other main characters were introduced: patriarchal
              cattle-baron landowner &quot;The Major&quot; Henry Terrill (Charles
              Bickford), his main rancher-rival and reprobate Rufus Hannassey
              (Oscar-winning Burl Ives), Terrill's cocky and rough-hewn foreman
              Steve Leech (Charlton Heston), Rufus' no-good drunken son Buck
              (Chuck Connors), and Patricia's schoolteacher friend Julie Maragon
              (Jean Simmons) who had inherited &quot;The Big Muddy&quot; from
              her grandfather, but no longer operated the Maragon ranch.  The
              highly-disciplined McKay tamed a wild bronco stallion named &quot;Old
              Thunder&quot;  - to meet the challenge given to him by Terrill's foreman Steve
              Leech. Early on, a confrontational scene occurred
              over access rights to water at &quot;The Big Muddy&quot; between
              Rufus Hannassey and his rich rival enemy Major Henry Terrill, when
              Rufus burst into Terrill's house (during a gala party to celebrate
              Patricia's engagement), berated Terrill, and delivered a major
              ultimatum - as well as calling him a hypocrite for harrassing his
          wild clan of women and children. McKay made private
          efforts to intervene and bring peace between the Hannasseys and the
          McKays by offering to buy the Maragon ranch land from Julie Maragon
          (as a wedding present for Patricia) where &quot;The Big Muddy&quot; was
          located - to continue to keep the river free and accessible for both
          ranchers. Patricia separated and essentially broke up with McKay by
          the film's conclusion due to her disenchantment with his perceived
          cowardice and peace-making efforts. At the end of a marathon pre-dawn,
           memorable outdoor fist-fight (&quot;not
          with horses or guns&quot;) without witnesses
          (sometimes filmed in long-shot) between non-violent McKay
          and the dislikeable Steve Leech, McKay ultimately questioned the
           futility of their fight when it ended in a draw: &quot;Tell
                    me Leech. What did we prove? Huh?&quot; The  film concluded
                    with Rufus Hannassey's planned ambush of Major Terrill in
                    Blanco Canyon, by taking Julie Maragon hostage (not knowing
                    that she had already sold her land to McKay). There, a gentlemen's
                    duel (with dueling pistols) was instigated between Hannassey's
                    hot-headed son Buck and McKay - with Rufus officiating; Buck
                    fired early (and just grazed McKay's forehead) and was reprimanded
                  by his father - ending with cowardly Buck's death by his own
                  honorable father when Buck unfairly stole another man's gun
                    and was about to kill the unarmed McKay. Rufus
                    agonized over the death of his own disreputable son:  &quot;I
                    warned you, you dirty little...I told ya! I told ya I'd do
                    it. I told you, but you wouldn't believe me! Damn your soul,
                    I told you!&quot; Another final stalking and deadly showdown
                    occurred in Blanco Canyon between the two sole warlord protagonists:
                    Terrill and Hannassey. It ended with both unyielding men
                    squaring off against each other and killing each other with
                    rifles - one lying on top of the other (filmed from a high-angle
                    long shot). This brought peace after the violent confrontation
              between the two families that eliminated the two old-men protagonists;
        McKay rode off with Julie to start their new life together. </font></p>        </td>

              Liberal director-filmmaker Stanley Kramer, well-known for directing
              heavy-handed, social issues dramas (such as <i><a href="inhe.html">Inherit
              the Wind (1960)</a> </i> and <i>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)</i>),
              helmed this social commentary film about racism. The film had 9
              Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director,
              Best Actor (Tony Curtis), Best Actor (Sidney Poitier), Best Supporting
              Actor (Theodore Bikel), Best Supporting Actress (Cara Williams),
              and Best Film Editing, and won two Oscars: Best
              B/W Cinematography and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written
              Directly for the Screen (Nedrick Young and Harold Jacob Smith). Two
              chain-gang convicts in the 1950s South - bigoted white Southerner
              John &quot;Joker&quot; Jackson (Tony Curtis) (convicted of armed robbery) and black
                Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier, the first black actor to star in
                mainstream Hollywood films in non-stereotyped roles) (incarcerated
                for assault and battery) were shackled together. When they escaped
                from an overturned transport truck during a rainstorm, they had
                to cooperate with each other and put aside their racial animosities
                as they evaded the oppressive search of the police. Held together
                by a 29 inch steel chain, they were manacled to each other, and
                only bound by their will and determination to escape. Their pursuit
                was headed up by a local &quot;humanitarian&quot;
          - the liberal and compassionate Sheriff Max Muller (Theodore Bikel),
          with other more redneck state troopers and police officers with vicious
          tracking dogs. Although captured at Jackson's former place of work
          (a turpentine camp 60 miles to the north), they were confronted by
          Mack (Claude Akins) and a threatening lynch mob, although Big Sam (Lon
          Chaney, Jr.) stepped in and halted the bloodthirsty injustice, and
          then released the two to escape in the middle of the night. At an isolated
          farm house, they were cared for by needy, lonesome, abandoned and love-starved
          single mother (Cara Williams). Her devious plan to send Cullen off
          into the swamp while she ran off with Jackson to the city backfired
          when she betrayed his trust. Jackson chased after Cullen and told him:
          &quot;That woman told you wrong.&quot; The film's
          classic image was of their clapsed white and black hands of the two
          desperately trying to help each other board a speeding train - Cullen
          reached back to pull Jackson up, but couldn't save him (&quot;I can't
          make it! I can't make it!&quot;) and sacrificed his own freedom by
          jumping off. In the conclusion, Cullen defiantly sang the blues song &quot;Long
          Gone&quot; - with the wounded Jackson lying in his arms, before the
          two were apprehended by Sheriff Muller. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>I Want to Live! (1958),</b> 120 minutes, D: Robert
              Wise<br />
              Director Robert Wise's  film-noirish, low-budget, gritty biographical
              (yet heavily fictionalized) crime drama (with an original rhythmic
              jazzy score) was a clear indictment of capital punishment. The
              screenplay was based on magazine and newspaper articles, court
              transcripts, and personal letters from the imprisoned and condemned
              defendant. Non-violent petty criminal (burglary, forgery, perjury),
              prostitute (&quot;party
              girl&quot;), and drug addict Barbara Graham (Academy-Award winning
               Susan Hayward) was also associated with West Coast low-life, underworld
          figures in San Francisco's Tenderloin area. The
          street-wise seemingly tough female acted as a &quot;shill&quot;
          - bringing in unsuspecting men to be fleeced at a gambling parlor.
          Graham was charged by a grand jury with the brutal murder of crippled,
          64 year-old widow Mrs. Mabel Monahan during a robbery attempt in her
          Burbank, CA home in March of 1953, along with three known criminal
          accomplices: Emmett Perkins (Philip Coolidge), John R. 'Jack' Santo
          (Lou Krugman), and Bruce King (James Philbrook). Reportedly, the murder
          victim had $100,000 hidden somewhere in her home, but wouldn't divulge
          where. Underground figure King was apprehended at the scene, turned
          state's evidence, and ratted on the location of Graham and her petty
          associates in Lynwood, CA. The three suspected murderers were now in
          custody. Although Graham was questioned thoroughly, she defiantly claimed
          her innocence, but her sordid past would cause her to be regarded as
          guilty from the start (without presumption of innocence). For the trial,
          she was defended by attorney Richard Tibrow (Gage Clarke). During the
          trial, suspect King had been granted immunity, and claimed that Graham
          was a partner in the crime (she was nicknamed
          &quot;Bloody Babs&quot;). She had no solid or credible alibi - it
            couldn't be proved that she was home with her shifty, drug-addicted
            bartender-husband Henry/Hank Graham (Wesley Lau) and young child
            on the evening of the crime. Wired undercover police detective Ben
            Miranda (Peter Breck) entrapped the desperate and anxious Graham
            (fearing the death penalty) into confessing, when she was falsely
            promised an alibi. She was convicted of the crime in 1954, and sentenced
            to death. During the torturously-long appeals process, she was represented
            by San Francisco reporter-newspaperman Ed Montgomery (Simon Oakland),
            and defended by psychologist Carl Palmberg (Theodore Bikel), who
            claimed she was anti-social, but not violent. Her loyal friend Peg
            (Virginia Vincent) also testified on Barbara's behalf. However, her
            verdict could not be overturned ultimately, and she was not able
            to obtain clemency from the governor. After a few last-minute stays
            of execution were exhausted, 31 year-old Graham - who still claimed
            she was innocent, was sent to San Quentin's gas chamber in the late-morning
            of  June 3, 1955. The death scene was memorable. When strapping
            her in a chair, preparing the sulphuric acid chemicals (and cyanide
            pellets), and masking her, the prison guard added: &quot;When
            you hear the pellets drop, count ten. Take a deep breath. It's easier
            that way.&quot; Graham quipped:
          &quot;How do you know?&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              D: John Sturges<br />
          Director John Sturges' adventure-drama was an adaptation
          of  Ernest Hemingway's  short 1952 novel  about a fisherman off
          the coast of Cuba who heroically struggled with a hooked marlin bigger
          than his boat. The opening voice-over narration told about the
              old Cuban fisherman/Narrator - Santiago (Spencer Tracy) - and his
              friendship with young boy Manolin (Felipe Pazos, Jr.), who was
              taught how to fish, but was forbidden to accompany the old man
              fishing because it was considered bad luck. After 84 days of fishing,
          the old Santiago was unable to catch any fish. When  he was ashore,
          the young Manolin idolized Santiago - and Santiago often turned to
          young Manolin for social and physical support; one
              of their topics of discussion was baseball (from newspaper reports),
              specifically the Yankees and Santiago's idol - player Joe DiMaggio.
          Santiago experienced night-time dreams of his younger days, when he
          was in Africa and lively lion cubs played on the beach-shore. In another
          instance, he dreamed about a marathon contest of two
              days of arm-wrestling with a strong black dockworker (Don Blackman)
              in a Casablanca tavern. On his 85th day of fishing, the old, frail
          and often solitary and lonely fisherman finally hooked a giant marlin
          on his line. Aver a period of three days and nights during his agonizing
          struggle with the creature, he tried to land the huge monstrous creature
          as the great fish towed his skiff way out to sea. In the heat of the
          day from the blazing sun in the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic, the old
          man began to suffer fatigue and bloody arthritic hands from the fishline
          - in his contest of wills. He marveled at the fish's size and ability,
          and the sleepless Santiago was finally able to kill the marlin by harpooning
          his prey next to his skiff - and then apologized to it. A group
          of hungry  mako sharks nibbled at the carcass of the marlin lashed
          to the side of his boat, and mutilated it - Santiago was helpless to
          gallantly defend his prized fish against the overwhelming number of
          sharks. By the time he reached the dock with his catch, nothing was
          left but skeletal remains - but it still provided proof of his triumphant
          struggle against nature. As tourists from Havana at a cafe marveled
          at the skeleton, Santiago was back in his shack, &quot;dreaming about
          the lions.&quot;</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Orson Welles<br />
            The themes of director/actor Orson Welles' off-beat, twisted, dark
            and sweaty, film noirish mystery-thriller (considered the last official
            film noir) were  murder, police corruption,
            kidnapping, betrayal, perversion and more.  The film's celebrated
            credits-opening - with a captivating
            continuous-action, spectacular 3-minute and
              30 second tracking and panning crane shot - followed
              a convertible (after a timed explosive dynamite device had been
              placed in its trunk when it was parked in Mexico), as it crossed
            the US/Mexico border into the squalid Mexican-American border town
            of Los Robles (TX). The car was driven
              by wealthy local American businessman involved in construction
            - Rudy Linnekar (Jeffrey Green) who was with his blonde mistress-girlfriend
            Zita (Joi Lansing), a striptease dancer. The car's route was intertwined
            with views of a newly-married couple: self-righteous Mexico City
            narcotics investigator Ramon Miguel &quot;Mike&quot; Vargas (Charlton
            Heston) and his blonde American bride Susan (Janet Leigh) walking
            to the border crossing. As the inter-racial newlyweds kissed, the
            sound of the sudden and violent explosion of the detonated car overlapped
            on the soundtrack, and they turned their faces toward the blast.
            At a low-angled shot, a grotesque, cigar-smoking, candy-chewing,
            obese and bloated local detective Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) first
            appeared as he rolled out of his car at the scene of the car bombing.
			As a narcotics commission expert, Vargas
            became snarled in the local investigation with the racist Quinlan,
            at the behest of Quinlan's loyal partner Police Sgt. Pete Menzies
            (Joseph Calleia), and DA Adair (Ray Collins). Vargas in particular
            suspected that the local Grandi narcotics ring, run by local crime
            boss Uncle Joe Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), was somehow involved. Meanwhile,
            Vargas entirely ignored his young honeymooning bride; in a continuing
            series of sexual terrorization, she was first harrassed in Grandi's
            sleazy, dark motel in town by a peeping tom with a flashlight that
            shone on her as she removed her cashmere sweater. Grandi was interested
            in intimidating Susan to pressure her to have her husband end his
            prosecution of Grandi's drug-dealing brother who was imprisoned and
            awaiting trial in Mexico. While Quinlan was on the Mexican side of
            the border during the case, he visited with cigar-smoking, Mexican
            gypsy and brothel manager Tanya (Marlene Dietrich in a memorable
            cameo), a former lover and <i>femme fatale</i>;
            she engaged in verbal foreplay with Quinlan: (To Quinlan: &quot;I
            didn't recognize you. You should lay off those candy bars....You're
            a mess, honey&quot;).  Then, while Susan was sequestered in
          a room of a deserted, out-of-the-way and remote motel on the outskirts
          of the Texas town (not knowing it was owned by Grandi), she was
          attacked by menacing thugs (also members of the Grandi gang), and had
          to endure the care of the weirdo, nervous and twitchy motel manager/night
            watchman (Dennis Weaver). During this and
          many other past investigations, the experienced,
          old-time cop Quinlan habitually fabricated or planted evidence to convict
          the guilty (even though his instincts were usually correct and he had
          a perfect arrest record). He framed young Mexican shoe clerk Sanchez
          (Victor Millan) who had secretly married Marcia (Joanna Moore), Linnekar's
          daughter. Quinlan had surreptitiously placed two sticks of dynamite
          in a shoe box in Sanchez' apartment - in a long and second unedited
          sequence. (Vargas knew of the deception, putting him into conflict
          with Quinlan.) Behind the scenes, Grandi plotted with Quinlan to destroy
          Vargas professionally and personally by framing Susan for drug use.
          At the motel, Susan was shot up with drugs and then brought back to
          a room in Grandi's downtown hotel, to appear like she had experienced
          a drug overdose.  In addition, Quinlan had chillingly strangled Uncle
          Joe Grandi to death in the hotel room next to a semi-unconscious
          Susan, in an attempt to frame Susan for his murder - and she was arrested.
          As the film wound to its climactic conclusion,
          Sgt. Menzies revealed to Vargas that Quinlan was implicated when
          his cane was found at Grandi's murder scene, and he agreed to
            wear a wire to try and entrap his partner. In
            the gripping climax, Quinlan began to confess his wrong-doings -
            but then realized that Menzies was betraying him and recording him.
            He heard the echo of his own voice as it was recorded on a transmitter
            held by Vargas under a bridge, and realized he had been taped and
            everything about the frame-up had been revealed by his partner Sgt.
            Pete Menzes. Quinlan angrily shot Menzies and
            lethally wounded him. To protect the unarmed Vargas from also being
            shot by Quinlan, Menzies shot Quinlan before dying. The corrupt police
            captain was finally brought down. The final image was of Quinlan
            lying dead and floating whale-like in dark and stagnant gutter-canal
            water and garbage. Vargas was informed that Sanchez had confessed
            to the crime, and was reunited with Susie. Tanya arrived to deliver
            Quinlan's epitaph in the film's final line: &quot;He
              was some kind of a man. What does it matter what you say about
          people?...Adios!&quot;</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
            Director Alfred Hitchcock's perplexing, necrophiliac-tinged
            thriller about obsession was arguably his most
            complex, and most analyzed compelling masterpiece. It involved a
            man's compulsive obsession to exploitatively manipulate and transform
            a woman to match his fantasy. The  dazzling
            credits sequence, with Bernard Herrmann's score, visualized a fragmented
            and shifting image of a woman's blank and expressionless face, followed
            by a close-up view of her eye as the film's title &quot;Vertigo&quot; zoomed
            out slowly from the depths of her widening pupil with spiraling,
            vertiginous, animated designs. In the film's opening chase sequence,
            plain-clothes SF police detective (later identified as John &quot;Scottie&quot; Ferguson
            (James Stewart)) and a uniformed SF policeman (Fred Graham) were
            pursuing a criminal-fugitive. Scottie was left hanging from
              a gutter - frozen by his debilitating fear of heights
            (acrophobia). He also suffered from 'vertigo' as he watched in horror
            as his fellow officer tried to assist him and fell to his death.
            The detective was forced to retire, and was helped to recover
            with his longtime friend and ex-fiancee, Marjorie &quot;Midge&quot; Wood
            (Barbara Bel Geddes), an artist (and fashion illustrator) who was
            in unrequited love with him. Scottie found himself  hired
            by his old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), to trail his
            potentially-suicidal wife as she wandered around San Francisco. His
            first view of the female - a cool, ethereal, lovely and elegant
              blonde named Madeleine (Kim Novak), occurred in Ernie's Restaurant.
            Scottie continued to stalk after Madeleine, and followed her into
            the art gallery at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor where
            he found her hypnotized, motionless and trance-like in front of a
            portrait painting of a woman named Carlotta Valdes, her ancestor's
            portrait.  Madeleine's obsession with her tragic
            ancestor Carlotta Valdez intrigued Scottie. Scottie rescued the suicidal
            Madeleine at the Golden Gate Bridge, when she tore and threw flower
            petals from her Carlotta-like nosegay into the water, and then jumped
            into the cold waters of the Bay. He soon  became
            entranced and bewitched by her, and fell in love with her. During
            a visit together at San Juan Bautista's Spanish Mission about 100 miles south of San Francisco,
            Scottie hoped that  visiting the real-world California
            mission would end Madeleine's nightmares and cure her fears. She
            ran toward the mission's church and bell tower, climbed
            up the bell tower's crude, winding and rickety wooden staircase -
            with Scottie in pursuit, although he was slowed by  his acrophobia
            and vertigo. At the top, she fell to her death
            from the tower in an assumed suicide, and Scottie spiraled down into
            a deep depression. Haunted and obsessed with
            the dead woman, he happened to meet her lower-class double Judy (Novak
            again), a shop-girl. Scottie manipulated, reshaped
            and remade her into the dead Madeleine's image. But then came a striking
            moment when Scottie was attaching a necklace around Judy's neck,
            and he realized that Judy <i>was </i> Madeleine (imagined in a momentary
            flashback of the necklace in the portrait and Madeleine gazing at
            it from a museum bench) -- he suddenly knew there was no Madeleine,
            and that he had been tricked by Elster.  They traveled again
            to the mission, where Scottie asked agonizing questions as he dragged
            Judy into the mission and up the stairs of the mission tower during
            their second visit, to recreate the death scene.  There was another
              terrifying sequence in the bell tower, when she sincerely
            professed that she still loved him even though he had been her victim.  Footsteps
            of a black-clad figure in the shadows startled Judy - she recoiled,
            stepped and fell backwards through an opening in the tower and plummeted
            to her own death (off-screen) in an emotionally-shattering climax.
            The figure was a nun from the mission, who crossed herself and murmured the last words of the
            film: &quot;God have mercy.&quot; In the uncompromising conclusion, a stunned Scottie
            stood on the belfry tower ledge as he stared down at Judy's dead
            body in the tragic ending - Scottie had tragically loved and lost
            the same woman twice.</font></p>        </td>
