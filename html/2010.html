          <p><font size="2"><b>The American (2010, US/UK)</b>, 105 minutes, D: Anton Corbijn<br />
          British author Martin Booth's  1990 novel <i>A Very Private Gentleman</i>          provided
              the basis for this predictable, slow-moving yet 
              suspenseful drama and crime-thriller. The central character was
              a lone American assassin for mercenary hire - with an interest
              in butterflies (serving as a metaphor). In the opening scene, cold-hearted
              contract killer Jack (George Clooney) was under an ambush-attack
              in the idyllic surroundings of Dalama, Sweden by sniper fire -
              his cover blown - and he was forced to kill the armed men hunting
              him and also his own blonde lover Ingrid (Irina Bj&ouml;rklund).
              Weary of his life of murdering people, he retreated to Castel del
              Monte, a small town located in the mountains of Central/Southern
              Italy, where he took the name Edward and posed as a photographer.
              He was warned by his handler Pavel (Johan Leysen) - &quot;No friends!&quot;
              As a firearm craftsman, he was hired to assemble a custom-made,
              compact, rapid-fire rifle (with silencer) for another lethal assassin
              named Mathilde (Thekla Reuten), a mysterious Belgian woman, and
              he expected it to be his last job. At the same time, he befriended
              a prostitute named Clara (Violante Placido) - tempting fate, by
              entering into a loving, romantic relationship in the open with
              her. However, he realized that he was still under the threat of
              being hunted down when he was forced to kill another assassin (Samuli
              Vauramo) from Sweden. He also reached out to the local elderly
              priest Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli), who urged Jack/Edward
              to seek redemption and absolution for his sins by confession. When
              Jack/Edward had completed the gun-assembly and was to deliver it,
              the suspicious Mathilde received orders from Pavel to kill him.
              Sensing that she would attempt to shoot him, he successfully sabotaged
              the rifle so it misfired and exploded back into her face when she
              aimed the rifle at him from a rooftop. Jack gave Mathilde's payment
              envelope with cash to Clara and instructed her to meet up with
              him later. Pavel exchanged gunfire with Jack and was killed. However,
              Jack also realized once he reached a river rendezvous point with
              Clara that he had been lethally shot in the abdomen, and he collapsed
                over the steering wheel and died,
              as a white butterfly took flight.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Black Swan (2010),</strong> 103 minutes,
            D: Darren Aronofsky<br />
            In Darren Aronofsky's great psychological thriller and show-biz drama
            (with some supernatural elements), Natalie Portman won the Best Actress
            Oscar for her portrayal of damaged, fragile, severely repressed and
            sadomasochistic 28 year-old ballerina dancer Nina Sayers. The perfectionist
            Nina was competing for the role of the Swan Queen in an upcoming
            NYC Ballet performance at Lincoln Center of Tchaikovsky's <i>Swan
            Lake</i>. The former prima ballerina and director's lover, Beth Macintyre (Winona
            Ryder), was forced out and to be replaced with someone younger, after
            auditions. The troubled and joyless, but flawless Nina had secured
            the lead role of the virginal and pure White Swan (Odette), but was
            uncertain that she could also adequately perform in the dual role
            as the seductive, visceral and dark Black Swan (Odile). Her manipulative
            and sleazy director/choreographer Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) selected
            her for the role, and tormented her with high expectations. Slowly,
            she underwent a mental breakdown as she began hallucinating, suffering
            at the hands of her smothering, infantilizing, overbearing and resentful
            stage mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), an ex-ballerina herself who
            resented giving up her career for her daughter. They lived together
            in a claustrophobic apartment they shared on the Upper West Side.
            She found a free-spirited, sexually-confident rival in tattooed,
            sexy SF dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), her understudy, but felt semi-threatened.
            There were many signs that the unhinged and agonized dancer didn't
            know the difference between reality and her imagined world. In her
            climactic delusional performance as the Black Swan (which she morphed
            into), she took masochistic self-destruction to the limit, stabbing
            herself in the abdomen with a mirror shard (although she imagined
            herself murdering Lily in a blood-soaked gory scene in her dressing
            room), and dying in the swan song finale as the White Swan - falling
            backwards onto a mattress at the rear of the stage. She admitted
            that she had ultimately found freedom when other cast members and
            Thomas surrounded her and congratulated her (&quot;My
            little princess. I always knew you had it in you&quot;) - although
            they noticed the growing blood stain on her white costume. She had
            attained or fulfilled her tormenting goal of bloodying her innocence,
            of being perfect, as she affirmed in the film's final line:     &quot;I
            felt it. Perfect... It was perfect.&quot; The audience chanted her
            name as the bright lights of the stage obliterated her view - she
          appeared to die. </font></p></td>

            Cianfrance<br />
The major subject of writer/director Derek Cianfrance's downbeat, indie romantic
drama was a dysfunctional working-class marriage. The story told about a married
couple in rural eastern Pennsylvania with a 5-year-old daughter Frances &quot;Frankie&quot;
 (Faith Wladyka), a daddy's girl (who was actually fathered by her mother's past
high-school boyfriend Bobby Ontario (Mike Vogel), during rough sex and a broken
condom). In a series of cross-cutting, non-linear scenes set over a six year
period (covering both the couple's courtship and later dissolution of marriage),
the emotionally-authentic film told of the highs and lows in the troubled, whirlwind
relationship and disintegrating marriage between the two struggling spouses:
Cindy Heller (Michelle Williams), a medical assistant working in a clinic, and
high-school drop-out Dean Pereira (Ryan Gosling), a charming, semi-alcoholic,
blue-collar worker/slacker who was part-time employed as a house painter. Their
initial courtship was very loving, although stresses and strains began to develop
in their marriage, including the issue of Frankie's conception,
Dean's lack of ambition and frequent drinking, their caring for elderly relative
Jerry (John Doman), and the death of their family dog Megan (blamed on Cindy's
negligence) To reconcile with a romantic getaway, they visited the blue-lit &quot;Future
Room&quot; (with a rotating bed) in a couples-oriented themed pleasure hotel
in the Poconos, but the night turned out to be a disaster. After showering naked
together, she rejected Dean's efforts to make love, role-play rape, and his request
to make a baby. The next morning at
Cindy's place of work (where she had just learned of her boss Dr. Feinberg's
(Ben Shenkman) salacious interest in her in exchange for a job advancement),
Dean barged in. The destructive encounter began with a heated argument with Cindy
 that led to Dean's physical assault on Dr. Feinberg, and Cindy's firing from
her job. Plans were immediately
               made for a divorce and a final split between the two, although
          the fate of their marriage was left ambiguous.</font></p>        </td>

            D: Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud<br />
            This was the first of a long-running series of popular, computer-animated
            comedy films. It would be followed by two sequels: <i>Despicable
            Me 2 (2013)</i> and <i>Despicable Me 3 (2017)</i> and a spin-off
            prequel <i>Minions: The Rise of Gru (2021)</i>. The main character
            of all of the installments was evil super-villain Felonious Gru (voice
            of Steve Carell), living in a blackened house-hideout with his elderly,
            weapons-specialist/assistant Dr. Nefario (voice of Russell Brand)
            and his army of Minions. They had already notoriously stolen the
            Times Square JumboTron and the Statue of Liberty. He was jealously
            competing with his younger rival - supervillain Vector/Victor (voice
            of Jason Segel), an arrogant mastermind who had upped the ante by
            taking the Egyptian Great Pyramid of Giza. To outperform and outsmart
            Vector in his next theft, the heist of the Moon, Gru requested that
            Mr. Perkins (voice of Will Arnett), the director of the Bank of Evil,
            finance his new and expensive heist, but Gru was first required to
            steal a powerful shrink ray gun. (It was soon revealed that Perkins
            was Vector's or Victor's father, and he  informed his son about
            Gru's  successful possession of the shrink ray.) After
            the cunning Vector snatched back the shrink ray, the foiled Gru plotted
            to gain access to Vector's fortress to reacquire the ray. He noticed
            three innocent girls from an orphanage: Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove),
             Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and the
            youngest Agnes (voice of Elsie Fisher) who easily entered Vector's
            base. For his grand scheme to work, he decided to take the young
            girls under his adoptive care to be used as pawns. He took
            on a dentist's disguise and selfishly adopted them from orphanage
            head Miss Hattie (voice of Kristen Wiig). The newly-adopted threesome
            began to look upon him as their new father-figure, but he soon became
            very annoyed by their presence, until he found himself enjoying their
            company during a fun day at a theme park. He also commissioned Dr.
            Nefario
            to build robots disguised as cookies and instructed the girls to
            sell them to Vector, in order to steal the shrink ray. Although successful,
            Gru was still denied the bank loan funding, so he had to raise the
            money for his project on his own - with the aid of the three girls
            and the Minions. As the day of the Moon's heist approached, Gru was
            forced to make a choice - would he instead attend the girls' ballet
            recital scheduled on the same day? Although Gru heartlessly decided
            to carry out his plan (with the girls returned to the orphanage by
            Nefario), he was forced to give up his stolen Moon to Vector in order
            to rescue his kidnapped girls, with the help of the Minions. As a
            result, the Moon was launched back into orbit, and Vector became
            trapped there. Some time later, Gru began to melt under the adoring
            love of his three re-adopted girls - his new family of daughters.</font></p>          </td>

            D: David O. Russell<br />
            This sports-oriented  biopic and family drama, about sibling
            rivalry and support both in and out of a boxing ring, was based on
            a true-life story. An HBO documentary film crew was following 40
            year-old, ex-US boxer Dick &quot;Dicky&quot; Eklund, Jr. (Christian Bale) around
            his working-class, inner-city hometown of Lowell, MA in the early
            1990s. He had become a local hero (&quot;The Pride of Lowell&quot;)  many years
            earlier in July of 1978, when he lasted 15 rounds in the ring as
            a welterweight against Sugar Ray Leonard. But currently, Dicky had
            become mostly incapacitated and enmeshed in various criminal activities
            as a crack addict, but he falsely believed that the documentary (later
            seen and titled: &quot;Crack in America&quot;) was about his possible 'comeback'
            as a fighter. To keep the family's boxing legacy alive, he had been
            training his decade-younger half-brother &quot;Irish&quot; Micky
            Ward (Mark Wahlberg) for ten years as an up-and-coming, junior welterweight
            boxer. Unfortunately, the brawling pugilist was regarded
            as an intermediary &quot;stepping-stone&quot; to be beaten by other more aspiring
            boxers on their way to the top. Micky was  being managed by
            his domineering, self-interested bottle-blonde mother Alice Eklund-Ward
            (Melissa Leo), a controlling matriarch who had also managed her favored
            son Dicky years earlier. Although Micky had debuted with an impressive
            career in the 80s, he suffered a very recent serious defeat when
            he had been unwisely pressured by his family's handlers to participate
            in an unfairly-matched bout. He was faced with a life-changing decision
            - should he leave his family behind - causing angry retaliation -
            and train instead with a more competent manager and other serious
            professionals in Las Vegas, NV? With determination, he decided to
            escape the undermining effects of both his self-interested mother
            and unreliable older brother. He received stalwart support from his new
            girlfriend (and future wife) - college athlete-dropout and bartender
            Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), as well as from his father George Ward
            (Jack McGee). With better training, hard work, and  a new business-savvy
            manager Sal Lanano (Frank Renzulli), Micky was able to make a true
            ascendancy and comeback. Before the climactic conclusion,
            Dicky - who was newly-released from prison, reconciled with  
            Charlene and urged the two of them in the fractured family to work
            together for Micky's future success. In the biggest fight of Micky's
            career after being trained again by Dicky, he won the WBU Light Welterweight
            title as a redeemed underdog by defeating the current British light-welterweight
            champion Shea Neary (Anthony Molinari) in an 8-round slugfest in
            the year 2000 in London.</font><font size="2"><br />

            minutes, D: Roman Polanski<br />
          This  taut and increasingly-claustrophobic political thriller
            from director Roman Polanski was about paranoia and power struggles.
          In the opening, a new unnamed ghostwriter or &quot;The Ghost&quot; (Ewan McGregor)
          was hired to help revise the memoirs of retired, semi-disgraced British
          PM Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) who had been forced into foreign exile.
          His previous autobiographer had mysteriously and suspiciously died
          in an alleged drowning accident or suicide. The naive and apolitical
          Brit replacement writer arrived at the site for the writing - the publisher's
          secure, isolated, luxury modernist beach house on Martha's Vineyard
          off the coast of Massachusetts in the town of Old Haven where Lang
          was staying with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams). The 'ghostwriter'
          was to be assisted by Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall), also his mistress.
          Lang was a controversial political figure who was threatened with charges
          of war crimes (the &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; of terror suspects) 
		  and faced possible extradition.
          During his research into Lang, the 'ghostwriter' uncovered a tangled
          web of secrets, conspiracies and lies uncovered by the previous dead
          writer. He learned how the deceased biographer had
            begun to discover the real truth about Lang and his wily wife (the
          power behind the throne). It was entirely possible that the 'ghostwriter's'
          predecessor was killed there because he had discovered a link between
          Lang and the CIA. Evidence revealed that suspicious and shady Harvard
          Law Professor Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson), a nefarious CIA operative
          in the Foreign Resources Division, had been Lang's &quot;handler&quot; for many
          years. In the mind-bending conclusion, Lang was unexpectedly shot dead
          at the local airport by an embittered peace protestor and his memoirs
          were published posthumously. During a book-release party in London,
          the final clues were pieced together - &quot;Lang's wife Ruth
          was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University.&quot; Ruth
          (a CIA operative also under Emmett's control) had nudged her husband
          into politics. In the film's ending, the 'ghostwriter' was run-down
          (off-screen) in the street - murdered like McAra, in order to silence
          him. </font></p>          </td>

          conclude the entire <a href="series-harrypotter.html"><em>Harry

		   <a href="series-harrypotter6.html"><i>Harry
          Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)</i></a>, evil Lord Voldemort
          (Ralph Fiennes) had returned to power with his Death Eaters, and had
          gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Deceased former Hogwarts Headmaster
          Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) had been killed by Severus
          Snape (Alan Rickman) to attain the position of Headmaster and ally
          himself with the Death Eaters. Voldemort told bloodlusting ally 
          Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter): &quot;I must be the
          one to kill Harry Potter,&quot; but that he needed a new wand to
          do the deed. Before his death, Dumbledore had bestowed
          a mission on the student threesome of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)
              (&quot;The Chosen One&quot;), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger
              (Emma Watson) to search for the missing fragments of Voldemort's
              own soul and power, known as Horcruxes that had been extricated
              from his body and distributed. They needed to destroy the Horcruxes
              in order to render Voldemort mortal. After his death, Dumbledore
              had bequested to each of them an item to guide them - a tattered
              copy of a wizard's children's story (to Hermoine), an inventive
              Deluminator homing device (to Ron), and the Quidditch match's golden
              snitch (to Harry). They soon found themselves on the run from Death
              Eaters - in their quest to locate the first Horcrux: Slytherin's
              Locket. They successfully retrieved it from Dolores Umbridge (Imelda
              Staunton) in the Ministry, but then needed to locate the Sword
              of Gryffindor to destroy it. Complications, threats and personal
              disruptions between the three hindered their mission, but they
              were able to destroy the Locket. They soon learned that a symbol
              in Hermione's children's book represented the Deathly Hallows -
              three powerful and magical objects that if brought together could
              make a wizard master of Death. The three objects included: the
              most powerful Elder (Tree) Wand (sought by Voldemort), the Resurrection
              Stone, and the Cloak of Invisibility. Unfortunately,
            they were taken prisoner by Snatchers and Malfoy's sister-in-law
              Bellatrix, and brought to Malfoy Manor. They were rescued by the
              heroic and selfless efforts of Dobby (Toby Jones) who died saving
              them, as the group retreated to Shell Cottage. The film ended with
              a cliffhanger - Voldemort's visit to Albus Dumbledore's
              White Tomb (located near Hogwarts) where he opened the coffin and
              stole the Elder Wand.</font></p>          </td>

            98 minutes, D: Chris Sanders<br />
            This was the first installment of three action-fantasy films in DreamWorks'
            major computer-animated franchise that was semi-based upon children's
            books written and published in 2003 by British author Cressida Cowell.
            It was followed by <i>How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)</i> and <i>How
            to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019)</i>. In the coming-of-age
            story set on a remote mythical Viking island in the village of Berk,
            clever 15 year-old Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III (voice of Jay Baruchel)
            was the son of the village's fearless leader-chieftain Stoick the
            Vast (voice of Gerard Butler), a widower. Hiccup was scrawny, underweight,
            and awkward, and considered a misfit because he was unworthy or unable
            to become a dragon slayer and gain the tribe's acceptance. The tribe
            was often invaded and attacked by fire-breathing dragons who seized
            the livestock and damaged property. On one occasion during a night-time
            raid, Hiccup used his bolas net cannon-launcher invention to snare
            his first dragon - a rare, mysterious Night Fury breed. The dragon
            was injured and brought down deep in the forest, where Hiccup found
            the fallen creature. He decided to secretly befriend the dragon,
            feed it, and name it
            &quot;Toothless&quot; (voice of Randy Thom). He rigged up a harness,
            saddle, and prosthetic wing to enable &quot;Toothless&quot; to become
            his flying mount. Meanwhile, Hiccup's father enrolled him in dragon-training
            school with other teenaged recruits to learn to fight dragons, including
            brash Snotlout Jorgenson (voice of Jonah Hill), quarreling twins
            Ruffnut Thorston (voice of T.J. Miller) and Tuffnut Thorston (voice
            of Kristen Wiig), knowledgeable but timid Fishlegs Ingerman (voice
            of Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and Astrid Hofferson (voice of America
            Ferrera) - Hiccup's future love interest. With &quot;Toothless&quot; as
            his close companion, Hiccup was able to transfer his vast knowledge
            about dragon behavior to the ones that were captive during his training,
            in order to calm and subdue them. His success in training class brought
            him both praise and suspicion. With Astrid, Hiccup learned that the
            dragons that raided the village were actually peace-loving and only
            fought to defend themselves. They had been coerced to attack the
            village in order to feed a giant dragon named the Red Death situated
            in a mountain nest. Hiccup's secret was revealed to his father, who
            disowned him and thought of Hiccup as a dragon-loving traitor. &quot;Toothless&quot; was
            taken captive and led back to the nest by Stoick and other Viking
            warriors, where the gargantuan Red Death counter-attacked. Together
            with his classmates in a flying corps atop the village's captive
            training dragons, now allied, Hiccup flew in to rescue the Vikings
            and to defeat the beastly dragon in battle. Hiccup lost his lower

            Christopher Nolan<br />
             In writer/director Christopher Nolan's
            mind-bending, non-linear, smart and very complex sci-fi heist thriller,
             Leonardo DiCaprio played the part of Dominick &quot;Dom&quot; Cobb,
             a skilled corporate espionage spy and professional thief who often
             performed psychic thefts (or mind-hacking extractions) of corporate
             secrets by invading people's dreams. However, he had become an international
             fugitive and had ruined his own personal life. He
             was tasked with one final, seemingly-impossible &quot;inception&quot; job
             - this time not to steal an idea (&quot;an inception&quot;) but
             to plant one. A wealthy, aging
             Japanese corporate businessman named Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe) hired
             Cobb to plant an idea into the subconscious mind of a rival energy
             corporation competitor, Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the son
             and heir of dying Maurice Fischer (Pete Postlethwaite) and his business
             empire. The idea would be that Robert Fischer - out of his own self-generated
             volition - would choose not to follow in his father's footsteps
             and would break up his corporate energy empire.  If Dom succeeded
             in the task, he would be redeemed. His criminal record as a fugitive
             for the murder of his suicidal wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) would
             be erased - and his family life with his children would be restored.
             To accomplish the dangerous, complicated and daunting task, Dom
             assembled a team of experts, including manager/researcher Arthur
             (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), maze-building architect Ariadne (Ellen Page),
             identity forger Earnes (Tom Hardy) and pharmacologist Yusef (Dileep
             Rao). They were required to create three dreams-within-dreams (or
             dreamscapes) described as mazes. It  was necessary to enter
             very deeply into Fischer's subconscious, possibly to a third dream
             level. At each stage, one member of the team who was creating the
             dream remained behind while the others fell asleep to travel to
             the next level. For Cobb's successful efforts at inception with
             Fischer, Saito made a phone call to clear away Cobb's legal troubles
             with immigration at LAX, enter the US, be freed of his guilt, and
             be reunited with his children - at the film's conclusion. In the
             ambiguous ending,  Cobb tested out his totem (his wife's spinning
             top) to help identify if he was in the dream world or in the real
             world. If it kept spinning around, he was in a dream world. The film ended with an
             abrupt cut to black from the slightly-wobbly spinning top. Had he
             joined his children in the real world?</font></p>          </td>

              D. Jon Favreau<br />
          This action-packed, comic-book sci-fi sequel to the original 2008 film  about
          a super-hero was the third film in <a href="superheroes-marvel.html"><i>Marvel's
          Cinematic Universe</i></a>, and part
          of the franchise-series that began with <i>Iron Man (2008)</i> and
          ended with
          <i>Iron Man 3 (2013)</i>. The previous film ended at a press conference,
          when world
            famous industrialist, inventor, playboy and master engineer Tony
          Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), the CEO of Stark Enterprises, publicly
          admitted to being &quot;Iron
          Man.&quot; Six months later, Stark resisted pressure from the US government,
          specifically from   Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and military
          weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), to reveal and sell his
          Iron Man technologies in his designed suit to be used for the US military.
          Meanwhile, Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the vengeful
          son of dying physicist Anton Vanko (Yevgeni Lazarev) who had worked
          with Tony's visionary father Howard (John Slattery) years earlier to
          create new energy sources, sought to compete with Stark. [Ivan's vengeance
          was in reaction to Howard's accusation that  his father Anton
          was conspiring to sell weapons to the Soviets - leading to Anton's
          arrest for treason, and deportation-imprisonment in Russia.] Vanko's  intention
          was to build his own miniature version of the technology found in Stark's
          arc reactor, and to create his own weaponized suit. At the same time,
          Stark was feeling physical side effects of slow poisoning due to palladium,
          the toxic element in the core of his arc reactor that he was dependent
          upon to keep him alive, while also powering the armor in his suit.
          Feeling depressed about his health, Stark named his assistant business
          partner Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of his company, thereby
          alienating trusted personal friend US Air Force Lt. Col. 'Rhodey' Rhodes
          (Don Cheadle), who began to wrestle with the idea of sharing Stark's
          Iron Man suit with the military. At the Monaco Historic Grand Prix
          where Stark was competing in the race, he was attacked by Vanko, who
          had built his own arc reactor-powered weapon using stolen Stark blueprints.
              In his Mark V armored suit, Stark overcame and defeated Vanko (in
              his own special suit) and had him arrested. Ivan's act of retribution
              spurred Stark's rival weapons manufacturer, Justin Hammer, to break
              Vanko out of prison and build a line of armored suits for drones
              to compete with Stark. Fortuitously, Stark discovered a hidden
              message from his father's old research about a new element that
              could be synthesized and used to replace the palladium, thereby
            ending his dependency and poisoning. In the film's climactic confrontation
            at the 1974 Stark Expo, Stark faced Hammer with Vanko's armored drones,
            and was able to defeat Vanko (who committed suicide) and the Iron
          Man drones with assistance from Rhodes who operated a superhero
          War Machine - his signature armored battlesuit.</font></p>          </td>

            Writer/director Lisa Cholodenko's acclaimed and compelling comic
          romantic drama was about a modern unconventional family, advertised
            with the tagline that referred to  a romantic triangle: &quot;Nic
            and Jules had the perfect family, until they met the man who made
            it all possible.&quot; A same-sex lesbian couple composed of driven,
            controlling, and workaholic obstretrician Dr. Nicole 'Nic' Allgood
             (Annette Bening), and open-minded, eco-conscious landscape-designer
            and housewife Jules (Julianne Moore), lived in Southern California.
            The two were 'married' with two teenaged children (who were half-siblings): Laser
            (Josh Hutcherson) - Jules' 15 year-old son, and Joni (Mia Wasikowska)
            - Nic's 18 year-old daughter named after singer Joni Mitchell. Both
            were fathered by the same unknown sperm donor. It was revealed that
            free-spirited, bohemian life-styled Paul (Mark Ruffalo), the motorcycle-riding
            owner of an organic foods restaurant/farm, was their biological father
            (an anonymous &quot;donor dad&quot;), who
            was soon introduced to the entire family. Inevitably, Jules began
            a lustful affair with Paul when she took on the job of weeding his &quot;fecund&quot; terraced
            backyard. It was devastating for Nic when she learned about the romantic
            betrayal, although their long-running committed relationship survived
            the incident, as Joni went off to college and Laser told Nic that
            his 'parents' were &quot;too

          This R-rated inspiring historical drama and rich character study, a
          Best Picture-winner, followed the true-to-life story of Prince Albert
          (the Duke of York), the son of strict King George V (Michael Gambon)
          who inherited the British throne in 1936, literally on the eve of WWII
          in Europe. His sudden ascension to the UK monarchy and leadership as
          King George VI (Colin Firth) was due to the abdication of his older
          brother David (the Prince of Wales) as King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce),
          so he could  marry American divorcee and socialite Wallis Simpson
          (Eve Best). The new but despairing and insecure King (known to close
          family members as &quot;Bertie&quot;) reluctantly accepted the duties of the
          crown, due to his personal struggles with a life-long affliction and
          disability - stammering. His wife Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter)
          was loving and supportive, and early on realized that he was handicapped
          by nervous anxiety, self-doubts, and emotional outbursts of rage. Even
          before his ascension to the throne, the Duchess knew  that &quot;Bertie&quot;
           was fearful of making radio broadcasts - the main form of communication
          to the people. She sought the counsel of Lionel
          Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an unconventional Australian speech
          and language therapist, who had worked as an elocution coach. Through
          a succession of practice exercises and other unorthodox techniques
          to rid George of his stammer, to gain confidence, and to overcome his
          overwhelming fears, the two men eventually bonded as close friends
          and confidantes. In the film's stirring conclusion, Logue assisted
          King George VI to deliver a flawless speech - his first wartime broadcast
          heard around the world by radio, when the UK declared war on Nazi Germany
          in September of 1939.</font></p>          </td>

            Danny Boyle<br />
            This intense adventure and survival docu-drama was based upon the
            inspiring and remarkable true story of canyoneer-hiker Aron Ralston
            (James Franco), documented in Ralston's own 2004 memoir <i>Between
            a Rock and a Hard Place</i>. With extensive experience in off-road
            areas  in southeastern Utah,
            he was comfortable with outdoor climbing and hiking on his own, often
            without telling anyone of his whereabouts. On a late April weekend
            day in 2003, Aron parked his truck close to an isolated and secluded
            slot canyon known as Blue John Canyon near Moab, UT. Before an accident
            that would change his life, he met two young and lost female hikers,
            Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn), showed them an underground
            cave lake where they went swimming, and helped them reorient themselves.
            Then, in a split second as he climbed down a crevice, he slipped
            on loose rock and found his right hand and wrist pinned, wedged and
            trapped by a large stone boulder against the canyon wall. Over a
            period of five days (the 127 hours referenced in the title), he chipped
            away at the rock and tried various maneuvers to move the rock, to
            no avail. During his ordeal, he became delusional and fantasy-imagined
            and hallucinated events in his past - and in his improbable future,
            but realized that soon enough, without water or food, he would become
            totally exhausted, shut down, and die. He made the extraordinarily
            brave and courageous decision to break his own arm - by applying
            a tourniquet, and then using a cheap Chinese-made multi-tool (with
            a dull knife) to slowly self-mutilate himself by amputation, in order
            to free himself. He was able to stagger back to civilization where
            authorities were alerted and he was helicopter-lifted to a hospital.
            The end-credits showed adventurist Aron years later - married and
            with a son (that he had envisioned) and still climbing, although
            now  leaving behind a note about his destination.</font></p>          </td>

          DreamWorks' computer-animated adventure-fantasy comedy was the fourth
          and last feature film in the franchise-series of  <a href="series-shrek.html"><em>Shrek</em></a> films
          from 2001-2010. It was preceded by <a href="series-shrek.html"><i>Shrek

          and <a href="series-shrek3.html"><i>Shrek the Third (2007)</i></a>.
          There was also a spin-off film, <i>Puss in Boots (2011)</i>. All the <i>Shrek</i> films
          featured the title character - a solitary, often angry, large green
          ogre, who went on various adventures in his fairy-tale world, including
          rescuing a princess. In this final installment, Shrek's (voice of Mike
          Myers) life had become seemingly idyllic and domesticated after marrying
          Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) and having a family of triplets
          about a year old, in Far Far Away land, where he spent time with
          his pals Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (voice of
          Antonio Banderas). Suffering from a mid-life crisis, he began to contemplate
          the old days when he would terrorize the villagers like a real ogre.
          On the day of his childrens' birthday party, he became frustrated,
          morose and drunk and was easily enticed by shrewd, devious, and smooth-talking,
          vengeful magician Rumpelstiltskin (voice of Walt Dohrn) to sign a &quot;Ogre
          For a Day&quot; contract to imagine what it would be like, for one day,
          if he was erased from existence. He had to give up one day from his
          childhood and trade it for the opportunity to become an ogre again.
          He then discovered he had been tricked - he had traded his birth day,
          and therefore would no longer exist after the day was over. He was
          transported to a twisted, metaphysical alternate-universe - a land
          where Shrek didn't exist, where ogres were hunted by flying witches
          and enslaved, where Mr. Stiltskin  was a supreme tyrannical king who
          commanded the witches, and Puss was lazy, semi-obese and retired -
          and Fiona's pet. Shrek had not met Fiona (in ogre-form) - the warrioress
          leader of an underground Resistance movement of warrior-ogres, and
          she was not in love with him. Shrek saved Donkey from slaving for a
          coven of witches and they became companions. Shrek also rescued all
          of the ogres captured by Stiltskin's ogre bounty-hunter Pied Piper
          (voice of Jeremy Steig) by turning himself in, and then teamed up with
          Fiona, Donkey, and Puss to defeat
           Stiltskin. In the conclusion, just before Shrek was about to die
          (vanish) at the end of the day, Fiona kissed him - her &quot;true love's
          kiss&quot; was
          the escape clause that rendered the contract null and void. Shrek was
          returned to the birthday party in progress - now joyfully reunited
          with his family and friends.</font></p>          </td>

            D. David Fincher<br />
          Alan Sorkin's film adaptation was based upon Ben Mezrich's 2009 book <i>The
          Accidental Billionaires</i>, about the chief protagonists who   founded
          and created the social media giant <i>Facebook</i>. The multi-leveled
          drama, told through flashbacks, surveyed how success in revolutionizing
          communication was achieved in the technological age, at the expense
          of both chaotic personal and legal complications. The biopic followed
          the early activities of computer-science genius and super-bright geek
          Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his best friend Eduardo Saverin
          (Andrew Garfield) when they attended Harvard University as sophomores.
          As a means to rate or rank their fellow female classmates as romantic
          prospects, the two created a website first known as <i>Facemash</i>.
           The extreme popularity of the site was noticed by two rich, entrepreneurial
           Harvard seniors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (both played by Armie
           Hammer) and their business partner, who in late 2003 hired Zuckerberg
           to work with the team that was developing a social networking dating
           site specifically for Harvard students, known as <i>Harvard Connection</i>.
           Plans were to expand the site to other schools. However, Zuckerberg
           kept the team leaders at arms-length and in the dark by stalling while
           he simultaneously worked on the launch of his own competing social
           networking site, registered in early 2004 as <i>thefacebook.com</i> and
           launched a month later. The Harvard Connection leaders contested Zuckerberg's
           usurpation, sent him a cease and desist letter, and filed lawsuits
           against him. Soon, the site was extended to include other major universities,
          and then with the financial backing of Napster co-founder Sean Parker
           (Justin Timberlake) who approached  Silicon
           Valley's venture capitalists, <i>thefacebook.com</i> was soon transformed

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Town (2010),</strong> 124 minutes, D:
            Ben Affleck<br />
            Co-scripter, actor and director Ben Affleck's tense crime thriller
            was adapted from Chuck Hogan's bivek novel <i>Prince of Thieves</i> published
            in 2004. The violent heist film was based upon the real-life events
            surrounding the daring daytime robbery of Fenway Park by a crew of
            Boston bank robbers living in Charlestown, MA. The film opened with
            an earlier and smaller heist of  the Cambridge Merchants Bank conducted
            by a team of professional bank robbers, including its long-time leader
            Doug 'Duggie' MacRay (Ben Affleck), his childhood best friend Jimmy
            'Jem' Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), and two other buddies: Albert &quot;Gloansy&quot; MacGloan
            (Slaine/George Carroll), and Desmond &quot;Dez&quot; Elden (Owen
            Burke). Doug was the son of penitentiary-imprisoned Stephen 'Big
            Mac' MacRay (Chris Cooper) who had passed down his criminal profession
            to his son. Although Doug's career goal had been to be a pro hockey
            player, he was sidelined by drug use. During the heist, the assistant
            bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) was abducted, but then
            released unharmed. Doug began to date Claire, who lived in the neighborhood,
            to assure the gang, mostly Jem (who could be identified by a prominent
            &quot;Fighting Irish&quot; tattoo), that Claire wouldn't report or
            identify them to the authorities. Close on their trail was special
            FBI Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm). Although Doug and Claire had established
            a romantic relationship, she broke up with him when she learned he
            was the ringleader of her assailants. However, Doug had hopes that
            after the gang's last heist of Fenway Park, pressured to take place
            by their local Irish mobster connection and money launderer 
			Fergus &quot;Fergie the Florest&quot; Colm
            (Pete Postlethwaite), he would be able to cut ties with his criminal
            past (and possibly reconcile with Claire). During
            the botched heist at Fenway, the gang was surrounded by an FBI Swat
            team, and Dez and Gloansy were killed, while a wounded Jem purposefully
            and suicidally died. Doug escaped unharmed and unnoticed, executed
            Fergus and then attempted to rendezvous with Claire (in the company
			of FBI agents), but a verbal warning clue from her caused him to
			flee. In the conclusion, Claire found the stolen money in a community garden,
			planted there with a note from Doug, who had safely retreated to
			Florida and was presumably waiting for her. Claire used the money
			to finance the renovation of a local hockey rink that she dedicated
			to Doug's mother.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Toy Story 3 (2010),</strong> 103 minutes,
            D: Lee Unkrich<br />
            Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film was the second sequel to the
            original 1995 film, and part of the trilogy of the <i>Toy Story</i> film-franchise
            series. The fantasy comedy again followed the adventures of anthropomorphic
            toys, led by Sheriff Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), a classic cowboy
            doll and spaceman action figure Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen).
            As the story opened, 17 year-old Andy (voice by John Morris) was
            off to college, so his mother (voice of Laurie Metcalf) prepared
            to store his favorite toys - excluding
            Woody (who had survived many yard sales), in
            a trashbag in the attic. The trashbag was mistakenly put out on the
            curb. The toys escaped a dumpster fate, and were encouraged by Jessie
            (voice of Joan Cusack) to hide in a donation box in Andy's mother's
            car, to be delivered to the Sunnyside Daycare Center. There, the
            toys (including Bullseye (voice of Frank Welker), the piggy bank
            Hamm (voice of John Ratzenberger), Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (voices
            of Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Slinky Dog (voice of Blake Clarke),
            and dino Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), as well as Barbie (voice
            of Jodi Benson) who belonged to Andy's sister Molly (voice
            of Bea Miller) were greeted by other toys. The leader was grandfatherly,
            strawberry-scented purple teddy bear Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear or Lotso
            (voice of Ned Beatty), along with his associate Ken
            (voice of Michael Keaton), plus  others. In their new environment
            where they were terrorized by pre-schoolers in the Caterpillar Room,
            the toys realized that Lotso was actually dangerous and in charge
            of the 'toy prison,' and that they definitely had to escape back
            to Andy's home. The toys understood that Woody and Andy hadn't abandoned
            them, but now they were trapped. With ingenious efforts  led by
            Woody, the toys were able to slide down a garbage chute into a dumpster
            that was then transported
            by  garbage truck to a Tri-County landfill where additional dangers
            awaited (a shredder and an incinerator). They were able to ride 
            in another truck back to Andy's house before he left for college.
            All of the toys ended up, with Andy's blessing, in a nearby home
            with a new, grateful and appreciative young owner, Bonnie (voice
            of Emily Hahn). </font></p>          </td>

            Grit (2010)</strong>, 110 minutes, D: Joel and Ethan Coen<br />
          Based upon the 1968 Charles Portis novel, of the same name, and beautifully
          filmed by long-time Coen collaborator and cinematographer Roger Deakins,
          this classic revisionist western was a
          more violent and faithful adaptation with a flashbacked structure.
          It was earlier filmed as a 1969 John Wayne western (with an Oscar-winning
          role). Set first in 1878 at Fort Smith in Arkansas, the main character
          was US federal Marshal Reuben J. &quot;Rooster&quot; Cogburn
          (Jeff Bridges), a  gruff and tough, drunken,
          one-eyed (leather eye-patched) lawman. The film opened with the robbery
          and murder at Fort Smith of 
          farmer Frank Ross by his own hired hand - a cowardly drifter named Tom
          Chaney (Josh Brolin), who then fled west with his fellow 
		  gang-leader/criminal &quot;Lucky&quot; Ned
          Pepper (Barry Pepper). Afterwards, precocious
          and stubborn 14 year-old orphaned Mattie Ross (13 year-old newcomer
          Hailee Steinfeld) was seeking a man with &quot;true grit&quot; to locate
          and capture her father's killer (with her express wishes to execute
          him by hanging in AR). She hired Cogburn. The Marshal was  reluctantly
          allied with cocky and vain Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who was
          also searching for Chaney in the lawless Choctaw Indian Nations territory
          (the present state of Oklahoma), and alternatively wanted to return
          him to Texas for killing a Texas State senator. During the search,
          the headstrong and vengeful Mattie insisted on joining the boozing
          Marshal and often bickered with him. Their search led to a climactic
          shoot-out and the deaths of the two main outlaws: desperado partner Ned
          Pepper was shot by La Boeuf from 400 yards away, while Chaney was killed
          by Mattie herself wielding La Boeuf's rifle. Mattie suffered
          a rattlesnake bite, and was sped on horseback to a doctor by Cogburn,
          but she had to have the arm amputated to avoid gangrene poisoning. The
          film concluded 25 years later, when elderly 40 year-old spinster Mattie
          missed reuniting with Cogburn (a performer in a traveling wild west
          show) who had died only three days earlier. She had his body buried
          in her family cemetery. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Winter's Bone (2010)</b>, 100 minutes, D: Debra
            Granik<br />
          Daniel Woodrell's 2006 novel was the
          basis for the adapted screenplay by director Granik and co-producer
          Anne Rosellini. The grim family drama's  basic plot was about  an Ozark,
          MO teenage girl who set out to find her missing father in order to
          protect her destitute family from eviction. 17 year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer
          Lawrence) was the care-giver for her poor family - mentally ill, catatonic,
          and invalid mother Connie (Valerie Richards), 12 year-old brother Sonny
          (Isaiah Stone), and 6 year-old sister Ashlee (Ashlee Thompson). The
          whereabouts of Jessup, the family's father, had been unknown
          for a few weeks, although he had recently been released on bail after
          being jailed on meth drug-dealing charges. The Dolly home, put up as
          bail, would be repossessed if Jessup didn't show up for his court date
          in a week's time, according to Sheriff Baskin (Garret
          Dillahunt). The persistent Ree set out on a courageous and brave odyssey
          to locate him (like a dog digging for a 'winter's bone'), traveling
          amongst violent, redneck drug-dealers in the backwoods and experiencing
          an unsuccessful attempt to speak to the local patriarch Thump Milton
          (Ronnie Hall) who dealt in meth. On her journeys, she heard rumors
          from her mean, meth-addicted uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes) that her
          father had possibly died in a meth-lab fire, or had fled. Her actions
          endangered her life by her unorthodox questioning of her kin's 'code
          of silence.' When the Dolly house was about to be seized in a week's
          time, Ree was told that she had provide solid proof that Jessup was
          dead, or the bond would be forfeited. Another visit with Teardrop revealed
          that her father had probably been murdered to silence him as an informant
          against the Miltons. Jessup's risky motive to collaborate with the
          Sheriff was to avoid a long prison sentence. Teardrop believed that
          the Sheriff let it be known that Jessup had talked, knowing full well
           that Ree&rsquo;s father would be killed by those he betrayed, and
           also knowing he wouldn't have to fulfill his deal with Jessup. </font><font size="2">In
          the harrowing conclusion, Ree learned of her father's fate. With a
          sack over her head, she was led to her father's corpse (submerged in
          a pond) by three women in the Milton clan, who came to help her. She
          was coaxed and helped into chain-sawing off her father's hands (to
          provide proof of his death to the Sheriff), thereby saving her home.
          Although ambiguous, it appeared that someone in the surrounding clan
          (Teardrop, or a Dolly extended family member, or a Milton clan member,
          or a neighbor) had murdered Jessup. If it was someone other than Teardrop,
          it was implied that Teardrop would then suicidally seek revenge for
          his brother's death.</font></p>
