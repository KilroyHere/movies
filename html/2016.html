          (2016)</b>, 116 minutes, D. Denis Villeneuve<br />
        This thoughtful, suspenseful, and transcendent sci-fi tale was based
        upon Ted Chiang's 1998 short story &quot;Story
        of Your Life&quot; - an exploration of communication with  extra-terrestrial
        life on Earth. The central characters were US Army linguist Louise Banks
        (Amy Adams) and theoretical physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who
        were hired by US Army Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) after news of the
         alien 'invasion.' Their task was to examine and investigate one of
        twelve extra-terrestrial spacecraft that were spread out over the entire
        world. In Montana, the two came into contact inside a space-ship with
        two cephalopod-like, seven-limbed aliens ('heptapods') that were nicknamed
        Abbott &amp; Costello. They sought to translate the strange, palindromic-scripted
        alien language in order to communicate with them. Throughout the film,
        Louise was haunted by the memory of the recent and early death of her
        12 year-old daughter Hannah. Forces seeking war with the aliens (considering
        them a threat) were in competition with Louise and Donnelly who discovered
        that each of the 12 spacecraft had part of a message-puzzle. Ultimately,
        the aliens were revealed to have brought a new &quot;weapon&quot; (re-translated
        as &quot;tool&quot;) - or language that would allow humans
        to have an entirely different perception of time. Those who learned the
        alien language would be able to experience  &quot;memories&quot; of
        future events, and also the past. For Louise, that meant that her visions
        of Hannah were premonitions of her future birth,
        after being fathered by Donnelly.</font></p>        </td>

            D: Anthony and Joe Russo<br />
            The 13th film in the <a href="superheroes-marvel.html"><i>Marvel
            Cinematic Universe (MCU)</i></a>, and the second
            sequel following <i>Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)</i> and <i>Captain
            America: The Winter Soldier (2014)</i>. The film opened with the
            crew of Avengers (led by Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris
            Evans)) in conflict with  heavily armed mercenaries in Lagos,
            Nigeria - resulting in some Wakandan civilian casualties. When the
            group returned home, Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) brought together Natasha Romanoff
            / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), James &quot;Rhodey&quot; Rhodes
            / War Machine (Don Cheadle), Sam Wilson / Falcon
            (Anthony Mackie), Vision (Paul Bettany), and Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet
            Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to sign an international accord. The US Secretary
            of State (Thaddeus &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross (William Hurt)) and
            a global task force, through the United Nations' Sokovia Accords,
            would be assigned the power to limit the Avengers' authority through
            oversight. Although some agreed with Stark about international oversight
             and bureaucratic accountability regarding their activities, Captain
            America vehemently disagreed ideologically - and a split between
            the two factions became evident. An all-out crisis developed when
            King T'Chaka of Wakanda was killed in a Vienna bombing where the
            Accords were to be signed. It was suspected that Captain America's
            old friend Bucky Barnes / the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) was
            responsible for the explosion. The King's son Prince T'Challa (Chadwick
            Boseman), believed it was his duty to seek vengeance and became the
            Black Panther. A &quot;civil war&quot; broke out when Captain America refused
            to rush to judgment and protected Barnes. New allies took sides,
            including Scott Lang / Ant Man (Paul Rudd) and teenaged Peter Parker
            / Spider-Man (Tom Holland). The real Vienna bomber was revealed to
            be international terrorist Helmut Zemo (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) who
            had framed Barnes through brainwashing.</font></p>        </td>

          This fast-paced, action superhero origin story and comedy, in contrast
              to other Marvel superhero sagas, was bloodier, more violent, more
              vulgar and sexier. It was considered  the 8th film
              in the <a href="series-xmen10.html"><i>X-Men film franchise</i></a>.
              Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds), a foul-mouthed, fast-talking, witty ex-Special Ops officer and
              jokester, hired himself out as a mercenary killer. He entered into
              a romantic relationship with ex-prostitute Vanessa (Morena Baccarin)
              and she became his fiancee. After a diagnosis of incurable metastatic
              cancer, Wade accepted an offer to be cured of the cancer by artificially-mutated
              experimenter Francis Freeman / Ajax (Ed Skrein), with an injection
              of a serum in order to awaken his latent mutant genes. However,
              Wade's skin was burned, disfigured and scarred during the torturous
              process in a hyperbaric chamber, although he acquired super-healing
              abilities. He was forced to reinvent himself as the costumed, masked
              antihero vigilante &quot;Deadpool&quot; to seek revenge, and also
              to rescue his beloved Vanessa from Ajax's kidnapping. </font></p>        </td>

          In this intense, anxiety-producing and suspenseful home invasion horror-thriller,
              three desperate Detroit, MI  juvenile delinquent friends:
              social-outcast Money (Daniel Zovatto), his girlfriend Roxanne &quot;Rocky&quot;
              (Jane Levy), and clean-cut Alex (Dylan Minnette) were targeting
              homes in order to burglarize them and then fence off stolen goods
              for profit. The homes they had selected to ransack were those that
              had security systems installed by Alex's father, so that they could
              easily acquire keys and codes. Money suggested that they break
              into a house in a remote and abandoned neighborhood owned by a
              blind, elderly, reclusive Gulf War veteran named Norman Nordstrom
              (Stephen Lang) who was rumored to have a large stash of cash of
              $300,000 (from a legal settlement involving a car accident and
              the death of his daughter). Once they subdued the owner's vicious
              rottweiler dog, they broke through the various locks and security
              devices and entered the house, but were unable to sedate the Blind
              Man (with heightened senses) with a sleeping gas bottle placed
              in his bedroom. Before long, he turned the tables on them in the
              claustrophobic house, ushering in instances of unexpected violence,
              murder and mayhem. Part of the back story of the 'victim' in an
              unusual plot twist revealed that Norman had kidnapped, gagged and
              imprisoned Cindy Roberts (Franciska T&ouml;r&#337;csik),
              the wealthy woman who was the driver that had allegedly killed
              his daughter in the car accident - so that she could be impregnated
              to provide him with a 'replacement' for his daughter. When Cindy
              was accidentally killed during a struggle, he intended to then
              make Rocky his next child-provider, but she was able to overcome

        This poignant, often-edgy, coming-of-age teen romantic drama/comedy,
        set in Portland, OR, followed the growing-up travails of 17 year-old
        Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) - a precocious, awkward, anxious, and self-absorbed
        but strong-minded high school junior living in the suburbs. Four years
        before the present time, she had lost her father Tom (due to a heart
        attack) and was still grieving, along with her now-single mother Mona
        (Kyra Sedgwick). She became horrified when her popular, athletic, impossibly-perfect
        older brother Darian (Blake Jenner) began dating her best (and only)
        childhood friend Krista (Hailey Lu Richardson). Their hook-up caused
        her to feel desperately alone, fragile, unsure and inferior, and after
        ending her friendship with Krista, she turned to others to support her
        including her teacher Mr. Max Bruner (Woody Harrelson), and her affable,

          Verhoeven's audacious French thriller (with considerable sexual content
          and violence) was based upon Philippe Djian's 2012 novel &quot;Oh....&quot;,
          about a businesswoman who was raped and beaten in her home by a masked
          assailant. In the film's opening, video game company CEO Mich&egrave;le
        Leblanc (Isabelle Huppert) was sexually assaulted by a ski-masked intruder,
          but then chose to ignore reporting the attack to police by resuming
          her life. Meanwhile, she was involved in an affair with Robert (Christian
          Berkel), the husband of her best friend and business partner Anne Consigny (Anne Consigny),
          while her semi-estranged son Vincent (Jonas Bloquet) (from her ex-husband
          Charles Berling  (Charles Berling)) was being abused in a horrible
          relationship with his pregnant girlfriend Josie (Alice Isaaz). She
          resented her narcissistic mother Ir&egrave;ne (Judith
          Magre), and was the daughter of an infamous mass murderer who would
          possibly be paroled soon. She chose not to report her own rape to the
          police, wary of them from previous experiences. There were various
          suspects whom she thought might be the assailant, including an employee
          named Kurt (Lucas Prisor). After she found herself stalked and the
          recipient of text-messages, she was attacked a second time in
          her home by the assailant - she learned that the obsessed rapist was
          her neighbor Patrick (Laurent Lafitte). She continued to engage in
          a dangerous and unhealthy role-playing game with him by consenting
          to further rape scenarios, until she finally realized that she must
          report him to the police. As it ended up, during another rape encounter,
          Vincent defended his mother and killed Patrick, leaving her free to
          reconcile with family members and associates. </font></p>      </td>

      Director Richard Linklater's teen sports comedy romp was set in Texas in
      the fall of 1980. The hilarious, witty and nostalgic film centered around
      rowdy  members of a baseball team at Southeast Texas University that
      lived together in a makeshift, off-campus frat house. They included freshman
      pitcher Jake Bradford (Blake Jenner), his southern roommate Billy or &quot;Beuter&quot;

      Quinton Johnson), Kenny Roper (Ryan Guzman), team captain and pro-prospect

      or &quot;Finn&quot; (Glen Powell), another freshman named Tyrone Plummer (Temple
      Baker), aggressive transfer student Jay Niles (Juston Street), and pot-smoking
      Charlie Willoughby (Wyatt Russell). Off the playing field and during the
      few days before the start of the semester, the competitive, dumb athletic
      jocks  sowed their wild oats by crashing parties and carousing together
      at a disco club, a country and western bar, a punk rock concert, and at
      a &quot;costume&quot; party (known as Oz) thrown by theater and dance students, usually
      drinking lots of beer and seeking good times and sex from the &quot;chicks.&quot;

          Based on J.K. Rowling's original story and serving as a prequel to
          the <a href="series-harrypotter.html"><i>Harry Potter film franchise</i></a>,
          this fantasy adventure film spin-off was set in the magical wizarding
          world of New York City in 1926 (seven decades later). Extremist No-Majs
          (a term denoting those unable to use magic, or &quot;no-magic&quot; such as the
          Muggles) were threatening America's magic users, when British author
          Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a Magi-zoologist and author of a Hogwarts
          school textbook that catalogued magical creatures, arrived in the city.
          He was involved in a global study to collect rare magical creatures
          (or 'fantastic beasts') but unfortunately, once he arrived in Manhattan,
          some of the magic creatures in his own leather briefcase escaped. The
          accident occurred because his briefcase was mistakenly switched with
          a similar case belonging to Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a No-Maj cannery
          factory worker (and aspiring baker). At the same time, the Magical
          Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) was investigating
          a series of dark magical events, including a series of terrorist-like
          attacks by Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp in a cameo), an infamous
          dark wizard. The film's plot followed the misadventures of the group
          to retrieve the missing creatures, by Newt, Jacob, smart Porpentina
          &quot;Tina&quot; Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), a disgraced or demoted magical

      Playwright August Wilson's 1983 Pulitzer Prize-winning play was adapted
          to form the basis for this intensely dramatic film. Director/star Denzel
          Washington portrayed demanding, self-loathing and overbearing 53 year-old
          Troy Maxson, a financially-struggling black garbage collector in 1950s
          Pittsburgh. He was facing a crumbling marriage and family due to his
          insufferable bitterness and resentment over having played baseball
          in the Negro Leagues in the late 1930s when the color barrier was yet
          to be broken (it occurred in 1947), and he was barred from becoming
          a pro player in MLB. He had also served 15 years in prison and felt
          stuck in a dead-end working-class job and couldn't make ends meet.
          His longtime friend and neighbor was Jim Bono (Stephen McKinley Henderson),
          a co-worker. He and his loyal and devoted wife of 18 years Rose Lee
          Maxson (Viola Davis) had one son from his current marriage: aspiring
          football player Cory (Jovan Adepo) who had recently been offered a
          college scholarship, and another son from a previous relationship -
          music-minded 34 year-old Lyons (Russell Hornsby). Troy's brain-damaged
          brother Gabriel (Mykelti Williamson) struggled with daily life due
          to mental impairment. Troy continually thwarted Cory's chances to succeed
          in a college football career, and was able to block his son's efforts
          to attend school. The film's title &quot;Fences&quot; (a metaphor for all of
          the boundaries built up) referred to the construction of a fence around
          the family's small backyard that Troy demanded Cory help build. As
          a result of an affair with Alberta, Troy became a father - increasing
          tensions with Rose at home. Although Alberta later died in childbirth,
          Rose agreed to care for the baby Raynell and raise her, but refused
          to welcome Troy back into her life. Six years later after Troy's death
          from a heart attack, the family reluctantly came together to say farewell
          to their flawed and hurtful patriarch. </font></p></td>

        This was the 2nd highest-grossing (domestic) film of 2016. The 17th Pixar/Disney
            computer-animated action-adventure fantasy film served as a sequel
            (or spin-off) to <i>Finding Nemo (2003)</i>. Similar in theme, the
            title character, a blue amnesiac fish named Dory (voice of Ellen
            DeGeneres), attempted to locate and reunite with her long-lost parents
            (Jenny (voice of Diane Keaton) and Charlie (voice of Eugene Levy).
            The childrens'-friendly animation opened a year after the storyline
            of <i>Finding Nemo</i>, where Dory - suffering
            from short-term memory issues - lived on the reef with young
            clown fish Nemo (voice of Hayden Rolence) and his overprotective
            father Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks). With only fragmented and
            flashbacked memories of her childhood, including the phrase &quot;the
            Jewel of Morro Bay, California,&quot; she set out to find her home.
            She was guided on sea currents to California by her friend - sea
            turtle Crush (voice of Andrew Stanton) and his son Squirt (Bennett
            Dammann). Along the way, they encountered some problems and predators,
            including a giant Humboldt squid. Dory was captured by the staff
            of the Monterey Marine Life Institute, a facility that housed and
            cared for many injured or disabled sea creatures. In the aquarium,
            she met many other interesting characters: curmudgeonly red octopus
            Hank (voice of Ed O'Neill) who was missing one tentacle, her childhood
            friend Destiny (voice of Kaitlin Olson) - a near-sighted whale shark,
            and concussion-suffering Bailey (voice of Ty Burrell) - a beluga
            whale. Outside the Institute, Marlin and Nemo (who had hitched a
            ride there with a pair of sea lions and a kooky loon named Becky
            (Gabriel C. Brown)), attempted to rescue Dory. Although Marlin,
            Nemo, and Hank ended up on a truck bound for a Cleveland aquarium,
            and the determined Dory had independently found her parents by following
            a shell trail, Dory (with help from Destiny and Bailey) came to their
            rescue before all the sea creatures returned safely to their reef.</font></p>      </td>

      112 minutes, D: Tate Taylor<br />
      This paranoid, dark and mysterious psychological thriller about domestic
      violence was based upon British author Paula Hawkins' popular, best-selling
      2015 debut novel of the same name. Alcoholic, infertile, unemployed, erratic
      and bitter recent divorc&eacute;e
       Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt), once married to unfaithful husband Tom Watson
      (Justin Theroux), aimlessly commuted by train every day to New York City
      - a route that passed through her old neighborhood, and her old house.
      She was voyeuristically fixated by her ex-husband Tom and his remarriage
      to Anna Boyd (Rebecca Ferguson) with baby Evie. She also noticed a neighboring
      couple: Scott (Luke Evans) and Megan Hipwell (Haley Bennett) (a one-time
      nanny-babysitter for Anna). Soon, Rachel also became obsessed with
      the lives of the second couple, fantasizing that they had a dream-like
      idyllic life. Due to unusual circumstances after she saw Megan kissing
      another strange man (and Rachel was seen bruised and bloody), Rachel became
      involved in a  missing
      person's investigation involving the wife, and was questioned by suspicious
      Detective Riley (Allison Janney). It was revealed that Megan was kissing
      her therapist Dr. Abdic (Edgar Ram&iacute;rez). Megan's husband Scott was
      also considered a suspect since he was known to be high-strung, aggressive
      and abusive. Major revelations were uncovered after Megan was found dead
      (and pregnant) -- Rachel's former husband Tom had been cheating and having
      an affair with Megan, and he killed her when she refused to abort his baby.
      When Tom was confronted, both Anna and Rachel played a role in murdering
      him, and rightly pleaded self-defense.</font></p>      </td>

            by white supremacists. They were met with derision when they unwisely
            played &quot;Nazi Punks F--K Off&quot; by
            the Dead Kennedys. As they fled after their set into the club's backstage
            'green room,' they came upon the aftermath of the brutal murder of
            Emily (Taylor Tunes), a young female skinhead (with a pocket knife
            stuck into her temple). They came face-to-face with the club's owner
            and the scary-looking leader of the skinheads named Darcy Banker
            (Patrick Stewart) - Emily's boyfriend. Darcy ordered them to be held
             hostage, along with the murdered woman's best friend Amber (Imogen
            Poots). It was feared they would report the brutal killing to authorities,
            and they would be eliminated. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensued
            as the band group tried to escape their confined space, leading to
            much gore and brutality (with knives, box cutters, machetes, shotguns,
            and attack dogs) and a high body count.</font></p></td>

            This biopic war film was based upon  the documentary
            <i>The Conscientious Objector (2004)</i>,  telling about the life
            of Desmond Doss - a 7th Day Adventist and conscientious objector
            who became a war hero and received a Medal of Honor for his service
            in World War II. During the war, the American pacifist combat medic
            Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), who had enlisted after the Pearl
            Harbor attack in late 1941,  first endured Army basic training under
            Drill Sergeant Howell (Vince Vaughn) and Captain Jack Glover (Sam
            Worthington). He was mercilessly ridiculed
            for his solid, uncompromising stance on the 6th Commandment 'Thou
            shalt not kill' - and his refusal to train with a weapon or firearm.
            Ultimately, he was arrested for insubordination and jailed. Charges
            were dropped and declared unconstitutional during a court-martial
            trial. Later, Doss proved himself indispensable when deployed to
            the Pacific Theater, where he courageously saved the lives of 75
            soldiers on the battlefields of Okinawa, when his unit was tasked
             with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (&quot;Hacksaw

            D: Ethan and Joel Coen<br />
            The Coen Brothers' madcap and witty comedy presented a comic look
            at the Golden Age of Hollywood and the film industry in 1951,
            when movie studios were known to cover-up any hint of scandal or
            unfavorable gossip about their stars. They regularly employed 'moral
            clauses' in their contracts that were often disregarded, evidenced
            by numerous scandals involving the narcissistic and immoral stars
            and starlets. The film followed 36 hours in the life of slick Capitol
            Pictures studio mogul Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). A major showbiz
            crisis developed over star actor Baird
            Whitlock (George Clooney), who was heading up a sword-and-sandal
            Biblical epic titled &quot;Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ.&quot; He was
            drugged and kidnapped, and the abductors (a group of Communist screenwriters
            known as The Future holding a 'study group' at a seaside estate)
            demanded $100,000 in ransom. As the studio's overworked resident
            fixer, devout Catholic Mannix had already been busy trying to protect
            the reputation of unmarried,
            pregnant aquatic ballet actress DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson)
            (an Esther Williams-type). Now he was deployed to search
            for Whitlock while shielding the devastating news from two snoopy,
            identical-twin gossip columnists Thora Thacker and Thessaly Thacker
            (both played by Tilda Swinton) - a comic take-off on Hedda Hopper

          Mackenzie<br />
      This grim, film noirish western heist drama set in rural West Texas during
      the late 2000s followed the desperate straits of two financially-struggling
      brothers living on an about-to-be-foreclosed ranch/farm after the economic
      recession of 2008. Divorced father Toby Howard (Chris Pine) with two sons
      and high alimony bills, and dim-witted ex-con Tanner Howard (Ben Foster)
      decided to save their endangered, deceased mother's family ranch by engaging
      in local bank robberies of  branches of the Texas Midlands Bank. They
      were pursued and tracked down by near-retirement, aging, small-town Texas
      Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and his stoic deputy partner Alberto
      Parker (Gil Birmingham). During the brothers' final robbery of a branch
      bank, a shoot-out led to Tanner killing two individuals, while Toby was
      wounded in the abdomen. A pursuit of Tanner led to his murder  
      of Parker, who was then shot and killed by Hamilton. Meanwhile, the wounded
      Toby again successfully laundered the stolen loot at a casino,
      and took the converted money (in the form of a check made out to the bank)
       to pay off the family's debt at the bank just in time. He also deeded
      the ranch into a family trust fund (for his ex-wife and kids) to be managed
      by the bank. In the aftermath, Toby was cleared and not suspected of participating
      in the bank robberies, since the bank didn't press continuation of the
      case, and the farm's oil well was producing more income in a month than
      was stolen. However, retired Ranger Hamilton knew better and engaged Toby
      in a non-violent stand-off at the ranch, where Toby explained his motives
      - to break the cycle of poverty his family had endured.</font></p></td>

          <b><font size="2">Hidden Figures (2016)</font></b><font size="2">,
          127 minutes, D: Theodore Melfi</font><br />
          <font size="2">This inspirational biographical drama was the true story
          of three young African-American women in Hampton, VA in the early 1960s,
          a time of continuing segregation and racism, who played various roles
          at NASA during the US space race against the Soviets. However, some
          of the scenes in the feel-good film were fabricated (the smashing of
          a colored bathroom sign, for example), for dramatic effect. The story
          was adapted from the same-named 2016 non-fiction novel by Margot Lee
          Shetterly. Black female mathematicians were known as &quot;colored
          computers&quot;
          who functioned as backup calculators for the all-white male engineers
          at the Langley Research Center. The space race heated up at the facility
          after the launch of Yuri Gagarin in April of 1961 where Katherine
          Goble/Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer),
          and Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon&aacute;e)
           were employed by the West Area Computing Group.  They
          were in a small, segregated group of black women hired to process aeronautic
          data. The film followed each one's experience, although all faced discrimination
           and limited facilities for &quot;coloreds&quot; (restrooms and cafeteria
          services) as well as lack of respect and equal treatment. Katherine's
          potential as a brilliant analytical geometry mathematician was recognized
          by the Space Task Group's (STG) manager Al Harrison (Kevin Costner),
          and although she provided significant breakthroughs in her work there,
          she had to use the &quot;colored&quot; coffee pot, endure a half-mile
          walk to a restroom, and put up with discriminatory bias from her racist
          co-worker/engineer Paul Stafford (Jim Parsons), who took full credit
          for her work. In one of the film's most dramatic scenes, Harrison finally
          realized what Katherine had to endure: &quot;Here at NASA, we all pee
          the same color.&quot;
          In her private life, the widowed Katherine had three young female daughters
          and was courted by a handsome National Guard officer Lt. Col. Jim Johnson
          (Mahershala Ali). In the film's tense conclusion, Katherine's calculations
          helped to guarantee the safety of John Glenn's
          (Glen Powell) historic 1962 orbital mission, although in reality, she
          was not invited into the control room to  watch the Friendship 7
          launch. In a separate plot line, Dorothy Vaughan was appointed to oversee
          all of the &quot;colored computers&quot; under the direction of a curt,
          ungrateful white boss Vivian Mitchell (Kirsten Dunst) who denied her
          a supervisor's title or pay as the supervisor of the Programming Department
          (working with an IBM mainframe computer). And Mary Jackson's hopes
          to become an engineer at NASA, requiring advanced coursework at the
          local all-white HS, forced her to obtain permission to attend the school
          through a court order. </font>

          This dramatic biographical account of First Lady Jacqueline
          &quot;Jackie&quot; Kennedy was a deeply moving portrait of the stoic political
          figure. The account was based upon a <i>Life Magazine</i> interview
          with widowed Jackie conducted by Theodore H. White at the Kennedy family
          compound in Hyannis Port, MA a week after the assassination
          in November 1963. The non-linear film was composed of a series of flashbacks
          delivered by Jackie during an interview with the composite figure of
          The Journalist (Billy Crudup). The events in the film followed what
          happened after the Dallas, TX tragedy on November 22nd, 1963, during an open motorcade ride when
          President John F. Kennedy (Caspar Phillipson) was assassinated next
          to his wife. During the interview, Jackie (Natalie Portman) reflected
          upon her hosting of a White House televised tour in 1962 before the
          topic changed to her immense grief, and the week following the murder.
          She was involved in making plans for the State funeral (and burial
          at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia), preparing to preserve
          JFK's legacy, and taking care of her mourning family members, especially
          her young children. She was comforted by new President Lyndon B. Johnson
          (John Carroll Lynch), his wife and new First Lady Claudia &quot;Lady
          Bird&quot; Johnson (Beth Grant), her life-long close friend and secretary
          Nancy Tuckerman (Greta Gerwig), Catholic priest (John Hurt), and her
          brother-in-law - US Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard),
          among others. Some of Jackie's responses to her grief included insomnia,
          suicidal thoughts, and the use of medications and alcohol. </font></p>      </td>

      Walt Disney's live-action and CGI fantasy-adventure, children's-family

      of stories with animal characters, and Disney's own fully-animated <i>The
      Jungle Book (1967)</i>. The principal character in the film was an orphaned
      human boy named Mowgli (Neel Sethi), raised in the jungles of India by
      adoptive mother Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) in a wolf pack led by the patriarchal
      Akela (Giancarlo Esposito). Although abandoned and a foster child, Mowgli
      was guided by his guardians, including his main mentor and protector Bagheera
      (Ben Kingsley), a black panther. One of the enemies of the wolf pack -
      and particularly of 'man-cub' Mowgli with his human scent, was a threatening
      and fearsome tiger named Shere Khan (Idris Elba), both fire-scarred and
      blind in his left eye. When he grow older, Mowgli decided to protect the
      pack by setting out on a journey of self-discovery in search of a human
      family, while evading the tiger. Fanciful characters during his adventure
      included a hypnosis-inducing python named Kaa (Scarlett Johansson),

      Saroo  Brierley's 2013 non-fictional memoir &quot;A Long Way Home&quot; served as
      the basis for this emotional, tear-jerking biographical drama. The film's
      story was set in Khandwa, India (in central Madhya Pradesh) and opened
      in the year 1986. Impoverished young 5 year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar as boy)
      became separated from his older brother Guddu Khan (Abhishek Bharate) when
      he boarded a freight train that took him more than 1,000 miles away from
      his hometown, to the big city of Calcutta. Bengalese was spoken in the
      new location, so no one understood his desire to return to his hometown
      of &quot;Ganestalay,&quot; and he didn't know his last name. Avoiding becoming a street beggar or
      victim of human traffickers, he entered  an orphanage before being adopted
      by a loving Australian couple: Sue and John Brierley (Nicole Kidman and
      David Wenham) who lived in Hobart, Tasmania. Almost 25 years later, with
      persevering thoughts of his birth family, Saroo Brierley (Dev Patel as
      adult) used Google Earth to help narrow down the location of his hometown
      (and the train station that he knew so well). During his fixated search,
      he neglected his adoptive family and his devoted American classmate/girlfriend
      Lucy (Rooney Mara). In the tear-jerking conclusion, he was ultimately successful
      in finding his long-lost biological mother Kamla Munshi (Priyanka Bose)
      and his sister, but discovered that Guddu was dead (killed by a train the
      same night that they were separated as children). The title of the film
      &quot;Lion&quot; referred to the meaning of his mispronounced name Saroo - or Sheru.</font></p></td>

        Adapted from Jane Austen's late 18th century posthumously-published novel <i>Lady
        Susan</i> composed
        of a series of letters or diary entries, this romantic drama/comedy followed
        the title character's scheming search for suitably wealthy, privileged-class
        husbands to solve her financial difficulties, with considerable gossipy
        discussion about marital partners and sexual cunning. In the late 1790s,
        the flirtatious Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale) - recently widowed
        and still young and beautiful, manipulatively sought to be matched up.
        After discussing her match-making plans with her trusted American friend
        Mrs. Alicia Johnson (Chloe Sevigny), Susan set out to visit her wealthy
        brother-in-law Charles Vernon (Justin Edwards) and his wife Catherine
        Vernon (n&eacute;e DeCourcy) (Emma Greenwell), at their Churchill country estate. 
		One of Lady Susan's first
        conquests was the initially wary courtier Reginald DeCourcy (Xavier Samuel),
        Catherine's impressionable younger brother. After being expelled from
        her boarding school, Lady Susan's 16 year-old daughter Frederica (Morfydd
        Clark) unexpectedly arrived and soon entranced wealthy and foolishly
        clueless Sir James Martin (Tom Bennett), but she feared her mother's
        plans to get rid of her by marrying her off. In the meantime, in London,
        Lady Susan also carried on a continuing affair with married Lord Manwaring.
        In the end, Lady Susan and her daughter switched paramours - Reginald
        married Frederica, and Lady Susan married Sir James. </font></p></td>

        <font size="2">This romantic biographical drama was inspired by  Nancy
            Buirski's documentary titled <i>The Loving Story (2011)</i> about
            the Lovings and their landmark Supreme Court case. In this inspirational,
            social problem film set in 1958, a married interracial
            couple in Caroline County, VA: white bricklayer Richard (Joel Edgerton)
            and 18 year-old Mildred (Jeter) Loving (Ruth Negga) - pregnant -
            were arrested in the middle of the night in their rural home and
            sentenced to prison for violating the state's laws against miscegenation.
            (They had married in Washington, DC where there were no anti-miscegenation
            laws.) To avoid prison time, they were ordered to move away and 
             not return to Virginia together for at least 25 years. Eventually,
            they contested their case and became plaintiffs
          in the  U.S. Supreme Court (the Warren Court) decision <i>Loving v.
          Virginia (1967)</i>, which invalidated state laws prohibiting interracial
            marriage. </font></p>      </td>

          Kenneth Lonergan<br />
      In this insightful, poignant slice-of-life family drama about grief (told
      through numerous flashbacks), after a depressed man's brother died, he
      was entrusted with caring for his teenaged nephew. It told the story of
      apartment housing-complex handyman/janitor Lee Chandler (Casey Affleck),
      a divorced, heavy-drinking, troubled loner whose birth family lived in
      the waterside town of Manchester in Massachusetts. Lee had self-exiled
      himself and moved away after a family tragedy there (involving his involvement
      in the tragic and accidental death of his three children in a house fire)
      to live in Quincy, MA (a suburb of Boston). The anti-social Lee returned
      to his family's home after being notified that his fisherman brother Joe
      (Kyle Chandler) had died of congestive heart failure, when he was told
      that Joe had designated him as legal guardian for his teenaged 16 year-old
      son Patrick (Lucas Hedges), his own nephew. He was also surprised to learn
      that he was appointed the trustee for the estate on Patrick's behalf until
      Patrick came of age. Emotionally-unprepared for these major reponsibilities,
      Lee was forced to stay in Manchester in order to work things out, a difficult
       move for him that brought back repressed and tormented memories about
      his family and the past tragedy that destroyed his life (and led to the
      break-up of his marriage to his now estranged ex-wife Randi (Michelle Williams)). </font></p></td>

          John Musker<br />
          Walt Disney's 56th animated feature film. In this 3D CGI animated,
          coming-of-age adventure film, strong-willed young Moana (voice of Auli'i
          Cravalho), the restless, independent daughter of overprotective Polynesian
          tribal chief Tui (Temuera Morrison),
          set off on a navigational quest from her island homeland of Motunui.
          It was suffering from a blight that was decimating the island. She
          teamed up with a chicken named Heihei (voice of Alan Tudyk) to locate
          a legendary island and retrieve a <i>pounamu</i> stone
          (a mystical relic) that belonged to Te
          Fiti, a goddess worshipped on on the ancient Polynesian island of Motunui.
          The precious artifact had been stolen from her a thousand years earlier
          by legendary, shape-shifting demigod Maui (voice of Dwayne Johnson).
          The return of the jeweled heart to Te Fiti would end an ancient curse
          and restore the island to prosperity and save Moana's people. Once
          she teamed up with Maui, who was eventually convinced to redeem himself
          by returning the heart, they experienced a fabulous journey together,
          exploring fantastic paradisical lands and encountering incredible monstrous
          underwater sea creatures (including a giant coconut crab). Following
          the return of the heart to Te Fiti, the goddess healed the ocean and
          the island's blight, and Moana returned home to be reunited with her
          parents as she became the tribe's new chieftess. </font></p>        </td>

          <font size="2">This dark, supernatural fantasy drama was based upon
          Patrick Ness' 2012 novel of the same name. The emotionally-deep tale
          was  about  artistic, 13 year-old British boy Conor O'Malley (Lewis
          MacDougall) who had a close bond with his terminally-ill, divorced
          mother Elisabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Clayton
          (credited as &quot;Mom&quot;) (Felicity Jones) who was suffering from
          cancer. Plagued by bullying at school from classmate Harry (James Melville)
          and a recurring nightmare, one night at precisely 12:07 am, Conor was
          visited in a startling dream by a gnarly yet wise Monster (voice and
          motion-capture of Liam Neeson) - a colossal, anthropomorphic yew tree
          with thick tree roots. The Monster declared his promise to return and
          tell Conor three gripping morality tales  at the same time
          of night, after which Conor had to tell the Monster a fourth and final
          story. As his mother's condition worsened during the course of the
          film, Conor moved in with his strict and cold &quot;Grandma&quot; - Mrs. Clayton
          (Sigourney Weaver). His secret friendship with the Monster helped Conor
          to imaginatively escape from the difficult and sad realities of his
          life. Conor's fourth truthful tale told to the Monster brought him
          the realization that his mother's death was inevitable, and along with
          his guilt-feelings and grief, he could also expect a sense of comfort
          and relief so that he could move forward from his suffering. </font></p>      </td>

      (2) as teenaged adolescent Chiron (Ashton Sanders), with supportive friendship
      from his long-time childhood friend Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) with whom they

      <p><font size="2"><b>Nocturnal Animals (2016)</b>, 116 minutes, D: Tom
        Ford<br />
      Austin Wright's  1993 novel &quot;Tony and Susan&quot; was the basis for this violent
      and raw crime thriller-drama (and part mystery) about rich and chic female
      art gallery owner Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) in Los Angeles. She  was captivated
      during the reading of a novel's manuscript written by her estranged ex-husband
      Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal), a wanna-be writer from her marriage
      two decades earlier. The about-to-be published novel was titled &quot;Nocturnal
      Animals&quot; - and was dedicated to her (its title was the nickname given to
      her by Sheffield). She became greatly shocked and dismayed by the novel's
      horrifying content when she suspected that the story, a revenge fantasy,
      was inspired by her former marriage to Edward and that she might be in
      jeopardy. Her own current married life was unsatisfactory, unhappy, crumbling
      and in conflict due to her unfaithful and neglectful businessman-husband
      Hutton Morrow's (Armie Hammer) infidelities, and her own feelings of guilt
      and inadequacy. As the film unfolded, so did the pages of the novel that
      were brought to life. The novel's cautionary tale was about a husband named
      Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal), his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their
      daughter India (Ellie Bamber) on a road trip who were assaulted on a West
      Texas highway one evening by a group of hoodlums, led by sadistic, redneck
      ringleader Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Soon after, Laura and India
      were found raped and murdered, and the ghastly story ended lethally and
      violently for everyone involved. To Susan, the story-within-a-story appeared
      emblematic of the disastrous and troubled marriage she had with Edward
      - and her realization that their breakup was somewhat attributable to her
      own cruel deceit.</font></p>      </td>

          Jim Jarmusch<br />
      Jarmusch's meditative, modest comedy-drama told about the everyday life
      of a Paterson, NJ couple: creative poet and city bus driver Paterson (Adam
      Driver) and his committed, stay-at-home girlfriend Laura (Golshifteh Farahani),
      an aspiring country music Nashville star who also dreamed of being a bakery
      shop owner selling cupcakes. The quiet, simple, and subdued film followed
      a typical week in their working-class lives, beginning with a Monday. Their
      minimalist routines were familiar - mostly uneventful work days, some moments
      free to write inspired poetry in a notebook, walking Laura's English bull-dog
      Marvin each night, and a beer with his buddies at Shades Bar. One of Paterson's
      main idols was Puerto Rican-American poet William Carlos Williams (notable
      for his poetic work titled 'Paterson'). A turning point in the film was
      when Marvin destroyed Paterson's notebook of poems when they were away
      attending a Saturday night movie, but Paterson would continue to fill a
      new blank notebook gifted to him by a Japanese tourist. </font></p></td>

        This stand-alone spin-off (and prequel) served as  a &quot;bridge&quot; between
        two previous episodes of the saga. It was set after <a href="series-starwars3.html"><i>Star
        Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)</i></a> - and before the
        events of the first chronologically-released film in the series, <i><a href="series-starwars4.html">Star
        Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)</a></i>. It was intended as the
        first part of a long-running Star Wars anthology series. It was also
        the highest-grossing (domestic) film of 2016. This epic adventure-war
        film (a space opera) told about the efforts of an heroic group of unlikely
        characters who formed a &quot;rogue&quot; Rebel
        Alliance (in the Resistance) and attempted to steal the evil Galactic
        Empire's plans for the  Death Star (a deep-space mobile battle
        station), their ultimate weapon of mass destruction. In the opening,
        the Death Star's Imperial mastermind developer Commander Krennic (Ben
        Mendelsohn) captured the Empire's reluctant head researcher  Galen
        Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) to complete his work. During the confrontation,
        Erso's renegade daughter Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) fled and was rescued
        by  rebel extremist Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). Fifteen years later,
        Rebel Alliance intelligence officer and dashing veteran pilot Cassian
        Andor (Diego Luna), with his reprogrammed, sentient Imperial droid named
        K-2SO (voice of Alan Tudyk), freed Jyn from an Imperial labor camp. They
        became part of a team that had to conduct a risky mission to help find
        Jyn's father (who had information about a vulnerability in the Death
        Star's design). The secret schematic blueprints were located in an Imperial
        data bank on the planet Scarif. Additional squad members 
        included cargo pilot and Imperial defector Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) and
         blind Force believer Chirrut &Icirc;mwe (Donnie Yen). In the exciting
         conclusion, many Alliance members lost their lives in obtaining the
         schematics, but they were able to successfully transmit the plans to
         a fleeing Rebel ship where a CGI-created Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher)

      Scorsese's dramatic and historical religious epic-thriller asked tough
      questions about religious faith in the midst of dark times. It was set
      in the 17th century and based upon Shusaku Endo's 1966 novel of the same
      name. It was about the mission of two young Jesuit priests who traveled
      from Portugal to Edo-era Japan via Macau to locate their missing mentor,
      while continuing to spread Catholic Christianity. During the time period
      of the film, because Christianity was outlawed in Japan by the Tokugawa
      shogunate, Japanese converts to the Christian-Catholic faith were being
      gruesomely tortured and persecuted in order to eliminate them by a merciless
      inquisitor - governor Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata). After receiving word
      that his mentor Father Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o
      Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had renounced his faith and denounced God after being tortured,
      Portuguese Father Sebasti&atilde;o Rodrigues (Andrew

      Both a coming-of-age drama and a romantic musical, this boy-meets-girl
      film - set in 1985 in an inner-city section of Dublin, Ireland - told about
      a teenaged boy who formed a band to impress an enigmatic girl he had just
      met. Shy, guitar-playing Irish 15-year-old teen Conor &quot;Cosmo&quot; Lawlor  (Ferdia
      Walsh-Peelo) was forced to switch to a much rougher public school to save
      money for his upper middle-class family (with a disintegrating marital
      relationship) due to his father Robert's (Aidan Gillen) struggling architectural
      business. At his new school, Conor met beautiful aspiring model, a trend-conscious
      and orphaned Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and he promised her that she could
      star in a music video that his band was producing. Without a band, actually,
      Conor persuaded his friend - budding businessman Darren Mulvey (Ben Carolan)
      to manage a newly-formed band (named Sing Street), and Eamon (Mark McKenna)
      to be the band's multi-talented musician. With help from his stoner brother
      Brendan (Jack Reynor), Conor and the band were soon able to produce their
      first music video with their first original song &quot;The
      Riddle of the Model,&quot; with
      Raphina acting as the star ing&eacute;nue and makeup artist. As their
      romantic relationship blossomed (and fell apart, but then was followed
      by reconciliation), so did Conor's music. By the film's end, the fairy-tale
      romance between Conor and Raphina was strongly cemented as they headed
      off to London to find work. </font></p></td>

          Based on a true story, this exceptional fact-based, biographical docudrama
              was about the &quot;Miracle on the Hudson&quot; emergency water
              landing in January of 2009, when a distressed US Airways plane
              (Flight # 1549) piloted by veteran Capt. Chesley &quot;Sully&quot; Sullenberger
         (Tom Hanks) had no other alternative but to put the plane down in the
        water. The film covered the events that led up to
        the day, when the Airbus A320 was taking off and struck a flock of geese
              at about 2,800 ft., disabling both engines. Miraculously, the heroic
              pilot commandered the plane with his co-pilot, First Officer Jeff
              Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), to gently ditch or touch down (without
              crashing) into the water, thereby saving the lives of all 155 passengers
              and crew on board the aircraft. After the traumatic experience,
              the haunted Sully continued to second-guess his own triumphant
              actions, particularly in the light of the NTSA's investigative
              finding that the plane might have landed at two nearby airports
              (either LaGuardia or Teterboro), according to computer simulations.
              However, after further test runs and simulations, Sully's strong
              belief and insistence that the plane wouldn't have made either
              airport was vindicated.</font></p>        </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>20th Century Women (2016),</b> 118 minutes, D. Mike Mills<br />
        Set in the summer of 1979 in Southern California (Santa Barbara), this
            thought-provoking, off-beat, poignant, coming-of-age dramedy was
            about parenting and a mother-son pairing. It told about the relationship
            between long-divorced single mother, 55-year-old Dorothea Fields
            (Annette Bening) and her 15-year-old high-school student/son Jamie
            Fields (Lucas Jade Zumann). Employed as a boarding-house landlord
            in an old Victorian home, the liberal-minded, previously-hip and
            bohemian-minded Dorothea worked along-side mellow handyman William
            (Billy Crudup), an Earth-child role model, but she decided nonetheless
            to recruit two of her younger female tenants who already knew Jamie, to serve
            as guiding mentors for her mid-adolescent teenaged son who was transitioning
            into adulthood. To help raise Jamie into a good 'feminist man' who
            could sympathize with women, she selected quirky, punkish (magenta-haired),
            24 year-old aspiring photographer and feminist Abbie Porter (Greta
            Gerwig) (with a cancer diagnosis), and her son's childhood best friend
            - 17 year-old blonde Julie Hamlin (Elle Fanning) - a troubled, morose
            and sexually-active teen (but not with Jamie). As Jamie's indoctrination
            and navigation into the world of the late 70s progressed, he struggled
            to make sense of the changing world, as Dorothea (and the other females)
            also realized that there was a completely different, new and foreign
            world on the horizon.</font></p>      </td>

              VVitch: A New England Folktale)</b>, 92 minutes, D: Robert Eggers<br />
        Subtitled &quot;A New England Folktale&quot; and set in the 1630s, this
        intensely-scary, supernatural horror film followed a  devout Puritan
        family who encountered forces of evil in the dark, spooky and secluded
        woods surrounding their farm. The newly-settled family had recently been
        banished (or exiled) from their Puritan Plymouth Colony because of their
        differing religious views, and forced to live on their own in the isolated
        location - under harsh survivalist conditions. Soon after the relocation
        of English settler William (Ralph Ineson) and his large family, including
        his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), and their four young children, a fifth
        male baby was born named Samuel. Shortly later, while being cared for
        by their eldest teenaged daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the unbaptized
        baby was thought to be kidnapped by a witch, and it was implied that
        the baby was killed and the remains were ground up to make an hallucinogenic
        ointment. Following the tragedy, many other ominous things began to
        occur, causing the parents to become increasingly paranoid about a vengeful
        God punishing them.  In particular, they began to fervently believe that
        their daughter Thomasin was possessed by a bewitching spell. They
        turned insanely mad and fearful, suspecting that witching forces from
        the forest were overtaking and terrorizing them, and began to turn on
        each other. One by one, the members of the family perished. By the
        film's conclusion, the parents' earlier dreaded fears had become credible,
        when Thomasin (fully undressed) was lured by the family's billy goat
        Black Phillip (incarnated in human form) into the woods to join a coven
        of naked witches holding a Witches' Sabbath around a bonfire.</font></p>        </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Zootopia (2016)</b>, 108 minutes, D:  Byron Howard
          and Rich Moore<br />
          This 3D, CGI-animated Disney production (with clever social commentary)
          was the studio's 55th animated feature film. In this buddy cop and
          animal story set in urban Zootopia - an enlightened world of anthropomorphic
          mammals (both predator and prey) that peacefully lived together in
          harmony, an unlikely partnership evolved. The pairing was between a
          small-town, rabbit police officer named Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer
          Goodwin) - a spunky new cop (and the first rabbit) in the Zootopian
          police force, and a sly red fox named Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman)
          - known to be a small-time con artist and hustler. At first Judy was
          assigned to boring parking-duty work by African buffalo Chief of Police
          Bogo (voice of Idris Elba). But then, Judy was forced to ask Nick
          to assist her in a case investigation to uncover a criminal plot involving
          14 recent predator (carnivorous) kidnappings, and a possible prey-supremacist
          conspiracy. Things became more threatening in Zootopia when some of
          the missing predators returned with their savage instincts revived,
          causing a rise of racist prejudice amongst the city's herbivores (the
          population's majority).</font></p>      </td>
