          <p><font size="2"><b>Babe (1995, Australia/US), </b>91 minutes, D:
              Chris Noonan<br />
            A charming, delightful and intelligent fairy tale, a comic allegory,
            was based on a kid's book by British author Dick King-Smith, from
            first-time director Chris Noonan. It was followed by a darker, but
            respectable sequel, <em>Babe: Pig in the City (1998).</em> This Australian-made &quot;sleeper&quot;
            was a critical and financial success - a rare family film to earn
            an Academy Award Best Picture nomination (from a total of an amazing
            seven Oscar nominations), utilizing realistic, Oscar-winning computer
            effects (animatronics, puppets and CGI) to portray talking animals
            (including Fly the sheepdog, Ferdinand the duck
                (who thought he was a rooster to spare being eaten), the elderly
                ewe Maa, the trio of singing mice, and of course, the runty,
                orphaned piglet Babe). Despite being aimed at mostly young audiences,
            this film consistently remained intelligent but sometimes quite dark
            for a children's film. The tale was told in storybook fashion (with
          chapters introduced by a trio of singing mice) - about how young pink
          piglet Babe, raised by sheepdogs and daring to be different (and challenging
          his &quot;proper place&quot; in life), learned to herd sheep to avoid
          being killed for human food. One runty
            little piglet who appeared alone and sad was randomly selected
            - to be used for a Lion's Club guessing contest at the local fair.
          Good-hearted farmer Arthur Hoggett (James Cromwell) had the winning
          entry in the fair contest - accurately guessing the piglet's weight.
          He
          brought it to his farm - where the farm animals spoke to the disconsolate
          pig; he was given the name of Babe (Christine Cavanaugh). After a short
          period of adjustment,  the narrator mentioned: &quot;And so it was
          that the pig found his place in the world of the farm. And he was happy
          even in his dreams.&quot; The film's first indication that Babe was capable
            of something beyond his 'pig nature'  was when he sensed that something
              was wrong on the farm - sheep rustlers were stealing Farmer Hoggett's
              sheep and loading them onto a truck. He ran back to the farm and
          alerted Hoggett to the problem. Babe's   
            attempts at sheep-herding improved via coaching from elderly ewe
               Maa (Miriam Flynn) who suggested Babe treat the animals with
          politeness - and they behaved. Babe was further trained in sheep-herding,
              and one day provided  Farmer Hoggett with a timely alert that
              three feral dogs were stealing some of his flock, resulting in
          the death of Maa from the marauding wild dogs. Farmer Hoggett
            first suspected Babe and aimed his double-barreled shotgun at the
            pig, but the Farmer abruptly changed his mind when he heard from
          his wife that other neighbors had also experienced problems with feral
          dogs. In fear, Babe ran away
            and was found the next morning in a cemetery by sheepdog Fly's mate
          Rex (Hugo Weaving). Farmer Hoggett brought Babe home and responded
          to Babe's demoralized state and refusal to eat after hearing that
          humans ate pigs - he fed Babe from a baby bottle. Knowing Babe's ability
          to herd sheep, Farmer Hoggett  signed Babe up for trials in a sheepherding
          competition - the prestigious National Grand Challenge Sheepdog Championships.
          Babe was entered into the competition with the name &quot;PIG.&quot;  At
           first, Babe struggled to control the sheep, and Hoggett was soundly
          ridiculed for using a pig to herd sheep. Babe was saved when sheepdog
          Rex ran back to the farm to get a secret password <i>&quot;Baah Ram
          Ewe. To your breed, your fleece, your clan be true! Sheep be true!&quot; </i>(in
          exchange for promising to treat them better). Once the password was
          relayed to Babe, he was victorious in controlling the sheep to follow
                his commands, and received a perfect score of 100 from all the
            judges. </font><font size="2">In </font><font size="2"> the rousing
            finale, amidst wild applause and cheers from the human audience in
            the grand-stands, the narrator described the tremendous accomplishment:
            (&quot;And so it was,
              that in all the celebration, in all the hubbub of noise and excitement,

              though every single human in the stands or in the commentary
              boxes was at a complete loss for words, the man who in his life

            Writer/director Amy Heckerling's teen-oriented, coming-of-age comedy
            reimagined Jane Austen's 1815 novel <i>Emma</i> set in the contemporary,
            elite 1990s environment of SoCal, specifically the wealthy, consumeristic
          suburb of Beverly Hills. The central character was self-centered,
                ultra-rich, blonde Valley-Girl, 15 year-old sophomore high-schooler
                Cherilyn &quot;Cher&quot; Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) who spoke
                with distinctive lingo, including such slang expressions of the
                time as the PC-correct &quot;hymenally-challenged&quot; 
              (instead of virgin), &quot;as if,&quot; &quot;what-ever,&quot; &quot;surfing
              the crimson wave&quot; (her menstrual period), &quot;Baldwin&quot; 
              (meaning a very handsome male), &quot;Betty&quot; (Cher's term
              for the perfect girl), and &quot;Monet&quot; - (&quot;It's like
              a painting, see? From far away, it's OK, but up close, it's a big
          old mess&quot;). In order to boost her semester grade of C in debate
          class, Cher decided to find a way to make her nerdy
          debate teacher Mr. Wendell Hall (Wallace Shawn) &quot;sublimely happy&quot; so that
              he would raise her grade. She orchestrated match-making
              between him and Ms. Toby Geist (Twink Caplan) (&quot;two lonely
              teachers&quot;)  by writing a forged &quot;Secret Admirer&quot; love letter to Ms. Geist
          and other subterfuge to romantically bring them together. She also
          became acquainted with her own  idealistic, college-aged ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) who
            often visited to avoid his divorced mother and new stepfather. He
          was a socially-conscious, &quot;do-good&quot; environmentalist
            who was planning on going to school in the LA area. His non-materialistic
          values were completely contentious and opposite to Cher's. With her
          best friend Dionne Davenport (Stacey Dash), Cher (who was inspired &quot;to
          do more good deeds&quot;) befriended grungy Tai Frasier (Brittany Murphy),
          a new (and &quot;adorably clueless&quot;) transfer student. She attempted
          to give her a transformative makeover as her next &quot;project.&quot; Unpredictably,
          Tai took a strong interest in  often-tardy, long-haired
          slacker and skateboarder Travis Birkenstock (Breckin Meyer). Meanwhile,
          Cher began to swoon over a fashion-conscious new student named Christian
          Stovitz (Justin Walker), but Cher's
              pairing with him  was doomed when it was revealed that Christian
          lacked sexual interest in Cher because he was gay. One of the film's
          funniest scenes was Cher's driving test with a DMV officer
          (Ron Orbach). After a falling-out with Tai, Cher  began to think
          she had been wrong about everything: (&quot;What did l do? I've created
          some sort of a monster&quot;); she also realized that she was the &quot;clueless&quot; one:
          (&quot;It all boiled down to one inevitable conclusion, I was just
          totally clueless&quot;), and suddenly had an epiphany - she was jealous
          because of her own growing love for Josh, but now felt awkward around
          him.  As the film concluded, Cher discovered an unexpected
          romance with Josh and accompanied him to the wedding of  her two nerdy
          teachers Mr. Hall and Ms. Geist; after the ceremony, Cher was reconciled
          with her girlfriends Dionne and Tai, and was able to kiss Josh  
		  after triumphantly catching the flower bouquet.</font></p></td>

            minutes, D: Stephen Gyllenhaal<i><b><br />
              </b></i>Along the lines of <i>Kramer vs. Kramer (1979)</i>,
            this melodrama was about a vicious custody battle for a boy, and
            inter-racial adoption. Infant Isaiah was found abandoned in a garbage
            trash bin in an alley, deposited there by his African-American
            drug-addicted mother Khaila Richards (Halle Berry). Margaret Lewin
            (Jessica Lange), one of the white social workers at the medical
            hospital where Isaiah was treated, adopted the young boy into her
            family, including her husband Charles (David Strathairn) and sullen,
            pre-teen 11 year-old daughter Hannah (Daisy Eagan). The child,
            due to being a crack baby, had developmental issues, including
            hyperactivity, educational challenges, and emotional problems.
            However, three to four years later, once reformed birth mother
            Khaila had been released from prison (for shoplifting) and had
            freed herself from her cocaine-addiction through rehab, she wanted
            her son back. She was defended by zealous legal aid attorney Kadar
            Lewis (Samuel L. Jackson) on a pro bono basis. To defend themselves,
            the Lewins hired black lawyer Caroline Jones (La Tanya Richardson).
            The lengthy custody hearing-case, held in a Chicago courtroom with
            Judge Silbowitz (Jacqueline Brookes), was summarized in the tagline: &quot;Who
            decides what makes a mother?&quot; Mother Khaila
            testified that she was now qualified to mother Isaiah properly. Cross-examination
              revealed that she had been a prostitute, but had turned a new leaf
              - she had taken a job as a nanny and housekeeper for an affluent
              white couple. A social worker also claimed that Isaiah would be
              better served with a black parent, while another contradicted that
              claim, affirming that it would be detrimental if Isaiah left his
              adoptive parents to whom he was now tightly bonded. Kadar argued
              that &quot;Black babies belong with black mothers.&quot; After
              further questioning, Margaret was forced to admit she hadn't introduced
              Isaiah to any black heritage, culture or black friends, and Charles
              admitted to a damaging secret of being unfaithful. The judge decided
              in favor of the simple-minded Khaila who didn't consider the consequences
              of the return of Isaiah. The transition was difficult for Isaiah,
              and he fought readjusting to a new parent. In the conclusion, Khaila
              contacted Margaret to have the child returned for the time being,
        for the best interests of the child. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><b><font size="2">Murder in the First (1995)</font></b><font size="2">, 122 minutes,
            D: Marc Rocco<br />
           This dramatic thriller, an indictment
            of the American penal system, its prisons and the miscarriage of
            justice, was very loosely based upon (or inspired by) the true case
            of an Alcatraz prisoner named Henri Young in the late 1930s and early
            1940s. Orphaned and destitute teenaged Henri Young (Kevin Bacon)
            was unjustly imprisoned after stealing $5 from a hardware store/post
            office (this was the film's biggest fabrication - Young was actually
            a seasoned bank robber-criminal), and soon sent to San Francisco's
            infamous island, maximum-security prison Alcatraz. In 1938, Young
           and fellow inmate Rufus &quot;Ray&quot; McCain
            (David Michael Sterling) failed in an escape attempt (when fellow
            escapee Ray ratted), and Young was punished with solitary confinement
            in a rat-infested, icy dungeon for 3 years after being slashed
            with a straight razor by the sadistic and vicious associate prison
            warden Milton Glenn (Gary Oldman). Inhumanely treated and almost
            crazy, he received only a half an hour of daylight per year. Almost
            immediately after his release in 1941, Young stabbed and killed
            Rufus with an eating utensil in the neck. He was prosecuted for
            first-degree murder and destined for the gas chamber. He was defended
            by boyish-looking, idealistic, recent Harvard Law School grad James
            Stamphill (Christian Slater), a newbie public defender who had
            no experience in trial cases. Here's where the film's tagline began
            to make sense: &quot;One was condemned. The other was determined.
            Two men whose friendship gave them the will to take on the system.&quot; Young
            was mostly incommunicative and catatonic at first with his crusading
            legal representative. Crusty and stern Judge Clawson (R. Lee Ermey)
            allowed Stamphill's ambitious attempt to put Alcatraz on trial
            for its inhumane treatment of prisoners. It was challenging to convince
            guards or prisoners to testify against the brutal conditions at Alcatraz.
              When Glenn was called to the stand, he couldn't explain why so
              many prisoners became mentally insane during his time as warden.
              Young took the stand and would not agree to plead guilty to the
              charges. He feared returning to Alcatraz and further punishment.
              The jury's verdict was 'involuntary manslaughter' (unintentional
              murder) - and they further called for a full investigation into
              Alcatraz. Warden Glenn was forbidden to work in the US penal system.
              When Young returned to Alcatraz, he was again placed in solitary
        confinement, and found dead about 7 months later in his cell. </font></p>        </td>

            Julianne Moore's collaborations with director Todd Haynes started
            with her first feature-film lead role in his chilling, disturbing
            and provocative tale of a modern-day, environmentally-induced descent
            into madness. She effectively portrayed Carol White, a sexually-unfulfilled,
            affluent, zombie-like, routinely-bored San Fernando Valley housewife
            who became afflicted with a psycho-somatic, debilitating allergy.
            The film continually pondered the main ambiguous issue - was she
            psychologically impaired or physically ill, or both? To be toxic-free
            in a 'safe' personal oasis, the vulnerable, anxious, fragile and
            self-effacing Carol chose to protect herself by retreating from life
            and finding liberation in an expensive, New Age, residential treatment
            center in New Mexico. In the film's final image within her own sterile,
            egg-like, hermetically-sealed igloo 'home,' she addressed her mirror

              In David Fincher's grisly crime thriller, clues  at
            the various murder scenes for each of the Seven Deadly Sins (gluttony,
            greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath) were ingenuously
            displayed, but none of actual crimes were seen committed, except
            for the last one. Even before the opening title credits,  the meticulous
            character of soon-to-retire, weary veteran Det. Lt. William Somerset
            (Morgan Freeman) was introduced after 32 years - he was going about
            his orderly and precise morning routine in his furnished bachelor
            apartment. The wise, perceptive and methodical homicide investigator
            was set in contrast to his headstrong replacement partner, young,
            arrogant, hotshot reckless rookie replacement Detective David Mills
            (Brad Pitt), in their pursuit of a diabolical and sociopathic serial
            killer named John Doe (Kevin Spacey) who had staged murders based
            on the 'seven deadly sins.' T</font><font size="2">he film's best
            acted sequence was a diner scene between Somerset and Mills' unhappy
            relocated wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) who had just moved to the
            city from upstate. She confided in him about her unrevealed pregnancy
            - he advised her that the city was no place for a family, and that
            if she aborted, she shouldn't  tell her husband  that she was
            pregnant. If she went ahead with the delivery, however, he urged: &quot;You
            spoil that kid every chance you get.&quot; In the unforgettable,
            nail-biting, concluding climax, maniacal  killer John Doe  led Detective
            Mills and Somerset to
          a remote desert area marked by power cable towers, promising to reveal
            the last two bodies and give his confession. Instead, he carried
            through with another sick and gruesome crime and souvenir - &quot;her
            pretty head&quot; (a
            severed head, never shown) delivered in a bloody cardboard box exactly
            at 7 pm by a driver who was paid $500. Doe confessed to the sin of
            Envy before killing Mills' pregnant wife Tracy earlier in the day:
            &quot;I tried to play husband. I tried to taste the life of a simple man...It
            didn't work out so I took a souvenir - her pretty head.&quot; The last
            of the Seven Deadly Sins (<i><u>wrath</u></i>)
            was luridly demonstrated   by anguished and angered
            Lt. Mills who vengefully shot Doe in the head, and then emptied his
            gun of five bullets into Doe's body, in exchange for his pregnant
            wife's beheading. After declaring that he wouldn't be quitting after
            all, Det. Somerset delivered the film's final words (in voice-over): &quot;Ernest
            Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting
            for.' I agree with the second part.&quot; </font></p>

                <em>Toy Story (1995)</em> was the first feature length film to
                be completely animated by computers, by pioneering CGI animation
                studio Pixar Studios, which had already experimented with quite
                a few short subject films, most noticeably the Oscar-nominated
                short <em>Luxo Jr. (1986) </em>(whose characters became the basis
                for their logo) and Oscar-winning short <em>Tin Toy (1988)</em>.
                The film's amazing computer effects were surpassed only by the
                intelligent, thoughtful script that had adult themes that both
                parents and their kids could relate to.<em> Toy Story</em> was
                a fantasy in which toys were animated, living beings when humans
                weren't around. Cowboy Woody (voice by Tom Hanks) was the highest
                ranked bedroom toy  because he was the
                favorite of master Andy. (Woody's  companions included Don Rickles
                as Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as Rex a meek dinosaur, Jim
                Varney as Slinky Dog, John Ratzenburger as Hamm the Pig, and
                Annie Potts as Woody's sweetheart Bo Peep). When Andy unwrapped
                 a birthday present and a new hi-tech space and action-toy Buzz
                Lightyear (voice by Tim Allen) appeared, Woody feared that his
                top place had been usurped by the new rival. The deluded Buzz
                believed he was on a mission to save the planet, until the two
                become trapped in the house of Sid, a sadistic bully in the neighborhood,
                and they were forced to overcome their differences.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Usual Suspects (1995),</b> 105 minutes, D:
              Bryan Singer<br />
            Bryan Singer's convoluted, intriguing, darkly comedic film noir 
            (his second feature film) was set in a police interrogation room.
            The non-linear, puzzling film was sometimes a bit too self-consciously
            twisted, clever, and predictable, but still remained a great crime
            thriller. Slow-witted, chatty con-man Roger &quot;Verbal&quot; Kint
            (Kevin Spacey in a breakthrough role) had been offered immunity
            if he talked and provided testimony. He attempted to convince his
            captor, tough U.S. Customs Special Agent federal investigator Dave
            Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) about the enigmatic existence of Keyser
            Soze, a semi-mythical   &quot;devil,&quot;  and almost supernatural
            Hungarian crime lord and mastermind. (Legend had it, according to
            Kint, that Soze was so willfully cold-blooded that when his family
            was threatened with rape and held hostage by Hungarian rivals, he
            killed his own family and then their captors and the rest of the
            mob - and &quot;nobody's
            ever seen him since.&quot;) According to Kint (told in flashback),
            a group of tough and savvy criminals (the ones on all the film's
            posters, in an NYPD line-up hauled in after a Queens, NY truck hijacking),
            including crooked ex-cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), explosives
            specialist Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), entry man and sniper Michael
            McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Latino Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro),
            and Kint himself, pulled off a $3 million robbery of emeralds. Soze
            had also coerced the five thieves to go on a suicide mission to San
            Pedro harbor to commit a huge $91 million cocaine heist -- an act
            of sabotage against one of Keyser's own competitors in the drug trade.
            Verbal insisted that he and his gang dealt with Soze only through
            his legal representative, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who pressured
            them by threatening to kill Keaton's lawyer girlfriend Edie Finneran
            (Suzy Amis) and castrate McManus' young nephew. The weaselly, limping,
            club-footed Kint, a survivor of the explosion at the harbor, confessed
            truths, half-truths, double-crosses, and lies. His recounting, aided
            by the contents of a bulletin board in the interrogation office,
            forced the viewer to deduce what was real and what was fictional
            in the stories he told, and who Soze really was. </font></p></td>
