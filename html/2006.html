          <p><font size="2"><b>Apocalypto (2006),</b> 139 minutes, D: Mel Gibson<br />
            Director / co-writer / producer Mel Gibson's subtitled, R-rated epic
                action-adventure film provided a bloody and brutal portrayal
                of physical abuse experienced during the fall of the barbarous
                Mayan civilization mythically portrayed on-screen. The plot was
                set in the year 1502 in Yucat&aacute;n, Mexico, told through
                the point-of-view of young male Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood),
                an early 16th century MesoAmerican tribal forest hunter. He and
                his fellow peaceful tribal companions in their village were attacked
                and captured by an invasion of a band of fierce Holcane warriors
                led by the vengeful and fierce Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo). Their
                home was ravaged and pillaged and then burned, with many of the
                villagers either raped and/or murdered, while the children were
                left behind. Jaguar Paw's father Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead)
                had his throat slit by the sadistic raider Middle Eye (Gerardo
                Taracena). A few of the young, able-bodied residents, including
                Jaguar Paw, were taken on a dangerous trek to a pestilence-stricken
                Mayan city, to be sold as slaves or sacrificed. The women were
                brutalized or sold as servants, while the males' fate was to
                be sacrificed atop a giant step pyramid - with hearts ripped
                out and heads severed. The urban Mayans believed that more and
                more live ritualistic human sacrifices would appease the gods.
                During a solar eclipse, Jaguar Paw's sacrifice was halted, and
                he was able to escape, although injured, during a brutal game
                of target practice when he was able to kill Zero Wolf's son Cut
                Rock (Ricardo Diaz Mendoza). Jaguar Paw fled during an intense
                chase-pursuit sequence as he was followed by a band of vengeful
                warriors. After killing Middle Eye in one-on-one combat, he heroically
                and determinedly returned to rescue his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia
                Hernandez) and young son Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio B&aacute;ez)
          that he had earlier hidden in a deep but empty cistern pit in the village.
          Again wounded by an arrow in his shoulder, he lured one of the remaining
          warriors, Zero Wolf, into his own animal trap - and impaled him on
          sharp spikes. While the last two pursuers, Monkey Jaw (Carlos Ramos)
          and Ten Peccary (Richard Can), were distracted by the arrival at the
          shoreline of Spanish ships (with Conquistador soldiers and missionaries),
          he was able to help Seven (who had just given birth) and Turtles Run
          out of the cistern. They decided to go deeper into the forest and find &quot;a
          new beginning.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Away From Her (2006, Canada/UK/US)</b>, 110 minutes, D: Sarah Polley<br />
        Director Sarah Polley's directorial debut film was this independent marriage-related
            drama, a poignant and affecting sad tale of Alzheimer's. The
            film's opening scene portrayed the long-term, close relationship
            of 44 years - exemplified by a devoted couple who were cross-country
            skiing in secluded, rural northern Ontario, Canada at their remote
            log cabin by a lake: retired college professor Grant Andersson (Gordon
            Pinsent) and his beloved, increasingly-disoriented, silver-haired
            wife Fiona (Best Actress-nominated 65 year-old Julie Christie). She
            was experiencing dementia due to the ravages of Alzheimer's disease.
            Grant frequently experienced recollections of a younger 18 year-old
            Fiona (Stacey LaBerge) and how she proposed to him. He was taken
            on an introductory tour of the Meadowlake retirement center by its
            chirpy, smooth-talking director Madeleine Montpellier (Wendy Crewson)
            where Fiona was to be taken and cared for. After an initial
            30 days of absence, he was able to steadfastly visit her,  although
            she had lost virtually all memories of him, and had become increasingly
            attached and doting to mute, wheelchair-bound patient Aubrey Bark
            (Michael Murphy). She told her persistent, slightly jealous and bewildered
            visitor Grant who was beginning to feel abandoned: &quot;He
          doesn't confuse me at all.&quot; He wondered if she was possibly  instilling
          in him guilt and 'punishment' for his extra-marital indiscretions
          with students during the early years of their marriage. During a series
          of painful visits, Grant also conversed with sympathetic, friendly
          and plain-spoken nurse Kristy (Kristen Thomson) who offered her pager
          number, and with an understanding punk teenager named Monica (Nina
          Dobrev) who was visiting her grandfather. Grant would often read to
          Fiona from the book &quot;Letters From Iceland.&quot; Over time, Grant
          began to engage in an affair with Aubrey's abrasive, pragmatic and
          outspoken wife Marian (Olympia Dukakis), who had removed Aubrey from
          the home due to financial difficulties. In the
          film's final scene of unconditional love, Fiona briefly remembered
          her husband and his self-less care for her: (&quot;I'm a very lucky
          woman&quot;)  - as the camera spun around the embracing couple to 
		  the tune of K.D. Lang singing Neil

            Gonz&aacute;lez
        I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu<br />
         Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez
        I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's psychological drama was structured
        with three complex, contrived, sometimes-intersecting, non-linear plot
        lines or narratives about four families in four different countries.
        All of them referred to themes of mis-communication, misunderstanding
        and violence. In the first storyline of the ensemble film, a troubled,
        married US couple from San Diego: Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan Jones
        (Cate Blanchett), were on a vacation. They were traveling in N. Africa
        (Morocco) after a traumatic event had seriously depressed the wife -
        the SIDS death of their young son Sam. While traveling on a tourist bus,
        Susan was inadvertently shot in the shoulder. [Note: Goatherder Abdullah's
        young son named Yussef was carelessly shooting a powerful rifle that
        was supposed to be used to scare off predators. Firing wildly into the
        desert, a stray bullet struck Susan. Moroccan police officers, who wrongly
        suspected terrorists, investigated and apprehended the father and his
        two sons after a tense shoot-out that left eldest son Ahmed shot twice
        and lethally injured.] After some effort, Richard was able to seek rustic
        medical help for Susan in a rural village clinic (with a veterinarian),
        and then arranged helicopter transport for her to a hospital in Casablanca.
        Meanwhile, the Jones' had left their two children, Debbie
        (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), back at home in San Diego with
        their Mexican housekeeper Amelia Hern&aacute;ndez (Adriana Barraza).
        Due to their extended stay, Amelia was compelled, without Richard's permission,
        to take the children with her to Tijuana, Mexico so that she could attend
        her eldest son Luis' wedding. Her reckless and headstrong nephew Santiago
        (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) drove them both directions. Upon their return that same night,
        Santiago was drunk and greeted suspiciously by border guards when Amelia
        couldn't produce a parental letter of consent to transport the children.
        He broke through the barrier and sped away. The children were left stranded
        in the desert with Amelia and then abandoned, but fortunately were later
        found unharmed. An illegal immigrant herself, Amelia was faced with deportation
        back to Mexico. In the third story set in Japan, deaf and mostly-mute
        Tokyo high schooler Chieko Wataya (Rinko Kikuchi) was struggling with
        the recent suicidal death of her mother, continued rejection and bullying 
		by male schoolmates regarding her disability,
        and the emotional distance of her widowed father Yasujiro Wataya (K&ocirc;ji
        Yakusho). Confused, frustrated, and rebellious, she sought sexual attention
        from young males by removing her panties and exposing herself under a
        table. When Detective Kenji Mamiya (Satoshi Nikaido) came to question
        her father (regarding his hunting trip to Morocco, thus linking his registered
        gun - given to his guide - to the one used in Susan's shooting), Chieko
        misunderstood the reason for the questioning. She approached Mamiya stark
        naked to seduce him. Her father ultimately realized how deeply troubled
        and unhappy his daughter was, and hugged and comforted her.</font></p>        </td>

                D: Larry Charles<br />
                In this deliberately edgy, R-rated, satirical mockumentary
                comedy, a crude and vulgar character named Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha
                Baron Cohen) feigned ignorance as a &quot;fake&quot; or fictional
                Kazakstani reporter who went on a road-trip to discover America
                and its culture and customs. (Its similar sequel was titled <i>Borat
                Subsequent Moviefilm (2020)</i>). While interviewing various
                unsuspecting individuals on the street and elsewhere (in unscripted
                vignettes), first in NYC, the bumbling and offensive man-child
                Borat, on his hotel's TV, came across an episode of the hit show <i>Baywatch</i>,
                starring Pamela Anderson (as Herself) as C.J. Parker - one of
                the red, tight one-piece swim-suited lifeguards. He then set
                out to Los Angeles, CA on a cross-country journey with
                his hairy, overweight and fat producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian),
                driving in a dilapidated ice-cream truck, to search out the sexy
                actress and propose to her. As part of his schtick, Borat revealed
                his anti-Semitism, misogynistic, racist, and homophobic attitudes.
                One of the more memorable segments was Borat's visit to a South
                Carolina rodeo, where he made jingoistic remarks about the 'war
                on terror,' and was booed while singing his own fictional Kazakhi
                national anthem to the tune of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Another
                memorable encounter was during a dinner party
              at the Magnolia Mansion (on Secession Dr.) with  Southern dining
              society guests,  where he offered
              to show pictures of his family (a totally full-frontal photo of
              his son Huey Lewis, along with detailed commentary about the boy's
              genital growth, and then after visiting the restroom or 's--t-hole',
                he returned with a white bag supposedly holding his own human
                feces. Another hilarious sequence was a
                nude wrestling brawl between Borat and Azamat, first in their
                Houston, Texas hotel room and spilling over into a crowded convention
                ballroom. His encounters included groups such as veteran feminists,
                 Gay Pride supporters,  and Pentecostal
                churchgoers in Phoenix, AZ. After finally arriving in Los Angeles,
                the love-smitten Borat met Pamela Anderson at an Orange County
                DVD signing event in a Virgin Megastore, where he proposed marriage
                to her. Naturally she declined, but he
                wouldn't accept rejection. He responded: &quot;Agreement not
                necessary&quot; and attempted to capture her, Kazakhstan-style, by placing a 'wedding
            sack' over her head to kidnap her. She resisted him and ran off,
            and he was arrested by security guards. </font> </p>

                  (2006, UK)</a>,</b> 144 minutes, D: Martin Campbell <br />
        This action-spy thriller was the third screen adaptation of author Ian
        Fleming's first novel published in 1953 (the first two films included
        a 1954 episode of the CBS-TV series <i>Climax!</i>, and the spy-parody
        film<i> Casino
        Royale (1967</i>)
        with David Niven), and it was the 21st film in the long-running  <a href="series-jamesbond.html"><em>James
        Bond</em></a> franchise-series. It was a successful reboot (and origin
        story) of the series following four Brosnan Bond films (from 1995-2002).
        At the beginning of his career as British 007 MI6 secret agent James
        Bond (Daniel Craig in his debut film), Bond was seen in a parkour
        running foot chase after bombmaker Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) - beginning
        on a crane in Madagascar and proceeding through a slum and ending with
        a shootout at the Nambutu Embassy. He then pursued corrupt Greek official
        and international terrorist henchman Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian)
        and his exotic girlfriend Solange (Caterina Murino) (whom Bond bedded),
        and killed him and his replacement Carlos (Claudio Santamaria) after
        a chase at the Miami, FL airport. Bond thwarted their plans to blow up
        an aircraft. Sent by his superior &quot;M&quot; (Dame
        Judi Dench), Bond's next
        target was the major mastermind behind all of the terrorist activities
        - the scheming, private financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), who was
        bankrolling terrorist clients. He had a bleeding cut over and through
        his left eye. He  had ordered Solange's torture and murder,
        suspecting that she had talked and caused Dimitrios' death. Due to Bond's
        interference, Le Chiffre had acquired significant debts for his allied
        clients, and was desperate to recoup his losses. The bankrupted Le Chiffre
        was scheduled to engage in a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino
        Royale 'Texas Hold 'Em' tournament in Montenegro, with a $10 million
        dollar buy-in entry fee. Bond was supported and partnered with intelligent,
        feisty British Treasury agent/liaison officer Vesper Lynd (Eva Green)
        - a raven-haired, green-eyed beauty, whom &quot;M&quot; had assigned to monitor
        him. The two, posing as a couple, were also allied with MI6 agent Ren&eacute; Mathis
        (Giancarlo Giannini) of the French Deuxi&egrave;me
        Bureau, and assisted by CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright).
        As a result of the game, Bond's objective was to further bankrupt Le
        Chiffre, capture him, and force him to seek British asylum in exchange
        for information to be provided to MI6. After an exciting poker game sequence
        with both sides jockeying for the win (Bond was the eventual winner),
        Le Chiffre kidnapped Vesper and used her to also entrap Bond. (Soon after,
        Mathis was arrested as a traitor that had tipped off Le Chiffre). Bond
         was subjected to naked torture in a chair by whipping his genitals
        with a knotted rope, to reveal the password for the account where the
        poker winnings were allegedly secured. Both were saved by the arrival
        of mysterious Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) who assassinated Le Chiffre.
        Bond resigned from MI6, and although Vesper was personally devoted to
        Bond, she double-crossed him during a holiday spent in Venice, IT together,
        by secretly arranging to turn the undeposited money over to other blackmailing
        thugs. (Her intention as a double-agent was to use the money to free
        her boyfriend being held by Le Chiffre's organization.) After a thrilling
        gunfight, Vesper tried to redeem herself with Bond, but was unable to
        escape from a collapsing (or sinking) building rigged with explosives.
        She drowned as Mr. White absconded with the money in a suitcase. In the
        film's epilogue, Bond had followed White's trail to Lake Como in N. Italy.</font> </p>          </td>

              Cuaron<br />
              Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's sci-fi chase action-thriller, based
              upon P.D. James' 1992 novel, was both a cautionary tale and a dystopic,
              end-of-days road movie. The intense futuristic drama told about
              a chaotic  society (set in London in the year 2027) where
              human fertility and reproduction had become impossible for most
              of the previous two decades. The demise of civilization was signaled
              by the stabbing  death of the planet's youngest inhabitant, 
              Argentinian &quot;Baby&quot; Diego (Juan Gabriel Yacuzzi), at age
              18. The UK was suffering from an influx of asylum seekers and refugees
              who were fleeing from massive chaos and dysfunction in other countries.
              The totalitarian British government had become a  militarized
              police state on the verge of anarchy and collapse, cracking down
              on the wave of illegal immigrants, and paranoid about threats of
              terrorism. The main character was middle-aged, alcoholic, bureaucratic
              civil servant Theodore &quot;Theo&quot; Faron (Clive Owen), a disillusioned
              and cynical ex-peace activist. He had been estranged since 2008
              from his strong-willed, revolutionary activist wife Julian
              Taylor (Julianne Moore), after the death of their infant
              son Dylan during the 2008 flu pandemic. In the meantime, she had
              become the intelligent and practical leader of a guerrilla, underground
              rebel group known as the &quot;Fishes,&quot; interested in protecting
              immigrants and saving the human race. Theo found himself kidnapped
              by the group, and enlisted (for payment) to obtain transit papers
              for a West African refugee named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey). The
              frightened Kee was an eight-months-pregnant, last-known mother-to-be
              refugee. Theo was commissioned to help escort and transport her
              out of London to safety, along with ex-midwife Miriam (Pam Ferris),
              Julian, and driver Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor). Kee was to be taken
              to the southern coast of England to rendezvous with a secretive
              organization known as The Human Project operating from an offshore
              ship known as <i>Tomorrow</i>.
              Filmed with a hand-held, documentary-styled camera and POV angles,
              Theo's caravan was attacked along the way, and Julian was killed.
              The remaining group members fled to a Fishes safe-house, but due
              to suspicious findings Theo learned about the group's nefarious
              intentions, he decided to make a bold move to escape that night.
              Theo, Kee, and Miriam (with a stolen car) relocated to the secluded
              house of his good and trusted friend and off-the-grid drug dealer
              Jasper Palmer (Michael Caine), an aging hippie who enjoyed smoking
              strawberry-flavored weed, and lived with his catatonic wife, Janice
              (Philippa Urquhart). Jasper lost his life providing cover for them
              as the group fled from the turncoat activists - en route by truck
              to a refugee camp in Bexhill. In the film's exciting conclusion,
              after surviving many more obstacles and challenges, including the
              birth of Kee's baby, a lethally-wounded Theo was able to get Kee
              to a rowboat to take her to the rendezvous point with the <i>Tomorrow</i>.
              Before Theo lost consciousness, Kee promised to name her son after
              his son, Dylan.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Departed (2006),</b> 151 minutes, D: Martin
              Scorsese<br />
              Best Director-winning Martin Scorsese's viciously-violent, Best
              Picture thriller-gangster drama  was based on Siu Fai Mak's <i>Infernal
              Affairs (2002, HK)</i>, but with major revisions in the remake.
              The central figure in the tale of murder, betrayal and revenge
              was an Irish-American godfather, a psychopathic gangland mobster
              boss in Boston, MA named Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Costello (Jack
              Nicholson) - based upon notorious real-life gang member Whitey
              Bulger. The depraved mob boss character, only a minor figure in
              the original movie, was extremely volatile, sadistic, and unpredictable.
              The disheveled kingpin casually expressed nasty racial slurs in
              his opening monologue, and completely ruled his turf with his dominating,
              giant presence. The film's central story was  a cat-and-mouse
              game between two <i>doppelgangers</i> (both undercover moles working
              against each other in opposing gangs). Costello's
              gang was being infiltrated by undercover Boston policeman William
              &quot;Billy&quot; Costigan Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who had been
              recruited by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam
              (Mark Wahlberg). At the same time, corrupt Boston detective
              Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a Massachusetts State Trooper, who
              had been raised by Costello since childhood, was working for him
              as an undercover mole in the Special Investigations Unit. A third
              informant was Trooper Barrigan (James Badge Dale) (a second mole
              in the police force who was on Costello's payroll). Costello's
              gang was involved in the theft of computer microprocessors, destined
              to be sold to a Chinese gang representing the Chinese government.
              One of the film's sub-plots was that police psychiatrist Madolyn
              Murray (Vera Farmiga) was dating both Costigan and Sullivan, and
              was pregnant by either one of them. She was living with Sullivan
              and secretly engaged to him. In the concluding bloody denouement,
              almost all of the leading big-name cast members were killed (mostly
              by a single-gunblast to the head), often abruptly. Captain Queenan
              was thrown over the side of a six-story warehouse building. Costello
              was shot a few times in the chest by Colin Sullivan during a botched
              cocaine-deal in Sheffield. Billy Costigan was killed by Trooper
              Barrigan as he emerged from an elevator. Barrigan was shot dead
              by Sullivan, and Sullivan was shot, as he entered his Beacon Hill
              apartment, by Queenan's assistant Sgt. Dignam.</font></p>          </td>

              perfectionist and haughty Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). The
              main assistant to the dictatorial and ruthless head dominatrix,
              an icy super-diva with high standards and endless demands, was
              Andy's unpleasant and condescending boss Emily Charlton (Emily
              Blunt). Andy's main hectic responsibilities were as a 'go-to' gopher
              - her primary jobs consisted of delivering coffee, answering phones,
              running personal errands, and picking up various outfits from designers
              about town. At first, Miranda made personally cruel judgments about
              Andy's body size (size 6) and lack of fashion sense. In order to
              please her boss and fit in, eager-to-please Andy - with help from
              gay art director Nigel Kipling (Stanley Tucci), received a stylish
              makeover and tossed away her frumpy clothes. Meanwhile, she neglected
              and ignored her close friends and private life with her scruffy
              live-in boyfriend Nate Cooper (Adrian Grenier), a chef, and best
              friend Lily (Tracie Thoms), an aspiring photographer. She found
              herself being seduced by a young, cynical but attractive writer
              named Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), working for <i>New York</i> magazine.
              Due to unforseen circumstances, Andy was able to replace Emily
              as Miranda's main assistant during Spring Fashion Week in Paris.
              She was set to leave the night after she broke up with Nate. Shifting
              positions and backstage intrigue helped to open Andy's eyes to
              Miranda's merciless manipulations and cold backstabbing involving
              her mentor Nigel. Repulsed and finally understanding how corporate and shallow she had become, Andy impulsively quit to
              be true to herself and retain her integrity. She realized she had
              been seduced by all the glamour and compromised, distorted values
              of the fashion industry. Back in NYC, Andy was able to reconcile
              her relationship with Nate, with the possibility of a long-term
              relationship with him since he had taken a job as a sous-chef in
              a popular Boston restaurant. At the same time, Andy accepted a
              job to work at a major New York publication company, with a personal
              reference from Miranda herself.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Dreamgirls (2006),</b> 130 minutes, D: Bill Condon<br />
            Director Bill Condon's musical drama was a film adaptation of  
          the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name. The show-biz musical was
                based upon the 1960s-1970s singing group The Supremes (headed
                by Diana Ross) - and the breakthrough, Michigan-based Motown
                record label. The story was told through the eyes of a Detroit
                singing group known as the Dreamettes (or Dreams). The film's
                opening was set at a local 1962 amateur talent show contest where
                the three-person girl-group known as the Dreamettes -- lead singer
                Effie White (Jennifer Hudson), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose),
                and Deena Jones (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) --  were appearing. 
				Ruthlessly ambitious, slick and manipulative
                car salesman-hustler Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) 'discovered'
                them, and gave them a chance to sing back-up with past-his-prime
                singer James (Jimmy) &quot;Thunder&quot; Early
                (Eddie Murphy), a James Brown or Marvin Gaye-like R&amp;B performer.
                During the group's short association with Jimmy,  Lorrell was
                engaged in an adulterous affair with him as his mistress. As
                the Dreamettes' stardom rose, the scheming and over-controlling
                Taylor became the executive of his own record label, Rainbow
                Records, and promoted the group's potential as a stand-alone,
                cross-over group to become mainstream (or &quot;white&quot;) pop stars.
                While in a relationship with Effie, wheeler-dealer Curtis decided
                to replace plus-sized Effie as the ultra-talented lead singer
                with the slimmer, more conventional and marketable Deena, and
                renamed the group &quot;The Dreams.&quot; [Note: Deena's character 
				was based upon Motown star
                Diana Ross.] The change in the group's dynamics and relationships,
                although the group had became wildly popular, was also affected
                by Curtis' transfer of his affections to Deena (who ultimately
                became his wife), and his eventual dropping of Effie from the
                group altogether. In 1966, he replaced her with his  
                secretary Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal), who began dating Effie's
                brother, Clarence Conrad (C.C.) White (Keith Robinson), the group's
                head song-writer. In the mid-1970s, Curtis dropped drug-abusing
                Jimmy from the record label, and Lorrell ended her affair, followed
                shortly by Jimmy's death from a drug-overdose. Meanwhile,
                Effie had sunk into poverty as a welfare mother in Detroit while
                raising her daughter Magic (Mariah I. Wilson), a child fathered
                by Curtis. With assistance from Jimmy's
                ex-manager Marty Madison (Danny Glover) and from song-writer C.C.
                who was disgusted and had quit working for Curtis, Effie began
                to resurrect her career by performing in clubs and releasing
                a comeback single. Effie also reconciled with Deena in Los Angeles
                after evidence of her husband Curtis' payola schemes were discovered,
                and Curtis was forced to promote Effie's record nationally. By
                1975, Deena had left the Dreams, but they came together for their
                last and final performance (with Effie joining them).</font></p>          </td>

              D: Clint Eastwood<br />
        Director Clint Eastwood's war-drama was the film adaptation of the 2000
        non-fiction book &quot;Flags of Our Fathers,&quot; that told some of the life experiences
         of the six soldiers (five Marines and one Navy Corpsman) at the 1945
        Battle of Iwo Jima during WWII, when the group heroically raised the
        US flag on Mount Suribachi (seen in the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo
        by Joe Rosenthal) on February 23, 1945. Eastwood's companion film, <i>Letters
        From Iwo Jima (2006)</i>, in Japanese with subtitles, was told from the
        Japanese POV, whereas this film, told with flashbacks (of battle scenes)
        and interviews, was from the American POV. At the end of March in 1945,
        a month after the flag-raising, the battle over Iwo Jima island in the
        Pacific ended, with the US the victor but the overall war was still
        not completed. Three traumatized, surviving flag-raisers -- Marine Private
        First Class Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) - an alcoholic Native-American, Marine
        Private First Class Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), and Navy Pharmacist's
        Mate 2nd Class John &quot;Doc&quot; Bradley
        (Ryan Phillippe) -- were given a hero's welcome when brought home. They
        were commissioned by the US government on a war-bond drive and good-will
        tour throughout the country. After numerous instances of re-enacting
        the famous pose on the Mount (with discrepancies about who was depicted
        in the photo and other battlefront inaccuracies), and being asked repetitive
        questions by the press and forced to relive their combat, the trio of
        survivors were guilt-ridden over the undeserved attention. Part of the
        film's story was portrayed as a flashback to 1945, as &quot;Doc&quot; on his death-bed
        told his war-time experiences to his grown-son James Bradley (Tom McCarthy). </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Happy Feet (2006),</b> 108 minutes, D: George Miller<br />
            Director George Miller's rollicking, poignant song-and-dance CGI
        animated musical (with some elements of adventure) was the Best Animated
                Feature Film of the year. It was set amongst Emperor Penguins
                in Antarctica. In the family-children friendly film's opening,
                a chick named Mambo (voice of Elijah Wood) was born to Elvis
                Presley-like Memphis (voice of Hugh Jackman) and breathy Marilyn
                Monroe-like Norma Jean (voice of Nicole Kidman). Mambo was a
                blue-eyed, golden-beaked baby penguin chick with &quot;happy
                feet.&quot;
                Later, Mambo would be named Mumble by his peers due to his inability
                to sing, and also nicknamed 'Happyfeet' by the disgusted elders.
                Mumble's teacher Miss Viola (voice of Magda Szubanski) discovered
                that he did not have a heartsong: (&quot;A penguin without a
                heartsong is hardly a penguin at all&quot;)
                - a romantic song that would attract a soulmate, but he had
        		a unique talent as a tap dancer. Mumble successfully courted
                Gloria (voice of Brittany Murphy) with his dancing, and argued
                with the elders led by Noah the Elder (voice of Hugo Weaving),
                when they wanted him to be ostracized. They feared that his 'happy
                feet' were responsible for famine, and they exiled him for his
                forbidden dancing. Mumble went on a brave trek to discover the &quot;aliens&quot; -
                the true cause  for the severe fish shortage. In
                a heart-wrenching scene, the captured Mumble, now living a nightmarish
                life in a big-city Marine World aquarium in Australia, performed
                a soft-shoe routine for a little girl (a biped &quot;alien&quot;)
                on the other side of the display glass, and drew a crowd's attention.
                The awe-inspiring incident caused him to be  set free, and let
                back into the wild while wearing a tracking device. In the joyous
                finale-conclusion, the human scientist aliens who followed Mumble
                back to his habitat witnessed the penguins' mass dancing - Mumble
                had convinced the other penguins to join in a communal dance
                to communicate with the arriving 'aliens' (humans), resulting
                in the creatures being saved from starvation and hunting by a
                United Nations decree that banned all future Antarctic fishing.</font></p>        </td>

              Burger<br />
              Writer/director Neil Burger's romantic and supernatural murder
              mystery/drama was not to be confused with the PG-rated, animated
              film <i>The Illusionist (2010, Fr.)</i>. The dazzling and glowing
              period melodrama (and fairy-tale romance) was loosely adapted from
              the story <i>Eisenheim
              the Illusionist</i>, by Steven Millhauser - about the turn-of-the-century
              Viennese magician/wizard. Told with narrated, voice-over flashbacks,
              dogged and determined Chief Police
              Inspector Walter Uhl (Paul Giamatti) described why he was arresting
              talented stage performer Eisenheim  (aka Eduard
              Abramovich) (Edward Norton) for necromancy
              in 1889. The film looked back to follow the long-lasting love affair
              between childhood friends who were in different social classes
              -- the lower-class magician Eisenheim (Aaron Johnson as youth)
              and Sophie (Eleanor Tomlinson as youth), the future Duchess von
              Teschen (Jessica Biel as adult). They were forcibly and cruelly
              separated and didn't see each other until 15 years later, when
              she was engaged to marry Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) who
              was planning to usurp the Austrian-Hungarian throne from his elderly
              father, the Emperor Franz Joseph I. The two forbidden lovers reignited
              their love for each other during a secret love-making rendezvous
              - and then the Duchess appeared to be murdered by stabbing. Her
              lifeless body was later found in a stream, and the Prince was suspected
              of the crime. Magician Eisenheim's newest illusionist stage-show
              featured summoning ghosts, including Sophie who was conjured up.
              She seemed to accuse the Prince of the crime of her bloody murder.
              The flashback ended when Uhl went to arrest Eisenheim on-stage
              under the Prince's orders. Eisenheim escaped when his spirit also
              faded and vanished. Uhl was led to evidence in the horse stables
              linking the Prince to the murder, and when accused, he committed
              suicide by shooting himself in the head. The film's denouement
              found Uhl suddenly realizing that Sophie's death had been a complete
              and deceptive frameup, to release her from Prince Leopold's grasp,
              and to implicate Leopold. Eisenheim and Sophie were reunited to
               start a new life together in a cabin at a beautiful mountain.
              The film's last line was the Illusionist's voice heard in the Inspector's
              memory: &quot;Everything you've seen is an illusion, it's a trick.&quot; </font></p>        </td>

              This  harrowing, thought-provoking, and earnest fact-based Best
              Documentary Feature Academy Award winner was about the twin threats
              of global warming and environmental pollution. (It was followed
              by a sequel:  <i>An Inconvenient Sequel:
              Truth to Power (2017)</i>.) The social-issues conversation was
              hosted by former Vice President Al Gore (as Himself), now posing
              as an environmental activist, whose opening line was: &quot;I used to
              be the next President of the United States of America.&quot; With a
              masterful use of slides, animations, computer graphs and 'nature'
              photos, he delivered a multimedia lecture that he had delivered
              in-person hundreds of times, to illustrate the disastrous results
              of global warming via various man-made and climate-related disasters.
              Included in the presentation was the short clip &quot;Global
              Warming or: None Like It Hot&quot; from the animated TV show <i>Futurama</i>,
              taken from a 2002 episode in which Gore guest-starred, about the
              effects of greenhouse gases. His descriptions were illustrated
              by before-and-after photographs of the effects of global warming
              on various landmarks, such as the mountain peaks of Mt. Kilimanjaro,
              and on glaciers at the poles. In one scene, he used a scissors-style
              fork lift to raise himself up on the right side of a mammoth graphic
              to examine annual temperature and the drastically high, rising
              rate of CO2 emissions levels for the past 650,000 years, measured
              by Antarctic ice core samples. His ultimate conclusion was: &quot;I
              don't really consider this a political issue, I consider it to
              be a moral issue.&quot; The closing credits included recommendations
              in answer to the question: &quot;Are you ready to change the way you
          live?&quot; </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Last King of Scotland (2006, UK/Germ.),</b> 121
              minutes, D: Kevin MacDonald<br />
              The title of this British historical  and political docu-drama
              referred to brutal Ugandan President Idi Amin (Oscar-winning Forest
              Whitaker) and his reign as a despotic dictator from 1971 to 1979.
              A reporter during a press conference once asked Amin if he had
              referred to himself as &quot;the last king of Scotland.&quot; Its story was
              based upon Giles Foden's 1998 novel of the same name, regarding
              the memoirs of a fictional Scottish physician named Dr. Nicholas
              Garrigan (James McAvoy), a graduate of the University of Edinburgh's
              medical school, who worked for Amin. For excitement and hedonistic
              adventure, the idealistic young man was first employed at a rural
              Ugandan missionary clinic before he happened to meet and treat
              Amin's injured hand after a car crash. When Amin realized that
              Garrigan was Scottish (a nationality he admired for the people's
              resistance to Britain), the doctor was hired as Amin's personal
              physician and put in charge of the nation's healthcare system.
              From the perspective of Garrigan, he observed as Amin's regime
              became more oppressive and violent. He stood by as Amin murdered
                those who opposed and resisted, including his deportation of
               Asians, and the elimination of supporters of the previous leader
              Obete. Garrigan unwisely regarded and was willfully ignorant of
              Amin's repressive and xenophobic actions, as he became Amin's most
              trusted advisor. The doctor watched, however, as Amin became increasingly
              more paranoid, erratic, egomaniacal, and involved in torture, revenge
              killings, and other massacres. He became acutely and personally
              aware of the polygamous Amin's deadly potential when he engaged
              in adulterous sex with one of Amin's ostracized wives named Kay
              (Kerry Washington) after she gave birth to an epileptic child.
              Complications arose when Kay was impregnated, and Garrigan was
              unable to immediately provide her with an abortion. When  she
              sought a primitive witch-doctor abortion instead in a village,
              she was apprehended by Amin's forces and brutally dismembered for
              her betrayal. Garrigan finally understood the enormous inhumanity
              of Amin's regime, and that if he was ever to escape from Ugandan
              rule, he must assassinate Amin. An attempted murder plot (via poisoned
              pills) failed, and Garrigan was brutally tortured and punished.
              He was dangled from the ceiling by ropes and left to die - hanging
              by two meat hooks pierced through his chest's nipples. With the
              assistance of his medical colleague Dr. Junju (David Oyelowo),
              Garrigan successfully fled from the country, although Junju was
              killed for his complicity. An epilogue provided details of the
              aftermath: the Israeli rescue of hostages at the Entebbe airport,
              Amin's overthrow in 1979, and his death in exile in 2003. He had
              been responsible for 300,000 deaths in Uganda.</font></p>        </td>

              Clint Eastwood<br />
              Director Clint Eastwood's WWII war-combat drama was the companion
              film to his own <i>Flags of Our Fathers (2006)</i>, but now 
			  conveyed from the Japanese POV
              (and in Japanese with subtitles). Told mostly in flashback, it
              portrayed the mortal struggle of the forces of the Imperial Japanese
              Army to hold the island of Iwo Jima for 36 days during the early
              1945 battle against US forces for the strategic Mount Suribachi.
              Inspiring and commanding Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken
              Watanabe) (with an American Colt .45) was opposed to some of his
              more traditionalist, rigid and elderly military subordinates, including
              Admiral Ohsugi (Nobumasa Sakagami). With support from Lieutenant
              Colonel Baron Takeichi Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), Kuribayashi devised
              an unconventional, tactical strategy of deep underground tunnels
              and foxholes. Both Nishi and Kuribayashi had some experience in
              America and knew that facing the US Marines head-on at the beach
              was a foolish and self-defeating tactic. The action and events
              surrounding the war were conveyed through letters written home
              by some of the Japanese soldiers (and by Kuribayashi to his son
              Taro) who feared the outcome and were aware that they would probably
              die. Some of the individual Japanese soldiers included reluctantly-recruited
               Pvt. First Class Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) - a baker with
              a pregnant wife, dishonorably-discharged ex-military policeman
              Superior Private Shimizu (Ryo Kase), and kamikaze-leaning and fiercely-obedient
              Lieutenant Ito (Shidou Nakamura) who would nobly die for his country's
              cause by any means. When the grim warfare and a surprise final
              attack claimed most of the lives of the Japanese troops, the critically-wounded
              Kuribayashi committed suicide with his own American handgun. After
              Saigo buried him, he was taken prisoner (as a POW) by a US patrol.</font></p>        </td>

              Field<br />
              Based upon Tom Perrotta's 2004 novel, director Todd Field's character-driven,
              marriage melodrama was about the residents of an upper middle-class
              suburban town near Boston, MA. The characters included a group
              of individuals in the neighborhood whose lives intersected. Sarah
              Pierce (Kate Winslet) was a bored, 30 year-old, unfulfilled suburban
              wife and mother (of 5 year-old daughter Lucy (Sadie Goldstein)),
              married to Richard Pierce (Gregg Edelman). Her loveless and dysfunctional
              marriage was crumbling and abandoned due to Richard's addiction
              to Internet pornography. One day in the park, playground mom Sarah
              met Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), a preppy-looking, aspiring law
              student and an immature, underachieving, handsome &quot;Prom
              King&quot; neighbor/house-husband. Like Sarah, the stay-at-home
              dad had a 4 year-old son Aaron (Ty Simpkins) and was involved in
              an unsatisfying marriage to career-driven Katherine &quot;Kathy&quot; Adamson
              (Jennifer Connelly), a beautiful, PBS documentary filmmaker and
              the home's breadwinner. Both discontented, Sarah and Brad wished
              to recapture their lost adolescent innocence in a fantasy reality.
              After Brad leered at Sarah's bright, one-piece red bathing suit
              while she was sunbathing in the summer heat next to him at the
              pool, their flirtations ultimately initial platonic feelings led
              to an illicit adulterous affair. In the meantime, convicted child
              sex predator Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; James McGorvey  (Jackie
              Earle Haley) was released and returned to his mother May's (Phyllis
              Somerville) home in the neighborhood. Another character named Larry
              Hedges (Noah Emmerich) encouraged Brad to join his amateur football
              team, the Guardians, to feel youthful again. Estranged from his
              wife, Larry was an ex-police officer after forced retirement for
              accidentally shooting a teenaged robbery suspect. With the release
              of pedophile McGorvey into the mix, Hedges engaged
              in an obsessive campaign to rid the neighborhood of the sex offender.
              Meanwhile, May's misaimed desire to cure her son Ronnie of his
              pedophilia led her to arrange a disastrous blind date for him with
              depressed Sheila (Jane Adams). A dinner party between the Pierces
              and Adamsons confirmed Kathy's suspicions about her husband's infidelity.
              When Brad suggested a romantic getaway to figure it all out together,
              Sarah was disbelieving but agreed to meet at the park the next
              night to run away - although unforeseen circumstances prevented
              both of them from carrying out their plan. In the shocking ending,
              Ronnie's mother May unexpectedly died from a heart attack, indirectly
              caused by Larry (who was later arrested for assault and battery).
              Distraught over his mother's demise, Ronnie castrated himself with
              a butcher knife and was bleeding to death in the park, where he
              was found by a remorseful and forgiving Larry. Sarah had already
              left the park and returned home with Lucy after changing her mind
              about eloping with Brad. The same night, Brad knocked himself out
              after impulsively trying to skateboard with teenagers, and was
              taken to the hospital. Most of the main principals (Larry, Ronnie,
              Brad and Kathy) were led to come together at the hospital as the
              film ended.</font></p>        </td>

              Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris<br /> 
        This quirky, Best Picture-nominated light domestic comedy and road trip
        movie was about an odd-ball, dysfunctional, Albuquerque, NM family
        - the Hoovers. The eccentric members in the ensemble film included pudgy,
        glasses-wearing 7 year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin), her rakish, foul-mouthed,
        retirement home-evicted, but loving grandfather Edwin Hoover (Oscar-winning
        Alan Arkin), Type-A family patriarch Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) -
        a failed motivational speaker and life coach with a &quot;Refuse
          to Lose&quot; philosophy, and Richard's overworked and anxious wife
          Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette). Sheryl's suicide-prone, gay, Proust
          scholar, and unemployed brother Uncle Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell)
          also lived with the family, along with Sheryl's cynical, Nietzsche-reading,
          voluntarily-mute son Dwayne Hoover (Paul Dano) from her previous marriage.
          Aspiring beauty queen Olive's main determined ambition was to compete
          in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' beauty pageant in Redondo Beach, CA.
          The bickering family set off together for an 800-mile, cross-country
          road trip to Southern California in the family's yellow VW microbus/van
          to join her. Many misadventures along the way, including car trouble,
          demonstrated the family's need to work together. During the trip, Edwin
          died from a heroin overdose (and they kept the corpse in the van to
          avoid delay), and Dwayne learned that he was color-blind - a career-changing
          event that broke his 'vow of silence.' The film satirically portrayed
          the local pageant as a sexually-provocative event for the pre-pubescent
          contestants (who wore garish makeup, styled hair, and raunchy clothing
          along the lines of Jon-Benet Ramsay). The other young competitors performed
          sexy night-club songs and dances - while the sweet wannabee and amateurish
          Olive performed an over-sexualized dance to Rick James' <i>Superfreak</i>,
          a cringe-inducing pretend striptease routine (taught to her by Edwin).
          Even though Olive kept her clothes on, she crawled like a cat in heat,
          and threw articles of clothing off the stage. Although cheered on by
          her family, Olive horrified the audience and repulsed the contest
          organizers who were forced to admit the actual sexual sub-text of their
          exploitative event. At the end of her performance, Olive's family members
          joined her on stage. The exultant family, although forbidden  to ever
           enter another California beauty pageant, returned to Albuquerque. </font></p>        </td>

                der Anderen),</b> 137 minutes, D: Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck<br />
                Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's socio-political
                dramatic spy-thriller was his debut feature film and the Oscar
                winner for Best Foreign Language Film. It provided insight into
                the ugly, Stasi-ridden and surveilled world of the 1980s East
                German state. Spanning from the Orwellian year
                of 1984 (five years before Glasnost and the fall of the Berlin
                Wall) to 1991 when Germany was reunited, it depicted the final
                years of the city and exposed the harsh way of life under the
                former GDR. The film provided a gripping picture of two contrasting
                worlds and ways of life in the DDR with many authentic locales
                depicted. It was a deeply-emotional, humanizing character study
                of secret police surveillance agent Capt. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler
                (Ulrich M&uuml;he), a lonely and alienated member of the East
                German Stasi (secret police) in 1984 working for East Germany's
                internal spy network in a dreary tower-block. Round-the-clock,
                Wiesler kept watch over various artists and dissidents, while
                supervised by Lt. Col. Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur). His main
                bugging target was the apartment of suspected but successful,
                internationally-reknowned Socialist playwright Georg Dreyman
                (Sebastian Koch), who was in a romantic relationship with devoted
                live-in lover and actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).
                Over time, Wiesler learned that Christa-Maria had been blackmailed
                into a sexual relationship with an infatuated, corrupt German
                official, Cultural Department head Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas
                Thieme), in exchange for prescription drugs and protection. She
                cleansed herself of the filth (both physically and emotionally)
                afterwards in the bathtub/shower. The Stasi agent Wiesler had
                to make difficult choices as he found himself drawn into their
                lives and sympathetically took sides with them as their &quot;guardian
                angel.&quot;  
                 Christa-Maria became despairing and fearful that she had revealed
                 - under pressure -  Dreyman's authorship of a damaging article
                 (about the state's concealment of suicide rates), and the hidden
                 location in the apartment of his unregistered miniature typewritten
                 (with a red ribbon) used for the article. Feeliing that she
                 had betrayed Dreyman, she deliberately ran into the street and
                 was struck dead by a vehicle. Afterwards, Wiesler was demoted
                 by Grubitz and given a dead-end job that he held until 1989
                 when the political situation drastically changed. In the revealing
                 conclusion, Dreyman (after reading declassified Stasi surveillance
                 transcripts years later) realized that Wiesler had actually
                 concealed Dreyman's illegal activities and had actually protected
                 him by removing the typewriter. In the closing scene set in
                 1993, former guard Wiesler walked on the Karl Marx Allee (the
                 main shopping and parade street of the GDR) in East Berlin where
                 he noticed Dreyman's memoirs on display and for sale in a bookstore
                 window. He was surprised to see that the book was gratefully
                 dedicated to HGW XX/7, Wiesler's own code-name. </font></p>          </td>

            Writer/director John Carney's low-budget, wistful romantic musical-drama
                with a minimalist plot seamlessly integrated its many songs into
                an unforced musical story. The moving, independent film told
                about a boy-meets-girl couple in Dublin, Ireland over the course
                of a week - between simply-named, Hoover vacuum-repairman Guy
                (Irish rock-band Frames musician Glen Hansard) and Girl (Czech
                singer Mark&eacute;ta
                Irglov&aacute;).
                He was an unidentified street musician (with a six-stringed violin)
                who often performed Van Morrison songs in the daytime and his
                own compositions at night in Dublin's Grafton Street shopping
                district. He wrote original songs about his ex-girlfriend (Marcella
                Plunkett) in London who had cheated on him and then left him.
                She was a poor, 19 year-old Czech immigrant and single mother
                with a toddler (Kate Haugh), who lived with her mother (Danuse
                Ktrestova), and peddled roses and cleaned houses, although she
                was a classically-trained pianist and vocalist. The two kindred
                spirits were immediately drawn together by their respective broken
                relationships, although with limited time to get to know each
                other. Tucked into this simple Irish import was a charming duet
                at the piano between them, singing the Oscar-winning Original
                Song tune &quot;<i>Falling
                Slowly</i>&quot;
                while in a nearly-empty music store -- among the film's many
                songs. The film's main virtue was the off-beat naturalism of
                the couple's growing platonic, bittersweet relationship and their
                strong bonds over music that incorporated their own love story.
                Everything culminated in the soulmates' collaboration  
                to record a demo album at a recording studio over a marathon
                weekend. Toward the end of the film, the Girl revealed to Guy
                that her estranged Czech husband (Senan Haugh) was arriving
                to live with her in Dublin. Guy was unable to meet up with the
                Girl before leaving for London to live with his ex-girlfriend,
                and attempt to land a music contract. However, he arranged for
                the purchase and delivery of a piano for the Girl just before
                his departure. </font></p></td>

                This fantasy film, not kid-friendly,
                presented an inventive, multi-level world of war-time horror
                within an adult legend. Elements of the fantasy films and novels <i>Alice
                in Wonderland</i> and <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, and <i>Spirited
                Away</i> resonated from the film. Its major themes were - destiny
                lies in one's decisions or judgments, and in darkness or death
                there can be light or life. A prologue told a legend important
                to remember as the film proceeded and concluded with a book-ending
                epilogue. Princess Moana (Ivana Baquero), daughter of the King
                of the underworld, escaped up to the human world where she was
                blinded by sunlight, lost her memory, became ill and died. Her
                father believed that her long-lost soul would eventually return
                by the next full moon, perhaps in another body, place, or time.
                Set during the mid-1940s in northern Spain in a time of civil
                war, Franco's repressive forces had taken hold. Pre-pubescent
                11 year-old orphaned heroine Ofelia (also Baquero) accompanied
                her sickly pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to meet up with
                her brutally sadistic new stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez)
                in a small remote Spanish district. The embodiment of Spanish
                fascism, he had established his headquarters in an abandoned
                mill where he led troops to quell the rebel resistance. Del Toro
                efficiently captured the tyranny and brutishness of the oppressively
                evil and vain Captain. He personally murdered two innocent rabbit-hunting
                farmers (a father and son), then blithely dismissed his wrongdoing
                by having his chief house-keeping servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu),
                who was secretly sympathizing with and aiding the rebels, prepare
                a stew with the rabbit meat. Ofelia escaped the cruel real-world
                horrors by fleeing (or returning home) to the fairy-tale story
                world (with its own serious dangers) that wanted her back. Transitions
                between the two worlds were often prefaced by vertical camera
                wipes. Her mother had skeptically warned: &quot;Fairy tales?
                You're a bit too old to be filling your head with such nonsense.&quot; CGI,
                animatronics puppets, prosthetics and extensive latex makeup
                were used to create the film's magical creatures, including the
                opening's vibrating, stick-like, preying mantis that was transformed
                into a fairy. After being led into the maze-like garden labyrinth,
                she encountered a mysterious, ominous, tall goat-headed forest
                Faun (Doug Jones) with curled horns - not Pan. (The movie title
                was somewhat misleading. In fact, the film's Spanish title translated
                'Labyrinth of the Faun.') When the enigmatic Faun identified
                Ofelia as the reincarnated Princess, she was challenged to a
                quest - three risky and daunting tasks to prove herself and reunite
                her with the underground realm and her true father: (1) retrieve
                a golden key vomited from the belly of a monstrous toad, and
                (2) retrieve a dagger from behind a locked small rock door in
                the lair of the monstrous, child-eating, faceless Pale Man (also
                Jones), with his eyes set into the palms of his stigmatic hands.
                (Note: The key and knife were also mirrored in the real-world,
                as was the mandrake root.) And then, her third task (3) became
                a climactic, self-sacrificial test of Ofelia's obedience and
                courage in the film's tragic yet redemptive conclusion.        </font></p></td>

        The sequel to <a href="series-piratesofcaribbean.html"><i>Pirates of
        the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)</i></a> was this fantasy-adventure
         swashbuckler. It was the second installment of the very popular 
		 <a href="series-piratesofcaribbean.html"><em>Pirates
        of the Caribbean</em></a> franchise-series, followed by  other films,
        including: <i><a href="series-piratesofcaribbean3.html">At World's End (2007)</a></i>,
		 <i><a href="series-piratesofcaribbean4.html">On
        Stranger Tides (2011)</a></i>, and <i><a href="series-piratesofcaribbean5.html">Dead
        Men Tell No Tales (2017)</a></i>. In this sequel, the wedding ceremony
        of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and fiancee Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley)
        was interrupted by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) (chairman of the
        East India Trading Company) as they prepared to exchange vows. He arrested
        them and sentenced them to death. Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport),
         who had lost his own ship <i>HMS Dauntless</i> (and
        his commission in the Royal Navy) was also to be arrested, but had disappeared
        after a futile search to capture Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp),
         commander of <i>The Black Pearl</i>. Beckett demanded that Turner set
         out on a mission that if successful would free him and Elizabeth. At
         the same time, Captain Jack  was required to pay 
         his  overdue blood debt to the legendary Davy Jones
        (Bill Nighy), part-fish/part-human ruler of the ocean and tortured captain
        of his ghostly ship <i>The Flying Dutchman</i>. Voodoo priestess Tia Dalma
        (Naomie Harris) explained  the legend of Davy Jones - that whoever possessed
         Davy Jones' carved-out, disembodied heart, locked inside the Dead Man's
        Chest, could control Jones. While Sparrow was being hunted
        by Jones,  his main goal was to locate  the Dead Man's Chest and
        free himself from Jones' servitude. Will (and Elizabeth who was freed
        and escaped from prison) also sought Jack and his magic compass.
        Sparrow made a deal with Will to give him his compass in exchange for the key
        that would open the Dead Man's Chest. Tricked by Sparrow, Will
        boarded Jones' <i>Flying Dutchman </i>and
        was captured, where Jones agreed to release Jack from their bargain
              in exchange for one hundred souls if acquired within three days.
              After reuniting with his deceased father Bootstrap Bill Turner
              who was in servitude to Jones, Will located the key (in Jones'
              possession) and escaped, with the promise to return to save his
              father. Shortly later on the island of Isla Cruces, Jack, Elizabeth,
              Norrington (who had joined the <i>Black Pearl's</i> crew) and Will
              all came together. Elizabeth located the chest (with the help of
              Jack's compass) containing the heart of Davy Jones, and with Will
              and the key, they opened the chest. Both Sparrow and Will had different
              intentions for Davy Jones' 'heart' - Jack wanted it to call off
              the threatened Kraken, repay or end his debt to Jones, and to become
              immortal, while Will wanted it to rescue and save his father from
              a life of servitude to Jones. A third individual, Norrington,
              also wanted the 'heart' to resume his life in the Navy, rule the
              seas, and continue his quest to destroy all piracy. In the exciting
              culmination, Norrington secretly stole the 'heart' in a jar, while
              Jones attacked the <i>Black Pearl</i> with both the <i>Dutchman</i> and the Kraken.
               Jack survived on a lifeboat and returned to battle the monstrous
               creature, but was tricked and chained to the heavily-damaged <i>Pearl's</i> mast
               to save everyone else. He was dragged down with the <i>Pearl</i> to
               the sea depths and Davy Jones' Locker. Norrington  returned
               to Port Royal with the 'heart', and bestowed it on Beckett. Norrington
               was reinstated, while Beckett regained control of Davy Jones and
               the seas. The <i>Pearl's</i> surviving crew sheltered with Tia Dalma, 
			   with plans to rescue Jack from the afterlife with the help of 
			   resurrected Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Prestige (2006),</b> 130 minutes, D: Christopher
              Nolan<br />
              The tale in Christopher Nolan-directed mystery-drama and psychological
              thriller was made even more complex by moving back and
              forth across time periods (and having flashbacks within flashbacks)
              that led up to the film's climax. It had
              a very appropriate and thematic tagline (&quot;A Friendship That
              Became a Rivalry&quot;) - referencing dueling stage magicians in
              Victorian London at the end of the 19th century: working-class,
              Cockney-accented Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and flashy, aristocratic
              showman Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), whose friendship turned into
              a deadly one-upmanship competition - a teleportation trick.
              Originally, both individuals were  friends and assistants of
              elderly &quot;Milton the Magician&quot; (Ricky Jay), but an on-stage
              accident (the death of Angier's wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo)
              by drowning in a water tank) inspired their hatred for each other.
              They began to ruthlessly compete as two vengeful stage illusionists,
              Borden known as &quot;The Professor&quot; with a mysterious, mute
              assistant, and Angier known as &quot;The Great Danton&quot; who
              was assisted by blonde Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) and
              stage engineer John Cutter (Michael Caine). They each competed
              with a climactic, disappearing act first known as the &quot;Transported
              Man&quot; trick. In Borden's act, he had hired an exact disguised
              double, Bernard Fallon (also Bale), a twin - to perform his version
              of the trick. To create an even more (and supernatural) dramatic
              trick, Angier traveled to Colorado in the US to hire real-life
              inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to create a teleportation device
              (or cloning machine) to accomplish the feat.  The device 
              created an exact replica of Angier during the spark-filled transport
              within a large trapezoidal box. Every time the trick was performed,
              however, Angier's cloned double routinely had to die - by drowning,
              in a locked water tank below the machine. During  one of Angier's
              performances of his 'Real Transported Man' trick, he disappeared
              and fell through a trap door from above, and seemingly drowned
              in a water tank located beneath the stage. Borden witnessed the
              drowning backstage, and was accused of the
              crime of Angier's murder when found by Cutter. Unable to prove
              his innocence, Borden  was imprisoned and sentenced to hang (although
              later it was revealed that he was falsely accused). Just before
              Borden's execution by hanging on death row, a collector named Lord
              Caldlow - actually Angier in disguise - appeared at the prison.
              Angier confessed that had remorselessly framed
              Borden by staging his own drowning murder. After Borden's 'death,'
              Angier returned to the theatre where he was shot by a second 'Borden.'
              As Angier slowly died, Borden (Alfred actually) explained how he
              had an illusionary twin 'double' for himself (Fallon) (the one
              who was executed), so that the transporter trick could be accomplished.
              Angier then showed Borden how he had performed the trick by
              showing him water tanks holding the drowned Angier clones inside
              of them. Angier died and kicked over a lamp, setting the theatre
              on fire. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Queen (2006, UK/It./Fr.),</b> 97 minutes, D:
        Stephen Frears<br />
        Director Stephen Frears biographical, political and family drama (although
        partially fictionalized) opened with the 1997 election of the Labour
        Party's Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as the UK's Prime Minister, and the
        reporting of former Princess of Wales Diana's (as Herself in archival
        footage) fatal car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997. The Royal Family
        and the Prime Minister found themselves at odds about how to react to
        the great outpouring of grief from the public for a beloved figure who
        had experienced a difficult breakup with Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).
        The Royals responded with coolness and a lack of sympathy to Diana's
        place in British history (since they considered it a private matter due
        to Diana no longer being a member of the Royal Family), while remaining
        on holiday at their Scottish estate-retreat, Balmoral Castle. The press,
        tabloids and media responded to the people's intense mourning by also
        noticing the indifference, obliviousness, and insulting hesitation of
        Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren), Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (James
        Cromwell) and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms). In private
        and in public, the newly-elected Blair attempted to restore confidence
        and convince the royal family to express some kind of meaningful tribute
        to Diana (&quot;The People's Princess&quot;), realizing that otherwise,
        their PR disaster would intensify and they would be regarded as out-of-touch.
        Already, it had been known that the royals considered the public's reaction
        hysterical and thought a reaction would be undignified. Blair confronted
        the Queen with news that 70% of the country believed she was damaging
        the monarchy, while 25% of Britons were in favor of ending the monarchy.
        In a  metaphorical sequence about the loss of tradition and
        the changing world, the Queen drove into the country, became stranded
        in the wild, and then  encountered by chance a vulnerable, magnificent,
        and wild &quot;14 pointer&quot; stag. She shooed it away to safety when
         hunters approached. Later, she visited
        the stag in a bleeding room - it had been killed and beheaded by a paying
        guest/hunter, an investment banker from London on a neighboring estate
        - and she stated: &quot;I hope he didn't suffer too much.&quot; 
		Blair eventually convinced the
        demoralized Queen to acknowledge Diana's death by delivering a comforting
        public address, paying her respects, and flying the Union flag at half-mast
        over Buckingham Palace. The Queen acquiesed with a public live-TV
        address and by convincing the royal family to attend the public
        funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey. In the film's closing scene
        in the Royal Gardens with Tony Blair, the Queen opened up personally
        about her position: &quot;I prefer to keep my feelings to myself, and,
        foolishly, I believed that was what the people wanted from their Queen
        - not to make a fuss, nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve. Duty first,
        self second. That's how I was brought up. That's all I've ever known....But
        I can see that the world has changed, and one must modernize.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

        Director/star Sylvester Stallone also wrote the screenplay for this sports
        drama - the 6th installment reboot in the long-running
		<a href="series-rocky.html"><em>Rocky</em></a> franchise-series
        that began 30 years earlier in <a href="rock.html"><i>Rocky (1976)</i></a>.
        It functioned as the sequel to <i><a href="series-rocky5.html">Rocky
        V (1990)</a></i>. By this time, the retired boxer (former two-time heavyweight
        champion) and widowed 58 year-old Rocky Balboa (Stallone) was still living
        in a working-class neighborhood of Philadelphia. In memory of his late-wife
        (Talia Shire) who passed away from ovarian cancer in 2002 (four years
        earlier), he owned and operated an Italian restaurant named &quot;Adrian's.&quot;
        He was experiencing a strained relationship with his grown-up, resentful,
        business-executive son Robert Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), and also spent
        time with Adrian's brother Paulie (Burt Young), who often expressed guilt
        over how he treated  his own sister. Rocky became supportive of a Lucky
        Seven bartender named Marie (Geraldine Hughes) who was a single mother
        caring for her illegitimate, teenaged child Stephenson (&quot;Steps&quot;) (James
        Francis Kelly III). Rocky befriended &quot;Steps&quot; and 
        hired her as his restaurant's hostess and barmaid. He had briefly met
        her 30 years earlier as a troubled 12 year-old delinquent teenager (Jodi
        Letizia) on the street and had given her advice, but she lashed back: &quot;Screw
        you, creepo!&quot; It was time for Rocky to have a predictable, boxing ring comeback, after
        ESPN broadcast a computer-simulated match between Rocky and the current
        undefeated (arrogant and unpopular) heavyweight champion Mason &quot;The
        Line&quot; Dixon (real-life boxer Antonio Tarver). Dixon's handlers wanted to rehabilitate
        his image by fighting Rocky, and Rocky wanted to prove to himself that
        he could still fight and win as a true challenger, and also provide an
        outlet for his growing emotional pain and anger. He renewed his boxing
        license and began to train (with support from Paulie, Robert Jr. and
        ex-trainer Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Evers (Tony Burton)),
        to face the mediocre fighter Dixon in a charity-exhibition match at the
        Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. After a training montage
        and fanfare that opened the match, it was a fight that would be determined
        by which fighter had the most stamina. In the 10th and final round, Rocky
        was beaten but determined to outlast Dixon - and throw the last punch.
        The bout was won by Dixon in a split decision, although the crowd roared
        their approval for Rocky as he exited. In the film's conclusion, Rocky
        left a flower on Adrian's grave - telling her: &quot;Yo, Adrian,
        we did it.&quot; An inset montage of <i> </i>clips (climbing the 72

        Director Bryan Singer's sci-fi superhero film was the  6th (and final)
        installment in the original <a href="series-superman.html"><i>Superman</i></a> film
        series - a reboot (or pseudo-sequel) that came 19 years after the end
        of the original Christopher Reeve series of four films from 1978 to 1987.
        It was an &quot;homage sequel&quot; that served as a continuation of
        the first two films in the original series -- <a href="series-superman.html"><i>Superman
        (1978)</i></a> and <a href= "series-superman2.html"><i>Superman II (1980)</i></a> --
        while ignoring installments III and IV. The next film after this one
		would be the completely-rebooted <a href="series-superman6.html"><i>Man of
		Steel (2013)</i></a>,
		part of the <a href="superheroes-dcextended.html"><i>DC Extended Universe</i></a>.
		The setting in this film was about five years after the events
		of the first two films during which time Superman
		had mysteriously disappeared and had been almost entirely forgotten.
		Evidence of Superman's irrelevance was his ex-love interest and <i>Daily Planet</i> reporter
		Lois Lane's (Kate Bosworth) Pulitzer-winner article: &quot;Why the World Doesn't
		Need Superman.&quot; Paroled from prison and avoiding a double-life sentence,
		Superman's sociopathic arch-enemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) had married
		elderly and terminally-ill Gertrude Vanderworth (Noel Neill) to swindle
		her fortune. His first dastardly act, with his henchwoman-moll Kitty
		Kowalski (Parker Posey), was to steal and steer Gertrude's private yacht
		to Superman's Fortress of Solitude to find a holographic image of Superman's
		father, Jor-El (Marlon Brando in archival footage), and to steal crystals
		of kryptonite. His plan was to grow the crystals in water, to punish
		Superman. During his long absence, Superman (Brandon Routh) had made
		an extended (and futile) visit to his destroyed home planet of Krypton,
		before returning to Metropolis and resuming his duties as <i>Daily Planet</i> reporter
            Clark Kent. His first act was to save Lois onboard a distressed,
            reporter-filled NASA jetliner (with a piggy-backed
            shuttle during a launch into space) that was about to crash into
            a baseball stadium filled with fans. Lex was responsible for sending
            an electro-magnetic pulse that had caused a brief power outage, crippling
            the plane. Lois now lived with her young son Jason (Tristan Lake
		Leabu) (Superman's offspring?) and long-time suitor-fianc&eacute;e,
            Richard White (James Marsden), the nephew of the <i>Daily Planet</i> editor-in-chief
            Perry White (Frank Langella). Luthor was able to distract Superman
            during his theft of a chunk of kryptonite (Addis Ababa meteorite)
            from the Metropolis Museum of Natural History for his next scheme.
            Luthor's new sinister and dastardly but brilliant plot was to build
            his own new continental land mass from the lethal kryptonite and
            the crystals (harmful to Superman) in the N. Atlantic. With the oceans
            rising due to his nation-building, billions would drown from rising
            oceans, and the survivors would be charged exorbitant prices to live
            on his newly-grown continent. Superman was called upon to rescue
            Lois, Richard, and Jason (revealed to have superhuman powers!) before
            he left to confront Luthor at the 'New Krypton' continent, where
            he was immediately weakened by the kryptonite. The Man of Steel was
            beaten and stabbed by Luthor with a shard of kryptonite, but fortunately
            was saved by Lois, Richard, and Jason who flew back in a small seaplane
            to rescue him. With his strength restored from the Sun, Superman
            flew under the huge, kryptonite-laced land mass and hoisted the 
            continent into the air before throwing it into space. However, in
            a weakened state, he crashed back to Earth (landing in  Metropolis'
            Central Park). Meanwhile, Luthor and Kitty fled in a helicopter,
            but it ran out of fuel and stranded them on an island. Comatose and
            hospitalized (and possibly dead), Superman was resurrected by Lois'
            whispered secret - that he had a son. Later that night, Superman
            found Lois at her home writing a new revised article - &quot;Why
            the World Needs Superman,&quot; where he spoke Jor-el's last words
            to Jason: (&quot;The
            son becomes the father, and the father becomes the son&quot;) before
            flying away, but soon to keep watch.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>300 (2006)</strong>, 116 minutes, D: Zach
              Snyder<br />
            Director Zack Snyder's very original, highly-stylized, computer-generated,
             epic war-drama (with elements of fantasy) was
            based on Frank Miller's 1998 comic book novel - it was a shot-by-shot
            adaptation of the comic-book panels. The title referred
            to the 300 incredibly-buffed, heroic, all-volunteer Spartan warriors
            who fought to the death during the Persian Wars. The ultra-violent
            film was voice-over narrated in flashback by  Spartan warrior/storyteller
            Dilios (David Wenham). He told about the overwhelmed and outnumbered
            Greek forces of legendary and fearless Spartan ruler-warrior King
            Leonidas (Gerard Butler) who fought an heroic last stand against
            the invading 120,000 Persian forces of the giant &quot;God-King&quot; Xerxes
            (Rodrigo Santoro) at the three-day Battle of Thermopylae, c. 480
            B.C. As a battle strategy, Leonidas' plan was to block the only way
            by land to reach Greece, through  the passage of Thermopylae. He
            decided  to funnel the Persian enemy into the Hot Gates (the
            literal translation of &quot;Thermopylae&quot;),
            a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea, where the Spartans'
            heavy-infantry forces could vanquish the Persians. However, it was
            decreed by the Ephors (priests) that war was not allowed during the
            sacred festival of Carneia, but Leonidas set out with his small contingent
            of 'bodyguard' troops anyway. Their strategy was successful, and
            waves and waves of Xerxes' warriors and allies (including Indian
            war elephants) were defeated in the narrow pass. The betrayal of
            a spiteful, traitorous, disfigured and outcast Spartan-shepherd named
            Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan) (by defecting and telling Xerxes of a
            secret goat pathway to encircle and outflank the enemy) doomed the
            Spartans. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, the loyal Queen Gorgo (Lena
            Headey), Leonidas' wife, begged the Spartan Council and the devious
            corrupt politician Theron (Dominic West) (a traitor bought off by
            Xerxes with gold) to send reinforcements, although she was initially
            denied support. She was forced to commit adultery with Theron to
            gain his approval. But then, after the Queen revealed Theron's double-betrayal,
             she killed him. The Council agreed to approve troops, but it was
            too late. The film's climax was the momentous and bloody sequence
            of the last-stand day of the battle between the opposing forces.
            God-King Xerxes' was revealed to be mortal when a spear sliced his
            cheek, drawing blood. It included the moving, spiritual operatic
            ballet of death of King Leonidas of Sparta on the battlefield - he
            was the last survivor of the 300 Spartans, who had refused to surrender.
            He called out in his final breath to his wife Queen Gorgo, pledging
            his love to her: &quot;My Queen! My wife. My love...&quot; He
            raised his arms to the side, as he was assailed by hundreds of arrows
            that blackened the screen with the sheer number of projectiles. The
            next scene opened on the beautiful, sad face of his wife, receiving
            the news of her husband's death. The film's conclusion, a year later,
            portrayed Dilios now leading 30,000 free Greek soldiers (led by 
            10,000 Spartans) to again battle against the Persians, who commemorated
            their fight to the sacrificial 300. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>United 93 (2006),</b> 111 minutes, D: Paul Greengrass<br />
            Director Paul Greengrass' visceral, tense and upsetting docu-drama
                was created five years after the horrific 9/11 terrorist attacks
                on the US (involving the Twin Towers in NYC and four hijacked
                planes). The events of the day (involving
                the fourth hijacked plane, United # 93 bound from Newark, NJ
                to San Francisco, CA) were portrayed or reconstructed in real-time,
                cutting back and forth between air-traffic controllers,
                the passengers themselves, the plane's crew, family members on
                the ground, the FAA and the military Defense Command Center. Earlier,
                when the first plane, American Airlines # 11 (from Boston, MA
                to Los Angeles, CA) crashed into the North Tower, one of the
                buildings at the World Trade Center, it was not thought to be
                deliberate. But then 16 minutes later, a second plane, United
                Airlines # 175 (also from Boston, MA to Los Angeles, CA) also
                hit the second Twin Tower, and a third plane, American Airlines
                # 77 (from Washington DC to Los Angeles, CA) crashed into the
                Pentagon. At that point, it was deemed a major emergency and
                US &quot;airspace&quot; was immediately shut down. The crew of United #
                93, already in the air, was notified of the other attacks. On
                board # 93 were four Middle-Eastern, al-Qaeda terrorists whose
                original plan was to crash the plane into either the US Capitol
                building or the White House. The terrorists on the plane began
                to assemble a fake bomb, threaten and kill passengers and crew,
                and move all first-class passengers to the rear of the plane.
                After the flight crew pilots were killed, one of the hijacker-terrorists
                Ziad Jarrah (Khalid Abdalla) took control of the aircraft in
                the locked cockpit, as passengers phoned their loved ones and
                learned of the other attacks. A group of brave passengers, including
                Jeremy Glick (Peter Hermann),  Tom Burnett (Christian Clemenson)
                and Todd Beamer (David Alan Basche) and others, then planned
                a coordinated revolt and strike against the hijackers with makeshift
                weapons, to storm the cockpit and retake control. They finally
                breached the cockpit door, where during a struggle for control,
                the plane was placed into a nose-dive and ultimately ended up
                crashing in a empty field in Shanksville, PA.</font></p>        </td>

              Almod&oacute;var<br />
        Writer/director Pedro Almod&oacute;var's tragic comedic drama (subtitled
        in Spanish) was a mother-daughter tale amongst three generations of women
        in Spanish families. The ensemble cast drama opened with two main characters
        in the mid-2000s: Raimunda (Pen&eacute;lope
        Cruz) and her younger sister Sole (Lola Due&ntilde;as) were still grieving
        over the house-fire death of their mother Irene (Carmen Maura) (and her
        husband) three years earlier in their hometown village. Raimunda, a janitor
        now living in Madrid, was married to unemployed, often-drunk and slovenly
        Paco (Antonio de la Torre). Both were caring for 14 year-old daughter
        named Paula (Yohana Cobo) (but Paco was not her biological father). The
        separated Sole also lived in Madrid and worked clandestinely as a hair-stylist
        in her apartment. Their mutual elderly (Tia) Aunt Paula (Chus Lampreave),
        Irene's sister, was suffering with dementia and had remained in their
        Spanish village hometown of Alcanfor de las Infantas, in La Mancha, where
        she was helped by long-time family friend and neighbor Agustina
        (Blanca Portillo). Due to Paco's lascivious attempt to molest and rape
        Paula, she stabbed him to death, and Raimunda covered up the crime by
        hiding his body in a restaurant's freezer (and later depositing the freezer
        in a river). In a fanciful, strange and unusual mystical twist, after
        Sole returned home to attend Aunt Paula's funeral, it was confirmed for
        her by Agustina that Irene was alive and that her 'ghost' or spirit had
        reappeared. It also followed Sole back to Madrid. After being diagnosed
        with terminal cancer, Agustina also traveled to Madrid for hospital treatment.
        Both young Paula and Sole met the 'ghost' and became close to the spirit.
        It was then revealed that Irene had not died in a fire, but had indeed
        returned (Volver translated &quot;To Return&quot;) to comfort
        the family, reconcile and make amends with Raimunda, and care for Agustina.
        Startling and traumatic family secrets from the past were then
        unearthed to heal everyone -- Raimunda's father (Irene's husband) sexually
        abused her and fathered Paula, who was therefore Raimunda's daughter
        and sister. And the fire that supposedly killed Irene had been deliberately
        set by Irene after she found her cheating husband with another woman
        (Agustina's mother!), and afterwards, Irene went into hiding at her sister
         Paula's home where she was regarded by neighbors as Irene's returning
        'ghost.'</font></p>
