            Hawks</font><br />
                <font size="2">This classic Howard Hawks
                  film was often considered an adult version of the
                  legendary <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em> tale - and
                   was one of the last &quot;Golden Age&quot; screwball comedies.
                   Scriptwriters Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett adapted co-author
                   Wilder's own story &quot;From A to Z&quot; for the Samuel
                   Goldwyn-produced and RKO-distributed film. In the plot, a
                   group of eight, white-haired, conservative-minded, elderly
                   bachelor professors (&quot;squirrelly
                  cherubs&quot;) had been living and working together in the
                  same Manhattan home for nine years - engaged in a 12-year effort
                  to write-compile an encyclopedia or dictionary. Professor Bertram
                  Potts (Gary Cooper), a naive, innocent, pedantic, and square
                  linguist (or grammarian) and the youngest of the men, led the
                  group. Each scholar was a specialist in a particular discipline,
                  subject or study area, and was assigned to write articles based
                  upon their research. Their project was financed by rich investor
                  Miss Totten (Mary Field) and the   Daniel S. Totten Foundation,
                  who was  now insisting that the men finish their leisurely-paced
                  work as soon as possible. As the professors mostly worked in
                  seclusion in the orderly inner environment of the house, tended
                  by housekeeper Miss Bragg (Kathleen Howard), they were very
                  sheltered and unfamiliar with the outside world. During Potts'
                  research into the subject of &quot;Slang,&quot; he realized
                  that the article he was  working on was completely out-dated
                   and needed revision. This required him to leave the house
                  - he would be the only one to do so in nine years. In a
                nightclub, he listened to the singing performance of worldly,
                sexy, smart-mouthed and flirtatious singer-dancer Katherine &quot;Sugarpuss&quot;
                O'Shea (Barbara Stanwyck), a gangster's moll. Although she initially
                rejected his invitation to help in his linguistic research into
                slang (by visiting with him in the scholars' house), she was
                forced to agree when she found herself on the run from the law,
                and needed a place to hide. Sugarpuss had become a witness to
                 a murder committed by her mob boss boyfriend Joe Lilac (Dana
                Andrews). The presence of the vivacious and seductive Sugarpuss
                in the house completely disrupted progress on the encyclopedia,
                especially when she instructed the men to dance with her in a
                Conga line. Although she could help with the slang research,
                Potts asked her to leave since her sexiness threatened his work.
                She claimed she was in love with him: &quot;I
                  couldn't stop thinking about you after you left my dressing
                room,&quot; and she called him &quot;big and cute and pretty...to
                me, you're a regular yum-yum type.&quot; Also
                  admitting she was &quot;just plain wacky&quot; over him, she
                  proposed to show priggish Potts the meaning of &quot;yum-yum.&quot; First,
                  she had to elevate her height by standing on two reference
                  books: &quot;I'm gonna show you what yum-yum is. Here's yum.&quot; She
                  kissed him with her arms around his neck. Then,
                  she said: &quot;And here's the other yum&quot; (a second kiss),
                  followed by: &quot;And here's yum-yum.&quot; The force of the
                  third kiss caused them to topple backwards onto the floor.
                  Inevitably, Potts fell in love with Sugarpuss and proposed
                  marriage, while at the same time, Joe Lilac also schemed to
          marry her to keep her from testifying against him. In the film's zany
                   conclusion, the scholars cleverly and heroically out-witted
                  the gangsters sent to prevent them from interfering in Lilac's
                  forced marriage to Sugarpuss. She was rescued and the gang
                  of gangsters was captured, and Potts proved himself to her

                  Technicolored romance melodrama was adapted by Jo Swerling
              and based upon Vincente Blasco Ibanez's 1908 novel <i>Sangre y
                  Arena</i>. An earlier version of the novel was portrayed in
                  the silent film <i>Blood and Sand (1922)</i> starring Rudolph Valentino. The
                  1941 drama was intended as a follow-up film to the previous
                  hit film <i>The Mark of Zorro (1940)</i> a year earlier, with the same major
                   stars (it was the 4th and final film pairing Tyrone Power
                   with Linda Darnell). The film had two Academy Awards nominations
                   and won one Oscar (Best Cinematography). The storyline followed
                   the rise and fall of an illiterate peasant from the town of
                   Seville named Juan Gallardo (Rex Downing as child, Tyrone
                   Power as adult) who followed in his deceased father's footsteps
                   to become an acclaimed Madrid bullfighter. After achieving
                   fame and wealth in the bullring about a decade later, he returned
                   to his village to marry his aristocratic child sweetheart
                   Carmen Espinosa (Ann E. Todd as child, Linda Darnell as adult).
                   As Spain's greatest matador, he caught the eye of beautiful,
                   sultry temptress and socialite Dona Sol des Muire (Rita Hayworth
                   in a breakthrough role). His self-destructive, egotistical
                   downfall came during their affair when he neglected his pious,
                   long-suffering and faithful wife Carmen (and she left him),
                   and his decadent lifestyle also affected his training and
                   skills as a bullfighter. Rejected by his followers (and even
                   Dona Sol), when he tried to regain his fallen fame and popularity
                   in the bullring with one climactic fight, he was tragically
                   gored by the bull and died in Carmen's arms. In the background,
                   cheers erupted for up-and-coming brutish matador Manolo de
                   Palma (Anthony Quinn), Juan's childhood friend and Dona Sol's
                   new paramour, who was victorious over the bull. In response
                   to the crowd that had already forgotten Juan, Manolo expressed
                   his gratitude by bowing near the stain left in the sand by
                   Juan's blood. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Orson Welles<br />
            This was Orson Welles' unqualified masterpiece - a major movie milestone
            in cinematic history. It has often been considered by most film critics
            as the greatest of all-time, or one of the top ten films ever made.
            It rewrote the rules of Hollywood cinema, setting Hollywood on its
            ear when first released. The film was co-written, directed, and starred
            in by 25-year old radio star Orson Welles in his first film effort
            and on a bare-bones budget. It featured an acting cast from Welles'
            own Mercury Theater. It was famous for its innovative cinematic techniques,
            quick cuts, use of shadows to intensify the drama, limited close-ups
            when they were in style, deep-focus photography, and dissolves. Told
            in flashbacks with a multi-viewpoint, non-linear script, the story
            was the portrait of the public and private life of a newspaper publisher,
            loosely based on (and paralleling) the life of William Randolph Hearst.
            The last dying word of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane (Orson
            Welles), the mysterious &quot;Rosebud,&quot; sent
            reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) on a search for the meaning
            of the word and an understanding of the publishing giant's life.
            Kane built a publishing empire but ended up undone by his own excesses
            and obsessions, when he created a castle-like refuge (Xanadu) where
            he was alone.</font></p></td>

          Money Can Buy), </b>107 minutes, D: William Dieterle<br />
          This cautionary moral tale was faithfully based on Stephen Vincent Ben&eacute;t's
          1937 Faustian short story, with an Oscar-winning score by Bernard Herrmann.
          In 1840, poor, 27 year-old Cross Corners, New Hampshire farmer Jabez
          Stone (James Craig), a kind-hearted man, married for two years to Mary
          (Anne Shirley), was down on his luck. His family and shrewd and wise
          mother Ma Stone (Jane Darwell) faced eviction and were in debt to local
          loan shark Miser Stevens (John Qualen) - threatened with poverty and
            farm foreclosure. He idly offered to sell his soul for two cents
            to the jolly but ruthless Mr. Scratch (Walter Huston), aka The
            Devil or Satan (Mephistopheles). For seven years, Jabez would become
            financially prosperous and wealthy with lots of good luck (and
            &quot;all that money can buy&quot;), after which the Devil would
            take his invisible soul. Jabez found Hessian gold coins under the
            floor of his barn and immediately paid off his debts to Stevens,
            and became richer and richer (with the townsfolk owing him money
            as a fearsome land baron), but also became greedy and hard-hearted.
            Also, Scratch sent his bewitching and alluring live-in housemaid/nanny/temptress
            Belle (Simone Simon), callously driving off his wife Mary and newborn
            son. He also took up drinking
            and gambling. When 7 years was up, Jabez was given the option of
            giving up his son to save his soul - but he refused. He enlisted
            the aid of local hero and famous silver-tongued orator/politician
            Daniel Webster (Edward Arnold) to defend him - with a jury trial
            - to plead his case and win back his soul from an iron-clad contract.
          In the film's dramatic conclusion, the 12-person jury of the &quot;damned&quot; summoned
            by the Devil was composed of infamous cutthroats, brigands and
            traitors in American history, such as Benedict Arnold, who had
            previously sold their souls also. The judge was Justice John Hathorne
            (W.B. Warner) of the Salem witch trials, who refused cross-examination,
            and denied disqualification of the prejudiced jury. With eloquent
            oratory in the final moments, Webster gave an impassioned closing
            argument, which persuaded the jury and the court to turn against
          Mr. Scratch, destroy the contract, and have mercy on Jabez's soul.</font> </p>        </td>

                was the first of the Disney animated features to be released
                on videocassette (in 1981). It was a twist on the classic ugly
                duckling story, in its story about a shy little circus elephant
                named Dumbo. The baby pachyderm was criticized, ridiculed, and
                outcast for his ears which were big enough to fly with. He was
                separated from his mother, Mrs. Jumbo, when she was branded a
                mad elephant for defending him. He was befriended by circus mouse
                Timothy Mouse who built his confidence. Dumbo became the overnight

              D: Alexander Hall<br />
            This highly inventive comedy-fantasy film (with an Oscar-winning
            Original Screenplay) contained many plot twists and turns, and was
            similar in plot to <i>Angel on My Shoulder (1946)</i>. The 1941 film's
            sequel was <i>Down to Earth (1947)</i>, and it  was cleverly remade as the sports
            fantasy <i>Heaven Can Wait (1978)</i> with Warren Beatty as a football player, not
            a boxer. It was not to be confused with <i>Heaven Can
            Wait (1943)</i> starring Don Ameche and Gene Tierney. In the story,
             good-natured saxophone-playing prizefighter Joe Pendleton (Robert
            Montgomery), &quot;The Flying Pug,&quot; died in a plane crash in New Jersey 50
            years too early due to a heavenly screw-up. He was prematurely brought
            to heaven (he was supposed to survive the crash) by bumbling, inexperienced
            busybody Heavenly Messenger No. 7013 (Edward Everett Horton) for
            check-off by Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains). Because heaven had called
            him too soon, he was sent back to Earth to live out the remaining
            years allotted to him, occupying someone else's body. Escorted by
            Mr. Jordan back to Earth, the body he entered was that of  unscrupulous
            multi-millionaire playboy Bruce Farnsworth who had just been murdered
            by drowning in his bathtub by his scheming and greedy wife Julia
            Farnsworth (Rita Johnson) and his male secretary Tony Abbott (John
            Emery). The murderous pair were shocked and confused to see the deceased
            suddenly re-emerge from the bathroom. He also utterly befuddled his
            former fight manager Max Corkle (James Gleason), although was able
            to secretly reveal his soul's identity. Joe's/Farnsworth's reincarnated
            spirit fell in love with Bette Logan (Evelyn Keyes), the daughter
            of a man that Farnsworth had framed for securities fraud. Farnsworth
            trained with Max to enter a heavyweight championship boxing match against the reigning champ,
            when Joe/Farnsworth was again murdered by his secretary. Joe's/Farnsworth's
            replacement in the prize-fight with the champ was K.O. Murdoch. As
            the fight was about to begin, Murdoch, who had run afoul of the mob,
            was shot in the ring for betraying gamblers (by not &quot;throwing&quot;
          the fight). Joe's soul quickly took Murdoch's place, and awakened
            in Murdock's body lying on the floor of the ring. Joe, as Murdoch,
            defeated his opponent and won the title of world champ, with only
            Max realizing that Joe's soul was in Murdoch's body. Murdoch  lost
            his memory of his past life as Joe. In the
            conclusion, he was strangely drawn to Bette, even though they hadn't
            met.</font></p>          </td>

              D: Raoul Walsh<br />
          Raoul Walsh's landmark gangster film from Warner Bros. studios (with
           a script by John Huston adapted from the book by WR Burnett) was remade
          as a western titled <i>Colorado Territory (1949) </i>with Joel McCrea,
          and as <i>I Died a Thousand Times (1955) </i>with Jack Palance.
          It told about aging notorious gangster Roy &quot;Mad
              Dog&quot; Earle (Humphrey Bogart in his first lead role, although
              second-billed behind Ida Lupino). Pardoned after 8 years in prison,
              he was hired by his old  crime boss, Big Mac (MacBride), to help
              amateur cons plan and carry out the jewel heist of a California
              resort hotel - one final job. He met a runaway dance-hall girl
              named Marie (Ida Lupino), the girlfriend of one of the thugs nicknamed
              Babe (Alan Curtis), who eventually became his 'tarnished angel'
              friend. Before the robbery, he met a destitute grandfather (&quot;Pa&quot;)
              (Henry Travers) and club-footed Velma (Joan Leslie), and offered
              to pay for surgery to correct her disability. When he visited her
              after the successful operation, she rejected his marriage proposal
              (&quot;We can still be friends...&quot;), and he felt heartbroken and betrayed.
              Although the heist was successful, everything unraveled after a
              car crash, a cop was killed, and an inside connection squealed
              to police. In the conclusion, Earle was the target of a suspenseful manhunt high
              up in the Sierra Mountains as police pursued him in a doomed last
              stand. Marie  refused to call out to him as she told the authorities: &quot;He's
            gonna die anyway, I'd rather it was this way. Go on, all of you,
            kill him, kill him...&quot; Earle was shot dead from behind when
            he called out to his mongrel dog Pard. After he had been killed
            out in the open, a weeping Marie knelt over Earle's dead body,
            and asked an uncaring officer (who sarcastically called the dead
            man &quot;Big-shot Earle&quot; - &quot;Look
            at him lying there. He ain't much now, is he?&quot;): &quot;Mister,
            what does it mean when a man crashes out?&quot; When told that
            it meant being freed (&quot;It means he's free&quot;), she sadly
            repeated the word &quot;Free?&quot;, questioning Roy's unnecessary
            death. She picked up Pard as she was escorted away and said the
            word &quot;Free&quot; one more time. The film ended with a blurry
            fadeout on Marie's tear-stained face as it filled the frame before
            a pan up to the mountains.</font></p>          </td>

            This touching, moving soap-opera style melodrama from Ketti Frings'
             semi-autobiographical story was the last
            film written by Billy Wilder with his scripting partner Charles
            Brackett, before he embarked on his own directorial career. This
            was also the year that this film's star Olivia de Havilland was nominated
            as Best Actress, competing against her successful sister Joan Fontaine,
            also nominated for  <i>Suspicion (1941)</i> - the first time for
            a pair of siblings. The film's plot was told in flashback - in the
            preface, the main character visited Paramount Studios in Los Angeles
            to sell his hard-luck romantic story to director Dwight Saxon (Mitchell
            Leisen, the film's actual director), for  $500. An
            unscrupulous, hopeless Romanian refugee, dancer Georges Iscovescu
            (Charles Boyer) from oppressive war-ravaged Nazi Germany, was stranded
            in Tijuana, a Mexican border town in the Hotel Esperanza with a number
            of other hopeful immigrants to the US, stuck with a waiting period
            of five years. His plan to satisfy immigration officials, especially
            Inspector Hammock (Walter Abel), was to marry a US citizen to gain
            entry (requiring only four weeks for a visa). He met and married
            a lonely, shy, innocent, and trusting American schoolteacher Emmy
            Brown (Olivia de Havilland), who was visiting with her students on
            a school trip. Desperate to escape his situation, Iscovescu, a former
            gigolo, deceitfully lured the gullible Emmy into a quick matrimonial
            immigration scheme to merely gain entrance. His plan was to desert
            her after gaining entry, and link up with his old jealous girlfriend
            Anita Dixon (Paulette Goddard) from the Cote d'Azur who had also
            married an American to get into the US (and then had dumped him).
            But then, they both fell deeply in love with each other, evidenced
            by Georges crossing the border illegally when Emmy had a car accident
            and was hospitalized and unconscious in Los Angeles. [This was when
            Georges requested $500 in the preface, to be used to help Emmy.]
            Although Georges was arrested and brought back to Mexico, he was
            soon released to cross the border to be with Emmy.</font></p>        </td>

            Director Ford's film was derived from Richard Llewellyn's best-selling
            autobiographical novel about labor unrest, personal tragedy, the
            end to a way of life, and the power of the family. It was beautifully
            directed, vividly photographed, and performed, with a well-written
            screenplay, and was one of John Ford's masterpieces (for which he
            won his third Best Director Oscar). It was highly controversial though,
            because it won the Best Picture Academy Award over two superior classics: <i><a href="citi.html">Citizen
            Kane (1941)</a> </i> and <i><a href="malt.html">The
            Maltese Falcon (1941)</a></i>. In voice-over, the life of a Welsh coal mining town in the late 1800s
            and early 1900s was seen through the sensitive eyes of the youngest
            son Huw (Roddy McDowall) of the hard-working, close-knit Morgan family
            (with seven children), relating the story in flashback. Many memorable
            performances included the family's strict anti-union patriarch Gwillym
            Morgan (Donald Crisp) and matriarch Beth (Sara Allgood), and the
            noble-spirited beauty - the lovely unmarried 17 year-old daughter
            Angharad (19 year-old Irish actress Maureen O'Hara). Domestic life,
            romance, harsh treatment at school, the departure of two Morgan boys
            to find their fortune in America, unrequited love between the local
            preacher Mr. Gruffydd (Walter Pidgeon) and the only Morgan daughter,
            and other events (such as a labor dispute, and a devastating mine
            accident) were portrayed within the warm, human story.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Preston Sturges<br />
            Director Preston Sturges' classic, witty, romantic screwball comedy
            of the 1940s featured traditional fast-paced dialogue, farce, slapstick
            (actor Fonda's multiple pratfalls) and visual humor. Considered possibly
            as Preston Sturges' best film, it was a wonderful 'battle of the
            sexes' comedy. Con artist, swindler, and professional card shark
            Jean Harrington (Barbara Stanwyck), with her crooked father &quot;Colonel&quot; Harry
            Harrington (Charles Coburn) made their living by charming gullible
            multimillionaires out of their money. On board a luxury ocean liner,
            she selected her next victim, millionaire herpetologist/ophiologist
             Charles &quot;Hoppsy&quot; Pike (Henry Fonda), the socially-awkward heir to a brewery
            fortune, who had just returned from an expedition up the Amazon River.
            When he was set up, she ran into one difficulty - she fell 
            in love with her victim, but he found out about her ulterior motives
            before she could confess, and he dumped her. To get revenge for being
            coldly dropped, she posed with another identity - as an English aristocratic
            lady, Lady Eve Sidwich, and he fell in love with her all over again
            in front of his tycoon father Horace (Eugene Pallette) at the Pikes'
            Ridgefield, Connecticut mansion. She later extracted her revenge
            on their honeymoon on a speeding train.</font></p></td>

            Director Wyler's drama was adapted from Lillian Hellman's play (with
            assistance from others including Dorothy Parker), with fabulous cinematography
            (deep-focus) by the acclaimed Gregg Toland. It was followed by the

			It was the turn-of-the
            century story about a greedy, corrupt, and dysfunctional Southern
            family, the Hubbards, who attempted to build a factory on what was
            once a beautiful plantation. Brothers Ben (Charles Dingle) and Oscar
            (Carl Benton Reid) schemed to bring industry by building a cotton
            mill in their small southern town. But they needed the capital of
            their sister Regina's (Bette Davis) banker husband Horace Giddens
            (Herbert Marshall) in order to make the deal. The principled Horace,
            who was an invalid with a bad heart, wanted no part of their exploitative
            scheme despite Regina's requests. Regina's nephew Leo Hubbard (Dan
            Duryea), who worked in the bank, stole some bonds from Horace's
            safe-deposit box to make the deal work. Learning of the theft, the
            ruthless, manipulative and conniving Regina blackmailed her brothers
            into giving her a percentage of the business. Horace, however, foiled
            Regina's scheme when he informed her that he actually gave the money
            as an interest-free loan, and that he was changing his will in favor
            of their daughter Alexandra Giddens (Teresa Wright). Before he executed
            the change, he suffered a heart seizure and collapsed, and in a very
            bold and memorable scene, the heartless and avaricious Regina refused
            his pleas for help to get his medicine as he expired on the staircase.
            The cold-hearted Regina was left alone and deserted by her daughter. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: John Huston<br />
          This is one of the  greatest and earliest <i>film-noir</i> crime-detective
          mysteries of all-time. Director and scriptwriter John Huston's film
          version (his incredible directorial debut!) of author Dashiell Hammett's
          hard-edged and cynical detective novel was about greed and deceit,
          and a quest for a deceptive black bird (&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;).
          It was previously filmed, also by Warner Bros., as
          two lesser films: <i>The Maltese Falcon (1931) (aka Dangerous Female)</i>,
          with Bebe Daniels and Ricardo Cortez, and as director William Dieterle's <i>Satan
          Met a Lady (1936) </i>with William Warren and Bette Davis. And then
          it was poorly remade as Roger Corman's <i>Target: Harry (1969)</i>,
          and the comedy <i>The Black Bird (1975) </i>with George Segal. This version boasted superb
              moody images, a sinister atmosphere, a pace that accelerated as
              tension mounted, and an innovative <i>film noir</i> style. In
            the fast-paced B/W story, hard-boiled San Francisco sleuth/private
            eye Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) and his partner Miles Archer (Jerome
            Cowan) were approached in their 1940s San Francisco office and
            hired by pretty client &quot;Ruth Wonderly&quot; (Mary
            Astor) (an alias for her real name Brigid O'Shaughnessy, a treacherous
			 and deceptive <i>femme fatale</i>) to trail her that evening. 
			 She falsely claimed to them that a man
            named Floyd Thursby (entirely off-screen) had run off and eloped
			 with her younger sister and she wanted to locate her. That evening,
			 the dutiful Archer was shot dead at point-blank range, and it was
			 also reported shortly later by the authorities (by plainclothes
			 Police Sergeant Tom Polhaus (Ward Bond)), that Thursby had also
			 been killed - shot in the back. Had Spade retaliated in revenge
			 for his partner's death? [Note: Thursby was actually Brigid's partner
			 that she wanted eliminated.] Spade quickly became a murder suspect
			 due to his ongoing affair with Archer's wife Iva (Gladys George).
			 He found himself at the center of a great deal of attention by a
			 group of shady, unsavory characters, including Brigid, Fat Man Kasper
			 Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) and his henchmen: effeminate homosexual
			 Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) and hired baby-faced, dim-witted gunsel
			 Wilmer (Elisha Cook, Jr.). The group of murdering conspirators,
			 an international gang of crooks, were on an elusive search for a valuable &quot;black
            bird,&quot; a stolen jewel-encrusted Maltese Falcon statuette. Although
            Spade was lied to repeatedly by Brigid, he saw through her phoniness,
            but ended up drugged and knocked unconscious by Wilmer during his
            second interview with Gutman in his hotel suite. Afterwards, Spade
            acquired the statuette delivered to him in a package in his office
            by a dying Captain Jacobi (Walter Huston, John's father) of &quot;La
            Paloma&quot; that recently docked from Hong Kong. [Note: Jacobi had
            presumably been murdered by Wilmer, who had also killed Thursby.]
            Eventually, Spade brought together the uneasy alliance of self-interested,
            greedy falcon-seekers in his apartment, where he turned over the
            statue he had acquired from Jacobi - it turned out to be a fraudulent,
            lead counterfeit fake. Everyone but Brigid departed (while Spade
            reported Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer to the police, as they left to
            continue their search in Istanbul). In the film's denouement, a dramatic
            confrontation, Brigid confessed to Spade that she had murdered his
            partner Miles, using Thursby's stolen gun in order to implicate him.
            Spade insisted that Brigid must be punished for her crime, for ethical
            reasons: &quot;When a man's partner's killed, he's supposed to do something
            about it.&quot; He turned her over to the police, while sarcastically
            promising to be there when she was released, or to think of her if
            she was hanged. She was taken down in the enclosing cage of an elevator.
            Spade's parting words to Det. Sgt. Polhaus referred to the black
            bird: &quot;The stuff that dreams are made of.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Major Barbara (1941, UK)</b>, 131 minutes, D:
              Gabriel Pascal</font><br />
              <font size="2">Hungarian emigre producer/co-director Gabriel Pascal's
              social satire and sophisticated comedy about poverty, spirituality
              and wealth was based on the 1905 stage play of the same name by
              well-established playwright George Bernard Shaw. An earlier Shaw
              play adapted for the big screen was <i>Pygmalion
              (1938, UK)</i>. As he had done for <i>Pygmalion</i>, Shaw wrote
              the screenplay for the film (assisted by Anatole de Grunwald),
              and although changes were required to transition from the stage
              play to the film format, it basically retained the themes and structure
              of the original. The film's length was an issue, and Pascal's full
              2 hour and 11 minute version wasn't shown until years later. Problems
              with filming included budget and time constraints, censorship,
              and the ever-present threat of attack during the German blitzkrieg.
              Each of the three main characters embodied a certain ideal or perspective
              (in simple terms, religion, education, and commerce). The title
              character was self-righteous socialist 'Major Barbara' - a young,
              religious and naively-idealistic Barbara Undershaft (Wendy Hiller),
              who had joined the Salvation Army to save souls. She despised her
              estranged, more realistic and wealthy capitalist father Andrew
              Undershaft (Robert Morley), who was a weapons-armament industrialist-manufacturer
              during the war years. And thirdly, Professor Adolphus &quot;Dolly&quot; Cusins
              (Rex Harrison) was a young, elite scholar-intellectual and an ancient
              Greek history and literature specialist. Other members of Barbara's
              family in London included her aristocratic, high-society controlling
              mother Lady Britomart (Marie Lohr), her younger sister Sarah (Penelope
              Dudley-Ward), and her younger brother Stephen (Walter Hudd). Sarah's
              often-present engaged suitor in the household was Charles Lomas
              (David Tree). In the first basic half of the film, the charming
              Professor fell in love with Barbara during the course of her work
              when he first met her at one of her ministry meetings, and later,
              he became a Salvationist (mostly due to his love for her) and a
              member of the Army's band. Many of the saved souls at the Army's
              shelter admitted they were there for free food and housing. At
              the shelter, bullying Cockney non-believer Bill Walker (Robert
              Newton) beat up his teenaged girlfriend Jenny Hill (Deborah Kerr
              in her film debut), but was subdued and made to change his ways
              and seek forgiveness by Major Barbara's intervention. In the second
              half of the film, Andrew Undershaft unexpectedly donated 50,000
              pounds to the Salvation Army that was happily accepted by the Army's
              General (Sybil Thorndike). He also took Barbara on a tour of his
              weapons-plant, boasting  of how his benevolent capitalistic business
              improved and benefitted the lives of the common folk and all of
              mankind more than charity and faith. In protest to the tainted
              money, Barbara resigned. Searching for an heir to his empire, Andrew
              disowned his son Stephen (since he wasn't a &quot;foundling&quot;),
              adopted Cusins instead, and placed him in charge to direct his
              business. In the end, the disillusioned but converted Barbara with
              shattered beliefs had aligned herself and found an allegiance to
              her father's perspective and way of thinking.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Frank Capra<br />
            Frank Capra's (and scriptwriter Robert Riskin) dramatic,
            endearing, and poignant social/political commentary was the director's
             third Depression-Era populist melodrama - again a parable about
            an honest, common man's struggle against powerful corruptive forces,
            following after <i><a href="mrde.html">Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)</a></i> 
			and <i><a href="mrsm.html">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)</a></i>.
            Clever young reporter Ann Mitchell (Barbara Stanwyck) for <i>The
            Bulletin</i> (a NY newspaper in the midst of being sold) was threatened
            with being fired from her position by her new managing editor Henry
            Connell (James Gleason) due to her tame and undramatic
            columns. As a last desperate and manipulative act to keep her job,
            in her last published column, she created a fictional &quot;John
            Doe&quot; character to comply with her publisher's demands for content
            that would stimulate circulation during hard times. In a letter 
            to the editor, her &quot;Doe&quot; individual wrote that he was for
            the common man and little guy, but was so disgusted by powerful political
            corruption (and big money interests) that he was going to commit
            suicide by jumping off City Hall's roof on Christmas Eve. There was
            a lot of publicity, uproar and ruckus following the letter's publication
            (in the offices of the Governor (Vaughan Glaser), the Mayor (Gene
            Lockhart), the Chamber of Commerce and others) - while newspaper
            circulation dramatically improved. Ann's ploy worked very well as
            a publicity stunt for the time-being, but after she admitted to Connell
            that it was a phony letter to simply create &quot;fireworks,&quot;
               she was persuaded to continue writing &quot;John Doe&quot; letters to appeal
               to the masses. When the public's interest continued to take off,
               the paper had to save its image and find a bogus impersonator
               to be the real John Doe. They hired naive, plain-speaking, homeless
               and unemployed tramp, ex-baseball pitcher
          &quot;Long John&quot; Willoughby (Gary Cooper) with an injured arm
          who quickly became a national hero. John (aka John Doe) was joined
          by his vagrant, disdainful, and anti-social tramp companion who was
          simply named &quot;The Colonel&quot; (Walter Brennan) - he humorously
          and skeptically called compromised individuals
              &quot;heelots.&quot; Unwittingly, &quot;John Doe&quot;  became
              the manipulated tool of the paper's unscrupulous, and vicious publisher
              (of the newly-purchased metropolitan newspaper renamed <i>The New
              Bulletin</i>) - a corrupt, &quot;fascist&quot; 
			  and wealthy right-wing politician named D.
              B. Norton (Edward Arnold). To keep the scam going, &quot;John Doe&quot;
              was set up to deliver a 15-minute radio speech (scripted by Ann),
              to share his idealistic, philosophical, and populist maxims and
              thoughts about the values of the common person (&quot;the average
              guys&quot;). His words thoroughly resonated with listeners and followers who
              began to form &quot;John Doe&quot; Clubs country-wide - a potentially-powerful
              political force. Although Willoughby was soon disillusioned
              about being a fake and considered ending the hoax, he was encouraged
              to prevail by the words of Bert Hansen (Regis Toomey), a self-conscious
              soda jerk and his embarrassed but proud wife (Ann Doran), who told
          him how his message of 'love thy neighbor' had changed their lives.
              Norton was expecting to maximize the popularity of the John Doe
              Club movement to further his own political ambitions and the establishment
              of a police state. He had designs to manipulate an upcoming convention
              as an endorsement for his fascist party's run at the White House.
              In one of the film's most powerful scenes held at a rally during
              a rain storm (attended by over 20,000 'John Doe' followers in a
              ball park), 'John Doe' threatened to reveal the truth. Realizing
              that the John Doe movement was no longer of any use,
              Norton publically denounced Willoughby as a fraud. Completely defeated,
              Willoughby realized that the only way out was to actually commit
              suicide by jumping off City Hall. All of the main characters were
          brought together atop City Hall in the final dramatic sequence, to
              try to dissuade him from suicide. He listened to an hysterical
              Ann who admitted her love for him and begged and pleaded for him
              not to kill himself. But it was only after the encouraging
              words of Bert and other club members (&quot;the people&quot;) about
              their steadfast belief in him, that he decided to not go through
              with it. The final words of the film were Connell's retort to Norton: &quot;There
          you are, Norton! The people! Try and lick that!&quot; </font></p>        </td>

                  Break (1941)</a>,</b> 71 minutes, D: Edward F. Cline<br />
            This absurd, wacky film spoofed the film industry and Hollywood,
            with Fields in his last starring role in a feature-length film. It
            was a surrealistic film with no real plot, only a series of very
            funny scenes and bizarre sequences one after the other, to skewer
            the entire movie business. The Great Man (W. C. Fields), a film scriptwriter,
            attempted to get backing from a skeptical producer (Franklin Pangborn)
            at Esoteric Studios for a movie he wished to make about one of his
            highly improbable romantic adventures. He related the whole story
            in the hopes of getting financial support. He drunkenly fell out
            of an airplane, diving to retrieve his bottle of booze, and fell
             thousands of feet to the ground. He landed in a strange country
            named Ruritania in the mountain retreat of Mrs. Hemoglobin (Margaret
            Dumont). There, he met  attractive  Ouliotta Delight Hemoglobin
            (Susan Miller), who had never met a man - and he taught  
            her how to play &quot;Post Office.&quot; The
            producer threw the Great Man out of his office after listening to
            the absurd, impossible tale. The film concluded with a classic car
            chase scene - he drove an obese woman through downtown Los Angeles
            to the maternity hospital.</font></p></td>

              Irving Rapper<br />
            This wholesome, nostalgic, heartwarming, poignant and moving film
            was told episodically, and based on a biographical book written by
            Hartzell Spence, the son of the actual real-life minister. Although
            trained to be a doctor, William Spence (Fredric March) in the early
            1900s decided to quit his studies and devote himself to God and ministry.
            The Rev. Spence, now a devoted Methodist minister began his work
            in a small town in an Iowa community at the turn of the century.
            He moved from community to community over a period of years, building
            up the faith of troubled parishes. With his ever-faithful wife Hope
            Morris Spence (Martha Scott), they were forced to cope with the clash
            between fast-changing attitudes and church teachings.</font></p>        </td>

              Stevens<br />
          Director George Stevens' sentimental marriage (melo)-drama again paired
          Cary Grant and Irene Dunne for the third time after their popular appearances
           in <a href="awfu.html"><i>The
          Awful Truth (1937)</i></a> and <i>My Favorite Wife (1940)</i>. A preface
          or connecting element to each of the flashbacked episodic vignettes
          was the playing of a popular song on a Victrola phonograph to set the
          tone and bring back memories. Through flashbacks, the maudlin film
          followed the romantic courtship and married life of a couple (&quot;The
          Story of a Happy Marriage&quot;) - charming newspaperman and bachelor spendthrift
          Roger Adams (Best Actor-nominated Cary Grant) and his future wife Julie
          Gardiner (Irene Dunne). (&quot;You
          Were Meant For Me&quot;) In the film's opening, Julie was working in a NYC record shop where
          she and  Roger first met before dating. By New Years Day, Roger
          had impulsively proposed marriage to Julie after receiving an offer
          to work for two years in Japan. Following a hasty marriage and
            a quick goodbye scene at the train station, Julie couldn't leave
            him and remained in his train compartment (for a 45 minute honeymoon)
            until it was over 100 miles on its journey toward San Francisco.
            (&quot;Poor Butterfly&quot;) Three months later, a pregnant Julie
            joined Roger in Japan, where they rented a large house, and had hired
            a couple (with three children) to work and live there. After a very
            brief time  in Tokyo, Roger announced that they would be leaving
            Japan. He had received an inheritance of $10,000, and had decided
            to quit his newspaper job and travel around the world with Julie.
             Their plans did not work out, however - in 1923, a major earthquake
            damaged their house and severely injured Julie, who suffered a miscarriage,
            became barren, and was hospitalized in San Francisco. Julie
            recovered and Roger struck out on his own by purchasing a small newspaper
            in the small town (fictional) of Rosalia, CA, north of SF - <i>The
            Rosalia Weekly Courier Press</i>. They would both live in a two-story
            apartment (with living quarters upstairs - with a nursery - and an
            office downstairs); Roger also hired an old Brooklyn colleague named
            Apple Jack (Edgar Buchanan) as his printer and press manager. After
            a few years, the despondent, childless parents decided to adopt a
            child, and visited an adoption agency in San Francisco to meet with
            kindly case worker representative Miss Oliver (Beulah Bondi). They
            were told that the long waiting list meant they might not have an
            adoptee for a year. Roger exaggerated when asked during an investigation
            about his finances, and bragged that he made $100 dollars a week.
            After a waiting period, they brought home a five-week old adopted
            baby girl named Trina (Baby Biffie) for a year's probation, although
            at first Roger had stated that he preferred a two-year old boy with
            blue eyes, dimples and curly hair. However, he immediately fell in
            love with the baby. Adjusting to parenting for their first few nights
            was difficult - the flustered couple was exhausted after getting
            up all night to attend to the baby - they were nervous about keeping
            quiet, and also were uncertain about how to bathe and diaper the
            child until Apple Jack demonstrated for them. (&quot;My Blue Heaven&quot;)
            - a year later after the probation period ended, the matronly Miss
            Oliver arrived to see if the adoption could be permanently approved.
            Roger was forced to confess that he actually had no income when he
            was forced to close down the paper. In a scene before a judge (Wallis
            Clark), during an impassioned speech - the film's highlight, Roger
            movingly begged and pleaded for the official to grant them a continuation
          of the adoption, rather than cruelly return the child to the orphanage.
            Through his words, he was able to convince the judge to let them
             retain the custody of the child. (&quot;Silent
            Night&quot;) - six years later during Christmas, the two parents
            were faced some time after with the sudden and unexpected death of
            their six-year-old child Trina (Eva Lee Kuney) following a brief
            illness. As a result, the couple had become downtrodden and estranged
            to each other - and Roger wanted no reminders of his dead child and
            felt they should dissolve their marriage. The bereaving Mrs. Adams
            wrote a letter to the saddened Miss Oliver notifying her: (&quot;Since
              the night of Trina's death, we have been like strangers to one
              another. I don't know what to do. It seems as if there is nothing
              between us any more. I've tried to talk to him, but he does not
              wish to listen. He is punishing himself, not realizing that he
          is also punishing me&quot;). (&quot;You Were Meant For Me&quot;)
          - now in the present, the two guilt-ridden parents Roger and Julie
          were still essentially separated, and felt defeated in life. Unexpectedly,
                they received a phone call from Miss Oliver that another child
                - a two-year old boy, was being offered for adoption to them:
                (&quot;He's the exact image of the youngster you asked for when
                you first wrote to me. Do you remember? I have that old letter
                here in front of me now - 'Curly hair, blue eyes, dimples'. And
                this is strictly off the record, but really, another couple has
                the right to see him first, but he's such a remarkable baby that
            I thought perhaps you and Mr. Adams might take a look&quot;). The
            film ended on a hopeful and optimistic note - Julie responded with
            great anticipation that they wanted to adopt - and in the process
            restore their marriage: &quot;Please don't have that other 
		  couple see him until we do!&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Sea Wolf (1941)</b>, 100 minutes, D: Michael
              Curtiz<br />
          Director Michael Curtiz's brisk, film-noirish sea adventure drama was
          based upon author Jack London's 1904 classic literary novel (a &quot;GREAT
          NOVEL OF TERROR AFLOAT&quot;) - it was the fifth (and most memorable)
          film version after other versions in 1913, 1920, 1926, and 1930. Later,
          there were also two other related films:
                <i>Wolf Larsen (1958)</i> starring Barry Sullivan, and <i>The
                Sea Wolf (1997)</i> starring Stacy Keach. It featured a superb
                musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Screenwriter Robert
                Rossen's script provided an analogy between the film's allegorical
                title character and the war-time Fascist powers (Nazi's Hitler)
                that had adopted philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's theories regarding
                a 'superman' and a &quot;Master Race.&quot; In the opening of
                the film's rousing tale in the year 1900, a ferry collided with
                another vessel and sank, causing many of the passengers to drown.
                Two of the  survivors in the water: effete intellectual and altruistic,
                idealistic fiction writer Humphrey Van Weyden (Alexander Knox)
                and an escapee from the Lyndale Reformatory for Women - the smart
                and good-looking Ruth Webster (Ida Lupino), were brought on board
                a seal-hunting freighter known as the <i> Ghost</i> before departing 
				from San Francisco Bay. The sailing
                ship was helmed by malevolent, immoral, cold and evil &quot;Wolf&quot;
                Larsen (Edward G. Robinson) - a sadistic, abusive, domineering
                and crazed psychopath. The amoral Captain's Satanic credo for life
                was taken from John Milton's <i>Paradise
                Lost</i>: &quot;Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.&quot; Some
                of his callous, misfit, outcast and coarse crew members of the
                hellish pirate ship, shanghai'ed from the Barbary Coast, included:
                George Leach (John Garfield) - another fugitive from the law
                who had volunteered to work on the ship, a drunken
                and pathetic Doctor Louis Prescott (Gene Lockhart) and a cook
                nicknamed Cookie (Barry Fitzgerald). The two passengers (and
                crew) were held captive and suffered cruel and brutal treatment
                by Wolf. During the voyage, without his permission, Leach was
                volunteered to provide a blood transfusion for the ailing Ruth,
                to save her life. Before committing suicide by jumping from the
                mast, the desperate and ridiculed Dr. Prescott revealed the true
                mission of Larsen's vessel - it wasn't a seal-hunting vessel
                after all, but was sailing to avoid Larsen's vengeful sea-captain
                brother, known as &quot;Death&quot; Larsen,
                who was hunting him down. An attempted mutiny to escape from
                the ship was led by the rebellious Leach, but the plan failed
                when deterred by Wolf who quickly reclaimed authority. It was
                revealed that the tyrannical Captain often suffered from severe
                and debilitating headaches that caused seizures. He was keeping
                his ailment a secret from the crew that his headaches caused
                temporarily blindness. The Captain's brother &quot;Death&quot; Larsen
                caught up to the <i>Ghost</i> and attacked and damaged it. Van Weyden, Webster,
                and Leach had the opportunity to escape in a lightweight boat,
                but discovered that their water supply had been tainted with
                vinegar. Adrift in the fog, they believed that a ship had arrived
                to rescue them, but it was only the <i>Ghost</i> - now
            mostly destroyed by Larsen's enemy-brother. With no other option
                after being drawn back to the <i>Ghost</i>, the three reboarded
                the slowly-sinking vessel and found the nearly-insane Captain
                alone and blind. Larsen locked Leach in the supply storeroom,
                and then after a long discussion with Van Weyden about his predicted,
                upcoming &quot;mean, petty, and cheap&quot; death, he shot and
                mortally-wounded Van Weyden. To trick and outwit the blinded
                Larsen,  Van Weyden pretended that Larsen's shot had missed.
                He self-sacrificially bargained to exchange his life for Leach's
                 and agreed to remain in Larsen's company as the ship went down.
                Larsen agreed to release Leach from the storeroom, and he and
                Ruth were freed to escape together and row to a nearby deserted
                island. Meanwhile, Van Weyden - who had known that he would soon
                succumb to his lethal wounds, crumpled over dead. Larsen knew
                that he had been tricked, but gloated that he had successfully
                shot Van Weyden. He stood defiantly as the waves crashed in and
                enveloped him and his ship, and took him to his death. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Sergeant York (1941), </b>134 minutes, D: Howard
              Hawks<br />
            Director Howard Hawks' true, inspirational, but unusual biographical
            (biopic) story of the Great War's biggest war hero (Alvin York) was
            the highest grossing film of the year. It was a sensitive, affecting,
            and compassionate portrayal of York with fast-paced action sequences
            and some wartime propagandizing (as the US was becoming more involved
            in WWII). The war film was heightened by Max Steiner's effective
            musical score. The authentic war saga offered a portrait of poor,
            hell-raising mountain boy and sharp-shooting farmer Alvin C. York
            (Best Actor-winning Gary Cooper) living in the backwoods Tennessee
            Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf before the US' entrance into
            the Great War in Europe in 1916. His hot-headed brawling and drunken
            life in Pall Mall changed when he fell in love with local, teenaged
          Gracie Williams (Joan Leslie). Although attracted to Alvin,
              when he asked for her hand in marriage, she rejected him:   (&quot;I
              wouldn't have you on a Christmas tree, Alvin York! Hmm, fine husband
              you'd make!...Folks say you're no good except for fightin' and
              hell raisin' and I'm thinkin' they're plumb right&quot;). To impress
              her, and to steal her away from a rival suitor, Zeb Andrews (Robert
              Porterfield), the determined Alvin worked hard to buy some farming
              bottomland for them sometime in the future, as he promised: (&quot;There
              ain't nothin' I can't get if I set my mind to it&quot;).      
               Later, when he sought revenge for being cheated out of
              some bottomland, an angered and bitter Alvin had a life-changing
              religious experience signaled by a bolt of lightning during a thunderstorm.
              As he was riding along on muleback, a flash of lightning struck
              closeby, and he awoke on the ground after being thrown off. He
              noticed that his mangled rifle (with a split barrel) had served
              as a lightning rod and had saved his life.   The
              Great War progressed and by mid-1917, Alvin refused to register
              for the draft after he had become deeply religious and pacifistic.
              He vowed to Pastor Rosier Pile (Walter Brennan): (&quot;I ain't
            a-goin' to war. War is killin', and the book's agin' killin! So war
            is agin' the book!&quot;); his request to register as a conscientious
            objector (CO) was denied, and he was reluctantly drafted into military
            service after all appeals failed. After a tearful goodbye to Gracie,
            York was trained at Camp Gordon in Georgia, and impressed his superiors
            with his great marksmanship by hitting five consecutive bulls-eyes.
            In a crossroads about the direction of his life, he returned home
            for a brief leave of absence, where on a rock ledge, he read
             the Biblical passage in Matthew: &quot;Render unto Caesar the things
            that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.&quot; He
            decided to accept a promotion to the status of Corporal, and was
            shipped out to Europe to the war front. York heroically fought in
            the Great War during many fast-paced action scenes, including tracking
            shots of York's scramble through no-man's land. Most famously in
            the Battle of the Argonne Forest in 1918, Sgt. York (almost single-handedly)
            killed about 25 Germans (some were in a machine gun nest) to save
            his comrades - by using the tactic of sneaking up on them from behind
            and picking them off from the rear first: &quot;Just like a flock
            of turkeys.&quot;
            He also forced a white-flag truce and captured a large regiment of
            132 German soldiers, but he also became very disheartened by the
            ambush-killing of his best friend &quot;Pusher&quot; Ross (George
            Tobias), a Bronx NY subway guard, who died from a grenade blast at
            close range thrown by one of the captured Germans. York became the
            most decorated soldier of the war both in France and US, and was
            lauded by Gen. John J. Pershing, the leader of the AEF (American
            Expeditionary Forces), and received numerous medals of honor. Upon
            his return to the US, he was greeted with a ticker-tape parade in
            NYC, the key to the city, and numerous temptations of wealth and
            fame, and was assailed with offers by merchandizers to promote their
            products and make public appearances, but he refused to profit from
            serving his patriotric duty. He soon chose to return to his Tennessee
            roots, where he received a major homecoming welcome, and to his surprise,
            he was gifted farmland and a house on 200 acres of prime bottomland

              minutes, D: Preston Sturges<br />
            Director Sturges' landmark, classic Hollywood satire and social
            comedy was thought by many to be his greatest film.
            A successful yet naive Hollywood film director John L. Sullivan (Joel
            McCrea), known for making lightweight, trite movies (musicals and
            comedies), became disgruntled. He decided to research his next &quot;message&quot; picture
            to be titled &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; - one that would
             be more socially worthwhile and meaningful, by leaving Hollywood
            disguised in hobo's clothing with only ten cents in his pocket. He
            nomadically set off cross country for new material for his next movie
            - about how the common people were experiencing the Great Depression,
            so that he had a fresh, first-hand experience of the dark days of
            suffering. He was joined by a job-seeking, would-be,
            disenchanted and nameless starlet  dubbed
            The Girl (Veronica Lake) to encounter the common people during a
            tour and journey across America. Only when Sullivan, after  failed
            attempts to shake off the publicity-seeking studio, experienced real
            poverty, loss of his name and memory, and his freedom, did he begin
            to understand the plight of his beaten companions. After he viewed
            a Disney  cartoon (<i>Playful Pluto</i>) in a brutal work camp where
            he had been sentenced to a 6-year term for an assault of a rail-yard
            boss, he discovered the real value of laughter. In the film's plot
            twist, to escape from the prison farm, Sullivan made a false
        confession to his own murder in order to be recognized in pictures printed
            in newspapers - the ploy worked; his studio and friends realized
            he was still alive, and he was safely returned
            to Hollywood. There, he was reinvigorated to continue making comedies
            that would lift people's spirits.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Suspicion (1941),</b> 99 minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
            British director Alfred Hitchcock's release of this  romantic and
                suspenseful classic thriller was based upon the 1932 novel 'Before
                the Fact' by Francis Iles. The film ended up being puzzling,
                after Hitchcock was forced to alter the film's ending following
                preview showings. He had to change the film's basic themes and
                plot points that the husband was guilty of murdering his own
                wife - the heroine. The revised film made a significant switch
                - it only appeared that the husband was guilty, due to circumstances,
                and the wife survived. After its release, Joan
                Fontaine won the Best Actress Academy Award - it was the sole
                Oscar win for an actor in a Hitchcock film. [Note: Some thought
                it was a consolation prize for Fontaine's loss  the previous
                year for <i><a href="rebec.html">Rebecca
                (1940)</a></i>.  In 1941, Fontaine was in Academy Award competition
            with her own sister Olivia de Havilland, nominated for <i>Hold Back
            the Dawn (1941)</i>.] The loving but shy, inexperienced, matronly
            and repressed English heroine Lina McLaidlaw (Joan Fontaine) was
            introduced as the prim, over-protected, sheltered, spinsterish daughter
            of stuffy, wealthy, retired General McLaidlaw (Cedric Hardwicke)
            and his respectable wife Mrs. McLaidlaw (Dame May Whitty). Once the
              bespectacled wallflower Lina met handsome, suave, charming, playboyish
              Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant), he romanced her, and lovingly called
            her &quot;monkeyface.&quot; She hopelessly fell in love with him, although
            her parents disapproved of Aysgarth as a scoundrel and opportunist
              with a womanizing, fortune-hunting reputation. Blindly in love,
            and after an unusual courtship, she assented to a request to be married,
            even though Lina knew very little about him and his background. After
            eloping and a whirlwind honeymoon and romance, Johnny began to reveal
            his true self - he was shown to be an irresponsible cad, a dishonest
            liar, and a thief. In addition, he was financially-broke (with no
            employment or income). Johnnie was pressured to take a job after
            he learned that Lina's monthly-income couldn't support the two of
            them. He took a position with a distant, obscure cousin Captain Melbeck
            (Leo G. Carroll), as an agent to help manage estates. It was soon
            revealed that Johnnie had gambled on horse-racing with the money
            he earned, and then pawned off two McLaidlaw family heirlooms (antique
            chairs) to pay off his racing-gambling debts. Lina began to unearth
            clues and discovered that Johnnie had criminally-embezzled 2,000
            pounds from his employer and was discharged from the job, but never
            told her. She began to seriously consider leaving Johnnie and breaking
            up their marriage. Lina's fears intensified when notified by telegram
              that her father had died, and Johnnie was very disappointed that
          Lina had not inherited his fortune. One evening, the increasingly-suspicious
            and untrusting Lina was playing anagrams with Johnnie and his jovial,
              naive, past school friend and drinking buddy &quot;Beaky&quot; Thwaite
              (Nigel Bruce). Beaky was also Johnnie's prospective business partner
              for a highly-speculative land development scheme. During the game,
              the word &quot;MURDER&quot; was formed and Lina fell faint to the
              floor. She fearfully concluded that Johnnie might be conspiring
              to murder his friend, as another means to restore his finances.
              She had a visionary premonition that Johnnie pushed his friend
              from a cliffside (a prophetic and haunting image that would resurface).
              During conversation over dinner, juxtaposed with
                the slicing and cutting of Cornish game hens, the subject of
                talk was murder. Lina also remained tense due to learning about
                Johnnie's obsession with reading murder mystery novels, and talking
                about the use of untraceable poisons, including using brandy
            as a murder weapon. Soon after, Beaky was found dead in Paris under
              mysterious circumstances (he was allergic to brandy) - and Johnnie
              was considered the prime suspect for murdering him, due to his
          lying to authorities about his whereabouts. Lina
          was driven to psychosomatic illness and became bed-ridden due to her
          distrust and fear of her husband. She fearfully learned, with mounting
          tension as the film progressed, that he could benefit from her death
          via collecting on a payoff from her life insurance policy.  The shadows
          from the skylight in the front hall cast a giant spider-web appearing
          to trap Lina. In  the film's most famous and suspenseful sequence,
                at bedtime, Johnnie carried a glowing glass of milk (that may
                or may not have been fatefully poisoned) upstairs to his sick
                wife Lina while taking care of her - she stared at the glass
                with dread (and left it untouched) - believing that she was about
                to be poisoned. Was Johnnie truly devious and villainous, or
            was it solely a conspiratorial thought in her fragile mind? In the
          film's climactic conclusion, Johnnie insisted on driving Lina to her
          mother's place. He drove recklessly on the treacherous, twisty cliffside
          drive, when Lina's passenger door unexpectedly opened up and there
          was a struggle as he lunged toward her with unclear intentions - was
          he about to push her from the vehicle, or to grab onto her and save
          her? Ultimately, Johnnie stopped the car and helped rescue Lina. She
          barely escaped death. in the film's denouement (a studio-modified ending,
              making it a disappointing and contrived finale with a happy ending),
          Johnny confessed to Lina that he had chosen to end his life - he had
          become interested in poisons because he was imminently planning to
          commit suicide (with an untraceable poison), to escape life's insurmountable
          responsibilities and the challenges he faced (charges of embezzlement
          and murder). He was also resolved to spend his life in prison. He told
          her that when Beaky died, he was in Liverpool, trying to borrow money
          from Lina's life insurance policy to repay his ex-employer Melbeck.
          Lina apologized for her constant suspicions and doubts, and the couple
          resolved to stay together, help each other, and reconcile. However,
          could all of Johnnie's assertions be trusted and believed, given his
          past record of falsifying the truth?</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>That Hamilton Woman (1941, UK),</b> 128 minutes,
              D: Alexander Korda<br />
            Director Korda's touching, poignant and sadly beautiful costume drama
            was reportedly Winston Churchill's favorite film. It was a realistic,
            historical portrayal of the ill-fated, tragic romance between England's
            famous Naval Commander/hero Lord Admiral Horatio Nelson (Laurence
            Olivier) and Lady Emma Hart Hamilton (Vivien Leigh), portrayed by
            two married stars who also had an affair while married to other spouses.
            The story was told in flashback by a drunken cellmate, the former
            Lady Hamilton. She was a beautiful, vivacious and intelligent woman
            of poor, common origin - a dance hall girl. She had raised herself
            up to become an unloved &quot;trophy&quot; wife of the 
			British ambassador to the court of Naples, Sir
            William Hamilton (Alan Mowbray) in 1786. Seven to eight years later,
            Lady Hamilton met the dashing Nelson when he again visited Naples
            to ask for the king's support in the fight against Napoleon - and
            soon Nelson was victorious in the British war in Egypt against the
            French. When he returned as a wounded Admiral, they fell passionately
            in love - and she took care of him when he was exhausted and in poor
            health (he lost an arm and eye in battle). Sir Hamilton allowed their
            affair occur. But their love was continually thwarted because Lord
            Nelson was married to a stern and unforgiving Lady Nelson (Gladys
            Cooper). When Sir Hamilton died, he left his inheritance to his nephew,
            leaving Lady Hamilton penniless. Lord Nelson asked his wife Lady
            Nelson for a divorce so that he could marry the pregnant Emma, but
            she refused. The couple were able to defy gossipers by setting up
            housekeeping (with their child) for a few years in the English countryside
            cottage. Emma encouraged Nelson to resume military command against
            Napoleon's fleet, and although the British forces were victorious at
            the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, he was mortally wounded when fatally
            shot on board his flagship <i>HMS Victory</i>. As a result, Emma
            was again left destitute. </font></p>          </td>

              Waggner<br />
            One of the last of Universal's great monster films was this classic
            horror film -  a tense, well-made, and eerie production. This
            film spawned many sequels with Lon Chaney, Jr. continuing in the
            role with which he would always be identified - the wolfman. Star
            Lon Chaney, Jr. would eventually star in a total of five werewolf
            films from 1941 to 1948. It was also remade as <i>The
            Wolfman (2010)</i> starring Benicio del Toro. Easy-going, innocent
            British heir Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) returned to Wales
            after 18 years absence to the castle-mansion of his father Sir John
            Talbot (Claude Rains) after an education in America. When he visited
            an antiques shop and fell in love with its pretty shopkeeper Gwen
            Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers), the daughter of the shopowner, he purchased
            a rare silver-topped, wolf-headed cane with a pentagram design -
            a symbol of the werewolf. Shortly after, at a gypsy festival attended
            by Larry, Gwen, and Gwen's girlfriend - beautiful young Jenny Williams
            (Fay Helm), Jenny had her palm read by traveling gypsy fortune-teller
            Bela (Bela Lugosi). Nearby was his mother Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya),
            another gypsy sorceress - and the results were alarming (the
            image of a pentagram) - meaning she would be the werewolf's next
            victim. Then, Talbot was bitten in the chest by a ravenous, hairy
            werewolf (also Bela Lugosi) when he attempted to save Jenny from
            being attacked on the foggy moors. When the police investigated,
            they only discovered the bodies of Jenny and Bela (who had been beaten
            to death by the silver-topped cane that Larry used as a weapon) -
            there was no werewolf corpse. Much later during a second visit to
            the encampment dwelling of Bela's gypsy mother Maleva  informed
            Larry that the bite was from no ordinary wolf - he had been bitten
            by a werewolf, and at each new full moon, he was now condemned like
            her son was. Larry was in disbelief and became incensed: &quot;You're
            insane! I tell you, I killed a wolf! A PLAIN, ORDINARY WOLF!&quot;</font> <font size="2">A
            few moments later as he was walking out of the festival, Larry confessed
            to Gwen (who was alone after a quarrel with her fiancee Frank Andrews
            (Patric Knowles)) what the old gypsy woman had told him: &quot;She
            said that I was a werewolf.&quot; As a result of being bitten by Bela,
            during an amazingly-effective transformation scene in Talbot Castle
            (when the moon was full) (filmed with a series of lap dissolves),
            Larry was transformed into a blood-thirsty, furry bipedal creature,
            whose first victim was a local villager - gravedigger Richardson
            (Tom Stevenson). The next morning (Sunday), Talbot transformed back
              into human form, suffering from amnesia without any recollection
            of the previous night, although he noted wolf tracks into his castle
            bedroom. During Larry's second transformation 
            into werewolf form, he became caught and ensnared in one of the wolf-traps
            set by a hunting party. He was saved when Maleva's magical sorceress
            spell or chant brought him back to human form. Feeling doomed as
            a werewolf, Larry decided to leave town permanently. He awakened
            Gwen in her upstairs bedroom at the shop, and told her he had to
            leave. He became even more fearful and fled when he
          saw the fabled pentagram in the palm of her hand - a sign that she
          would definitely be his next victim. In the final moments of the film,
            an atmospheric, exciting climax in fog-shrouded woods/swamp (during
            the full moon), Talbot's father Sir John (with the cane) joined a
          search party. Gwen ignored warnings given
            to her by Maleva, and went deep into the woods to find Larry, where
            the werewolf stalked after her and attacked; Sir John heard her screams
            and came to her rescue; the beast was bludgeoned to death with Larry's
             silver-tipped cane, ending the man's suffering. Maleva repeated
            her incantation to revert the werewolf's body back to human form:
            (&quot;The
            way you walk is thorny...Your suffering is over. Now you will find
            peace for eternity&quot;).
            Larry was praised by Chief Constable Montford (Ralph Bellamy) as
            Gwen's heroic rescuer: </font><font size="2">&quot;The
            wolf must have attacked her and Larry came to the rescue. I'm sorry,
            Sir John.&quot; </font><font size="2">In the depressing conclusion,
            Sir John looked on in horror, realizing that he had slain his own
            son; Gwen cried out &quot;Larry!&quot; as she collapsed into the
            arms of her fiancee Frank.</font></p>
