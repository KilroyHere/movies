              Sidney<br />
              MGM's Technicolored, Best Picture-nominated lightweight fluffy
              musical in the post-war years headlined a young and thin
              Frank Sinatra who crooned Julie Styne-Sammy Cahn tunes, and also
              featured energetic Best Actor-nominated Gene Kelly (his sole Oscar
              nomination in his career) in a star-making role. It was the stars'
              first of three film pairings as a musical comedy team - and similar
              to Kelly's and Sinatra's later &quot;sailor-buddy&quot; film 
              <i>On the Town (1949)</i>. The lively musical, with an Oscar-winning
              Best Musical Score, featured two sailors: experienced &quot;Pomeranian
              sailor&quot; and lothario - Gunner's Mate 2nd class Joseph &quot;Joe&quot;
              Brady (Gene Kelly) and his best friend - the innocent, shy and
              naive Brooklynite - Seaman First Class Clarence Doolittle (Frank
              Sinatra). They were on a 4-day shore leave from their ship <i>Knoxville</i> in
            San Diego, and the two traveled north to Los Angeles (Hollywood)
              looking for love connections. They met up with straitlaced, widowed,
              aspiring opera singer Susan &quot;Susie&quot; Abbott (Kathryn Grayson)
              who worked as a film extra, and was befriending her young, orphaned
              9 year-old runaway nephew Donald Martin (Dean Stockwell in his
              film debut) who wished to join the Navy. Some of the tunes included
              Sinatra's Oscar-nominated &quot;I Fall in Love Too Easily&quot; and
            &quot;What Makes the Sunset?&quot;, and Kelly's seamless,  live-action
              magical dream dance with scene-stealing animated mouse Jerry, 
            the character from MGM's &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons, in 
            &quot;The King Who Couldn't Dance (The Worry Song)&quot;  number.
              Susan sang &quot;Jalousie&quot; (or &quot;Jealousy&quot;) and &quot;(All
              of a Sudden) My Heart Sings.&quot; In the continuation of the story,
               the bashful Clarence fell hard for Susan, and Joe, who was chasing
              after actress/girlfriend Lola (never seen) at the time, helped
              him by promising to introduce Susan to her idol -- MGM music producer
              and famed orchestra maestro-conductor Jos&eacute; Iturbi (Himself)
              - without really knowing him. However, a love triangle developed
              when Joe also began to have feelings for Susan (and she eventually
              did have an opportunity to audition with Iturbi), while Clarence
              met a more suitable, down-to-earth Brooklynite native match (Pamela
              Britton in her film debut, credited as Girl From Brooklyn and nicknamed &quot;Brooklyn&quot;),
              a friendly Olvera Street Mexican restaurant waitress.</font></p>          </td>

              N-----s, UK),</b> 97
              minutes, D: Rene Clair<br />
              Agatha Christie's best-selling 1939 detective novel (originally
              known as <i>Ten
              Little N-----s</i>)
              about ten houseguests, and subsequently performed as a stage play,
              from which this film was developed. This was the best-ever, most
              entertaining version of the Agatha Christie mystery - the black
              comedy/mystery story was remade and refilmed numerous times, including
              George Pollock's <i>Ten Little Indians (1965, UK)</i>,
              Peter Collinson's <i>Ten Little Indians (1974)</i>, and Alan Birkinshaw's <i>Ten
              Little Indians (1989, UK)</i>, but this was the original. It served
              as the basis for the cult satire <i>Murder By Death (1976)</i>.
              Eight individuals, strangers to each other, were invited to a forbidding
              house on an isolated island off the coast of Devon, England - the
              mansion was owned by the absent Mr. and Mrs. Owen, but their newly
              hired servants, butler Thomas (Richard Haydn) and cook Ethel Roberts
              (Queenie Leonard) were in attendance. Each of the 10, accused of
              having caused the death of others and escaping punishment, were
              eliminated. [Note: All of the murders were inspired by the Irish
              children's nursery rhyme song <i>Ten Little Indians</i>, 
			  (&quot;Ten little nigger boys went out to dine; One choked his little self
              and then there were Nine...&quot;).] - the film's sole clue. The
            mysterious &quot;Mr. U.N. Owen&quot; (read as &quot;Mr. Unknown&quot;)
            had created the remote Indian Island deathtrap. One by one, the
            guests started dying (off-screen) - by poisoning, drug overdose,
            stabbing, axing, by a hypodermic needle, a shot to the head, death
            by a crushing load of bricks, etc. The terminally-ill, wise and retired
            Judge Francis J. Quinncannon (Barry Fitzgerald), one of the guests,
            was revealed as the perpetrator of the killings - and identified
            as the enigmatic Mr. Owen. Quinncannon had faked his own death (bullet
            hole in the head) with the help of one of the unsuspecting victims,
            disgraced alcoholic doctor Dr. Edward Armstrong (Walter Huston),
            who he then killed. At film's end, Quinncannon offered surviving
            guest Vera Claythorne (June Duprez), a secretary, the option of hanging
            herself with a noose rather than waiting to be hanged publically.
            Then, he committed suicide by swallowing poisoned whiskey. Only two
            guests - who were not guilty of a hidden crime - managed to survive:
            Vera (who had confessed to a crime committed by her sister - the
            murder of her fiancee) and dashing adventurer-explorer Philip Lombard
            (actually his real name was Charles Morley) (Louis Hayward) who had
            attended in place of his friend Lombard who had committed suicide
            when threatened by Owen.</font></p>        </td>

        32 minutes, D: John Huston (uncredited)<br />
        This was a vivid documentary short from writer/director John Huston,
        who also served as the uncredited narrator. It was part of executive
        producer Frank Capra's &quot;Why We Fight&quot; series, but considered anti-war
        in tone, and the US Army refused to show it in its full footage format
        of 90 minutes (it was cut down to about 30 minutes). The documentary
        was a gritty and blunt portrayal of the December 1943 bloody battle of
        the 5th Army's attack on the small Italian village of San Pietro in the
        rocky Liri Valley 40 miles SE of Rome - the reality of the fighting was
        intensified by hand-held cameras. The location was crucial - it blocked
        Allied forces from advancing forward during an Italian campaign toward
        Rome. For about two months, there was heavy fighting against the German
        stronghold in the village, as over 1,100 valiant US soldiers (composed
        of a team of Texas Rangers and the 143rd Infantry Regiment of the 36th
        Division) were killed during the conflict. 12 of sixteen supporting tanks
        were lost in the initial assault, and 1,100 troop replacements were required.
        Afterwards, Italian peasants were thankful and grateful for being liberated. </font></p>        </td>

              D: Leo McCarey<br />
              This sprightly, entertaining, family-oriented (holiday favorite)
              and sentimental sequel to Paramount Pictures' Best Picture- and
              Best Director-winning<i> Going
              My Way (1944)</i> was  a major box-office hit - it ended up being
              the most profitable picture in the history of RKO Studios. It was
              the first sequel to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best
          Picture. Along the way, likeable crooner Bing
          Crosby sang &quot;Adeste Fidelis&quot; and &quot;The Bells of St. Mary's&quot;  with
          a children's choir, and he soloed with  &quot;O Sanctissma,&quot; &quot;Aren't
          You Glad You're You,&quot; and &quot;In the Land of Beginning Again.&quot; In
            the musical drama, modern-minded (progressive) and warm-hearted priest
              Father Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; O'Malley (Oscar-nominated Bing
              Crosby reprising his earlier Oscar-winning Best Actor performance)
              was assigned to minister in a NYC parish with a Catholic parochial
              elementary school attached named St. Mary's Academy. He soon
              found himself in a good-natured rivalry and conflict with the rules-oriented,
              stubborn and headstrong Swedish-American Sister Mary Benedict (Ingrid
              Bergman, the Best Actress winner from the previous year) - of the
              adjoining elementary school. [Note: Her character replaced Barry
              Fitzgerald's role in the previous 1944 film.] The inner-city school
              was run-down and about to be condemned, and could possibly be shut
              down. It was threatened with being demolished by a greedy neighboring
              land owner who wanted to rebuild the area. In a series of episodic
              events, behind the scenes, O'Malley helped to convince penny-pinching,
              cranky, wealthy neighboring land-developer-businessman Horace Bogardus
              (Henry Travers) to donate his under-construction structure as a
              new addition to the school, rather than purchase the crumbling
              school for use as a parking lot. The benefactor Bogardus was cleverly
              convinced to have a change of heart and donate his soon-to-be-completed modern office building
              next to the school. At Christmastime,  the younger St. Mary's students
              were rehearsing a very revised, staged Nativity pageant, including
              a chorus of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; (for the Virgin Birth). In
              a series of other episodic events, O'Malley (often with Sister
              Mary's assistance) also helped educate the children with unconventional
              methods, solve family problems, and improve life for everyone.
              In one case, Sister Mary taught one of the
            young boys, Eddie Breen (Richard/Dickie Tyler) to learn to box in
            order to defend himself against school bullies. In another, the
            two helped one of the boarding students - troubled teenaged daughter
              Patricia 'Patsy' Gallagher (Joan Carroll) of single mother Mary
              Gallagher (Martha Sleeper) of Syracuse, NY to be allowed to graduate
              from the 8th grade (even though she purposely failed her exams,
              in order to stay in the school rather than be sent back home).
              Their broken family was also reunited with the missing musician-husband-father
              Joe Gallagher (William Gargan) who walked out on them years earlier
              after Patsy's birth. In addition to the main plot, Sister Mary
            was kept in the dark about a diagnosis of an early stage of tuberculosis
            by Dr. McKay (Rhys Williams), and she presumed it was because of
              her frequent arguments and disagreements with O'Malley, and his
              request to get rid of her. When O'Malley decided to tell her the
              real reason for being transferred and sent away to a desert state
              to recover, she was relieved and joyful, and became resolved to
              restore her health, and return with added vigor and strength to
              see her dream of a new school come true. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Body Snatcher (1945)</b>, 78 minutes, D: Robert
              Wise<br />
            Writer Robert Louis Stevenson's 1884 short story of the same name
                was the basis for this RKO horror-thriller from director Robert
                Wise, who later became famous for such classics as <a href="dayearth.html"><i>The
                Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)</i></a>, <a href="wests.html"><i>West
                Side Story (1961)</i></a>, and <a href="soun.html"><i>The
                Sound of Music (1965)</i></a>. This was also the last of producer
                Val Lewton's great horror films - one of many that created a
                spooky and frightening atmosphere of tension. The story was based,
                in part, on a series of murders in 1828 (in Edinburgh, Scotland)
                committed by William Burke and William Hare over a period of
                ten months, who provided cadavers for Scottish anatomist and
                ethnologist Robert Knox. In the plot set
                in 1831, two &quot;resurrectionist&quot; body snatchers: cab driver and
                grave-robber John Gray (Boris Karloff) and his servant Joseph
                (Bela Lugosi), were assisting Dr. Wolfe &quot;Toddy&quot; MacFarlane's
            (Henry Daniell) illicit activities. [Note: MacFarlane's mentor was
            the notorious Dr. Knox.] They were illegally supplying MacFarlane's
            medical school with bodies for dissection, organ or body replacement
            surgeries, and anatomy lessons. They profited by selling the
            corpses - sometimes necessitating the murder of victims. Due to the
            heavily-guarded cemetery due to recent body thefts, Gray reluctantly
            had to murder (off-screen) a pretty, young blind street singer -
            a stunning murder scene. After Joseph threatened Gray with blackmail to reveal the body snatching
            scheme: (&quot;Give me money or I tell the police that you murder
            the subjects&quot;), Gray smothered Joseph to death, and then
            delivered his corpse to MacFarlane for his use. It was then revealed
            that Gray had been grave-robbing during the Burke and Hare trial,
            and had shielded  the real perpetrator - MacFarlane. Gray had been
            sent to prison after saving MacFarlane. Another
            murder then occurred (witnessed by Gray's cat as shadows on a wall)
            - MacFarlane beat Gray to death for pressuring and tormenting him.
            In the film's classic final sequence during a fierce thunderstorm,
            MacFarlane drove Gray's horse-drawn carriage with a freshly-unearthed
            stolen elderly female corpse in the back. As he proceeded along to
            return to Edinburgh, MacFarlane insanely began to believe that the
            body (with the voice of the murdered Gray) was repetitiously taunting
            him, with his threat made earlier: &quot;(You'll)
            never get rid of me!&quot; and actually was sitting next to him in the driver's seat. As the spooked
            horses raced away, the coach broke loose and plunged out of control
            over the side of a cliff - taking MacFarlane to his death. The
            horror film ended with a closing title card: &quot;It is through
            error that man tries and rises. It is through tragedy he learns.
            All the roads of learning begin in darkness and go out into the
            light.&quot; Hippocrates of Cos</font></p>          </td>

                Les Enfants Du Paradis)</strong>, 190 minutes, D: Marcel Carne<br />
                Marcel Carne's dazzling and beautiful theatrical masterpiece,
                a period costume drama, was set in early 19th century Paris in
                the year 1828. It featured a script by poet and surrealist Jacques
                Pr&eacute;vert. The
                epic romantic classic was shot during the period of France's
                occupation by the Nazis - filmed in secret over an 18-month period.
                At around $1.5 million, it was the most expensive French film
                ever made. Its length of over 3 hours, with a tale that spanned
                several years, required that it be divided into two parts (with
                two separate sets of credits): <i>Boulevard of Crime</i> and <i>The
                Man in White</i>. It has often been dubbed &quot;the
                 French <i>Gone With the Wind</i>.&quot; The epic story was filled with heartbreaking
             tragedy, jealous passions and even murder. It told about a beautiful
            and charismatic courtesan, a raven-haired, fickle, seraphim-like
            (or Garbo-like luminescence) carnival show performer named Garance
            (Arletty), aka Claire Reine. She was courted and loved by four very
            different men during the course of the film: (1) introverted, idealistic,
            delicate, moon-faced theater mime Baptiste Deburau (Jean-Louis Barrault),
            (2) pretentious actor and lothario Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick
            Lema&icirc;tre (Pierre Brasseur),  (3) petty thief Pierre-Fran&ccedil;ois
            Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand), and (4) aristocrat nobleman Count &Eacute;douard
            de Montray (Louis Salou). After the opening
            credits, an actual theatre curtain rose to reveal
              the first view of the 'children of paradise' (the film's title)
            - the poor and rowdy playgoers in the audience who must watch from
            the galleries or balconies at a distance - in the cheap seats. By
            film's end, criminal Lacenaire  assassinated Garance's wealthy and
            protective Count, while Garance found love  in the arms of Baptiste,
            although he was married to Nathalie (Mar&iacute;a Casares) (and had fathered
            a son with her). </font></p>        </td>

            Edgar G. Ulmer's gritty, cheaply-made (&quot;Poverty Row&quot;),
            fatalistic crime film  noir was about the bleak
            twists of fate. The cultish film was made in only 6 days (some say
            15), and was largely ignored when first released. The post-war film
            was remade as <i>Detour
            (1992)</i> and starred the son of the original ill-fated protagonist,
            Tom Neal, Jr. The flashbacked story was cynically narrated almost
            non-stop by world-weary Al Roberts (Tom Neal),
            an East Coast musician. He had been haplessly involved in an ambiguous
            death in Arizona during his thumbing trek from NY to Los Angeles/Hollywood
            after ex-bookie turned businessman Charles Haskell (Edmund MacDonald)
            picked him up in a convertible. When Haskell suffered an apparent
            heart attack and fell out of the passenger side of the car (and his
            head struck a rock), Roberts dumped Haskell's body by the side of
            the road, stole his car and adopted his identity (his ID and his
            clothes). Then, after picking up a vulturous, nasty and despicable,
            yet sexy hitchhiker Vera (Ann Savage), she accused him of not being
            Haskell (&quot;You're
            a cheap crook and you killed him&quot;). She
          turned out to be a blackmailing, vindictive <i>femme fatale</i> con.
          Roberts commented upon fate and the blackmailing, castrating, exploitative,
          sadomasochistic and vindictive femme fatale con: &quot;That's life
          - which ever way you turn, Fate sticks out a foot to trip you up.&quot; Vera
          schemed to turn Roberts in as a murderer, unless he agreed to sell
          the car (and pay her off) and also to claim a substantial inheritance
          from Haskell's dying father, by having them pretend to be Mr. and Mrs.
          Haskell. Things turned against him even further when the drunken Vera
          was accidentally strangled by the doomed protagonist with a telephone
              cord, behind a closed door in their rented Hollywood apartment
          after a vicious argument. Another disastrous
          twist of fate for him was signified by the in-and-out of focus shots
          from his deranged mental state and POV in the bedroom. He imagined
          he would be arrested by the Highway Patrol after leaving a tawdry Reno,
          Nevada diner (to appease the Hays Code censors of the time). The great
          film ended with the quote by self-pitying Roberts who knew his fate
          was sealed as a guilty man: &quot;But
          one thing I don't have to wonder about. I know. Someday a car will
          stop to pick me up that I never thumbed. Yes, fate or some mysterious
          force can put the finger on you or me for no good reason at all.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

        and Emeric Pressburger</font><br />
        <font size="2">A small, unpredictable, precious and unassuming gem of
        a movie from the famed British writer/director/producer team of Powell
        and Pressburger (known as &quot;The Archers&quot;). The wartime, fable-like,
        mystical romance also had some comedy and suspense, accompanied by other-worldly,
        fanciful elements of romantic myth and legend, Scottish dance,
        simple virtues and proud traditions, the ancient curse of castle Sorne,
        and thematic symbols (a dangerous Corryvreckan whirlpool, falcon hawks,
        and isolated islands). With lyrical and haunting cinematography by Erwin
        Hillier. Determined to marry for money as a 'fortune hunter,' ambitious, materialistic, self-centered,
        strong-willed, middle-class 25 year-old Londoner Joan Webster (Wendy
        Hiller) set off from Manchester, England by train to the western isles
        of Scotland. She had decided to engage in a loveless marriage to her
        elderly and stuffy employer - wealthy middle-aged chemical industrialist
        Sir Robert Bellinger (voice of Norman Shelley), the executive owner of
        Consolidated Chemical Industries. He was living on mythical Kiloran island,
        in the Hebrides Islands of Scotland. Nasty weather (fog and violent storms)
        marooned her for a week in a seacoast town on the island of Mull, where
        she met another stranded individual - modest young naval officer Lt.
        Torquil McNeil (Roger Livesey) who was on an 8-day leave. Both stayed
         in the home of a hunting dog lover - dark-eyed Catriona Potts (Pamela
        Brown), along with eccentric falconer Col. Barnstaple (C. W. R. Knight),
        who owned and trained a golden eagle named after Torquil. Joan learned
        that Torquil was the actual owner of Kiloran (and had leased the island
        retreat to Bellinger). She slowly developed a love for Torquil, amidst
        the magical allure of the Scottish highlands, after he helped save her
        from a whirlpool during a risky boat trip with a conked-out engine. Joan's
        values were astutely contrasted with those of another young couple, Kenny
        (Murdo Morrison) and Bridie (Margot Fitzsimons) - after which she learned
        the simple lesson that she should trust her heart rather than her head.</font></p>        </td>

                  minutes, D: Sergei M. Eisenstein<br />
              The first film in the trilogy (never completed fully) was released
              in the mid-1940s and hailed as a success. Followed by Part II (completed
              by 1946) which was suppressed and delayed until 1958 due to a ban
              by Stalin. Part II was titled: <i> Ivan
              Groznyy. Skaz vtoroy: Boyarskiy zagovor (1958). </i>This was the
              last film directed and completed by writer/director Sergei M. Eisenstein,
              and his technique of radical montage was substituted by costume-rich,
              operatic pageantry. An historical film about the idealistic and
              stern 16th century Ivan Vasilyevich (Nikolai Cherkasov), or Ivan
              IV, Duke of Moscow who ruled Russia from 1533 to 1547 as the anointed
              Tsar. His nickname Groznyy was usually translated as Terrible.
              The epic, stagey film (harkening back to highly-stylized silent
              film techniques) was characterized by expressionistic sets, facial
              closeups, heavy costuming, angled camera shots for contrast, stark
              light and shadows, huge sets, religious imagery and a score by
              Prokofiev. The film commenced with the coronation of young Grand
              Prince of Muscovy Ivan, by the approval of a land-owning nobility/bourgeoisie
              class (affluent and hereditary) known as the Boyars. He married
              Anastasia Romanovna (Lyudmila Tselikovskaya), the Czarina, and
              they had a child, infant son Dmitri. The film included his campaign
              against the Tartars in Kazan, Ivan's serious illness on his deathbed,
              battles and campaigns to reclaim lost Russian territory, and his
              self-imposed exile at the Alexandrov monastery before a populist
              movement demanded his return. The entire film was mostly about
              court intrigue and his struggle against the plotting of the Boyars
              and his efforts to make them submit to his powerful will as Tsar.
              He experienced major conflict with his own witchy and scheming
              boyarina Aunt Efrosinia Staritskaya (Serafima Birman) who plotted
              to assassinate him with the help of other traditionalists. She
              wanted to appoint her own dim-witted simpleton son Vladimir Andreyevich Staritsky (Pavel
              Kadochnikov) as the new Tsar. She also encouraged one of Ivan's
              friends, Prince Andrei Kurbsky (Mikhail Nazvanov), who lusted after
              Anastasia, to betray him. Another friend Fyodor Kolychev (Andrei
              Abrikosov) became Archbishop Philip and then became part of a religious
              group that opposed Ivan along with the Boyars. Ultimately, she
              murdered Ivan's wife by having her drink from a poisoned cup of
              wine. Ivan eventually consolidated power in himself through personal
              guards, secret police or &quot;iron men&quot; known as <i>Oprichniki</i>.</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: John M. Stahl<br />
              Based on the best-selling novel by Ben Ames Williams, this unsettling
              psychological noir thriller <i>and</i> lush Technicolored melodrama from director John M. Stahl
              highlighted a menacing, father-fixated, unstable, and deranged,
              darkly alluring <i>femme fatale</i> named Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney). The 'wicked'
              woman was neurotically-possessive and psycho-insanely-jealous.
              Vincent Price portrayed her vengeful, jilted fiancee/ex-lover 
              Russell Quinton, a newly-elected Boston-area district attorney.
              After proposing marriage, Ellen vowed to her deceived novelist
              husband Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde), who resembled her father,
              that she wanted him all to herself: &quot;I'll
              never let you go, never, never,&quot; stopping at nothing to make
        the man she loved her exclusive possession. The most dramatic scene was the
        drowning murder of her paraplegic brother-in-law Danny (Darryl Hickman)
        in a Maine lake as she calmly watched from a nearby rowboat. When he
        became exhausted and distressed in the water from severe stomach cramps
        (after eating a large lunch), Ellen passively watched as he called out: &quot;Help
        me!&quot; He submerged twice and then disappeared under the surface.
        She pretended to assist him by diving in, but it was obviously too late.
        Later, Ellen deliberately fell down a flight of stairs to cause a miscarriage
        and kill her unborn child. And finally, she committed suicide
        with poison, implicating her adoptive sister Ruth Berent (Jeanne
        Crain) in the death (although Ruth was found innocent) and sending Richard
        to jail for two years for withholding evidence as an accessory to murder </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Billy Wilder<br />
             Director Billy Wilder's ground-breaking, Best Picture-winning film was based
              on Charles Jackson's 1944 novel by co-screenwriters Charles Brackett
              and Wilder himself, and was filmed in NYC. <i>The Lost Weekend</i> was
              a classic, melodramatic, realistically-grim and uncompromising
			   &quot;social-problem&quot; film of the 1940s, about the controversial subject of alcoholism, told
              partially in flashback. Rather than join his brother Wick Birnam
              (Phillip Terry) on a weekend outing to the country, talented New
              York aspiring novel writer Don Birnam (Oscar-winning Ray Milland)
              - a chronic alcoholic with writer's block - spent a 'lost weekend'
              on a wild, self-destructive drinking binge. Eluding his persistently
              supportive girlfriend Helen St. James (Jane Wyman), he desperately
              trudged down Third Avenue on Yom Kippur attempting to find an open
              pawnshop to hock his own typewriter for another drink. In Bellevue
              Hospital's alcohol detoxification ward (shot on location) after
              a debilitating alcoholic binge, he awakened to shrieking inmates
              suffering the DTs, and suffered torment from sadistic male nurse
              'Bim' Nolan (Frank Faylen). In his apartment, Birnam experienced
              hallucinations of a mouse attacked by a bat. He narrowly avoided
              committing suicide by shooting himself in the 'optimistic' ending.
              He vowed to write about his 'lost weekend' in a novel titled <i>The
              Bottle</i>. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Michael Curtiz<br />
            Director Michael Curtiz' glossy soap opera
            tale, adapted from James M. Cain's 1941 hard-boiled novel, was one
            of the best melodramatic, 'women's pictures' (or &quot;weepies&quot;)
            and film noir classics of the 1940s - and also was Joan Crawford's
            comeback film after a two-year absence. The intense
            and obsessive mother-love story began with the startling murder of
			 two-timing husband Monte Beragon (Zachary Scott)
            in a beach house - by an unknown, unidentified and unseen assailant.
            He was shot to death as he uttered the film's first word: &quot;Mildred!&quot; In
            the next scene, the prime suspect - fur-coated Mildred
            Pierce (Oscar-winning Joan Crawford) was
              walking on a Santa Monica, CA pier where she was saved from suicide
              by a patrolling cop: (&quot;You take a swim, I'd have to take a
              swim. Is that fair? Just because you feel like bumpin' yourself
              off, I gotta get pneumonia? Never thought about that, did ya? OK.
              Think about it. Go on, beat it now. Go on home before we both take
              a swim&quot;). She was being thoroughly interrogated by police
            for the killing of her second husband - cad playboy Monte. The plot
              unfolded with three  flashback sequences (and effective
              voice-over narration) from the local police station where Mildred
              was brought for questioning, and where she initially took the blame
              for Monte's murder. Housewife Mildred had been divorced from her
              decent first husband Bert Pierce (Bruce Bennett). The hardworking,
              dowdy divorced mother obsessively doted on her two daughters, especially
              rotten, ungrateful, spoiled and selfish elder 16 year-old daughter
              Veda (Ann Blyth). To support herself and Veda, Mildred waited tables
              in a downtown restaurant in addition to baking pies at home. Veda
              was harshly critical: &quot;My mother, a waitress!&quot; Through
               determination and will-power, Mildred then opened up a small restaurant
               with the help of her wisecracking friend Ida (Eve Arden) and long-time
              rejected suitor Wally Fay (Jack Carson). She developed it into
              a successful and profitable chain, received legal assistance
              from realtor/rebuffed beau and businessman Wally Fay, and
              went into a partnership with socially-prominent but scuzzy, opportunistic
              lounge lizard and playboy Monte Beragon.  She also began to develop
              a romantic relationship with Monte. Meanwhile, Bert assented
            to an official divorce while also expressing jealous rage toward
              Mildred's association with Monte. Eventually, Monte and
            Veda spent her money and exploitatively sent her into bankruptcy.
              Mildred also delivered an ultimatum warning to Monte to stay away
              from her pretentious daughter Veda for good: (&quot;Stay
            away from Veda...And it isn't funny. She's only seventeen years
            old and spoiled rotten&quot;). Mildred's concern was that she
            would  lose her self-indulgent daughter
            to him. She determined her best course of action was to   personally
            dump the ungrateful Monte - and fire him. The
            petulant, selfishly-ungrateful Veda became estranged from Mildred
            after she had greedily helped to contribute to the restaurant's financial
            ruin. They had a vicious smack-down in her home, when Veda slapped
            Mildred across the face and knocked her down onto the stairs. Mildred
            rose and stood face to face in front of Veda and commanded her cold-hearted
            daughter: (&quot;Get out, Veda&quot;). After a while, the   now-affluent
            Mildred negotiated with cash-poor Monte to purchase his &quot;antiquated,&quot; 
          run-down Beragon mansion, and she also proposed a marriage of convenience.
           Beragon accepted if she would offer him a one-third share of Mildred's
          successful business. Mildred married Monte Beragon - a heartless and
          loveless marriage - for his social status and family name, and to provide
          the kind of social background that Veda craved. Mildred was unaware
          that Veda was romancing  her own step-father
            (a semi-incestuous relationship) behind the restaurateur's long-suffering
          back. Mildred was also stunned to learn that she was facing bankruptcy
          when Monte wished to sell out his one-third interest in Mildred's business;
          she took a gun and placed it in her pocket before driving to the beach
          house at around midnight. A final confrontation
            (seen in the third concluding flashback) revealed a resolution to
          the murder mystery. At the beach house, Mildred caught her promiscuous
          daughter in the midst of an affair with Monte. Veda 
           boldly stated to Mildred: &quot;Monte's going
            to divorce you and marry me, and there's nothing you can do about
            it&quot;; however, once Mildred left (after discarding her gun on
            the floor), Monte rebuffed and rejected Veda: (&quot;Just
            where did you get the idea I'm going to marry you?... I'm not
            joking. If you think I'm going to marry you, you're very much
            mistaken.... Look. You don't really think I could be in love with
            a rotten little tramp like you, do you?&quot;) - Veda pulled Mildred's
            gun on Monte and shot him to death. Outside in her car, Mildred
            heard six shots - and when she came back inside, she found her
            crazed, impassioned daughter standing over the dead body of Monte.
            Veda desperately begged for her mother not to report Monte's murder
            to police, but Mildred didn't give in. Back in the present after
            the final flashback, Veda had incriminated herself and was booked
            for murder and led away. Outside the police office, Mildred was reconciled
            with her estranged ex-husband Bert in the early morning dawn.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), </b>110 minutes,
              D: Albert Lewin<br />
Writer-director Albert Lewin's black and white occult-horror fantasy drama
was based upon Oscar Wilde's 1891 story about a man's soul and its evil destiny.
It told about the fate of healthy, handsome, and young 19th century Victorian
Englishman Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield), a vain aristocrat who had his portrait
painted by his friend Basil Hallward (Lowell Gilmore). Gray was distressed when
reminded by cynical, dissolute and witty old acquaintance Lord Henry Wotton (George
Sanders) that he would not be handsome and youthful forever. The finished painting
would remind Gray that he would not remain perpetually youthful forever. He jealously
spoke to the painting in the presence of a statue of the ancient Egyptian goddess
Bast, that he would &quot;sell
my very soul&quot; if he could stay young-looking forever and never grow old, while the figure in the
painting would take on all of the decaying and corruptive qualities that came
with aging. The wish appeared to come true, as the painting aged (locked away
in an attic room), while Gray remained youthful. In addition to remaining good-looking,
he had become hedonistic, narcissistic, ruthless, heartless, and mean in his
heart, and the painting reflected his evil soul. He fell in love with singer
Sibyl Vane (Angela Lansbury) whom he met at the Two Turtles Pub, but then rejected
her as his fiancee with a hurtful and demeaning letter, causing her to commit
suicide by poison. Years later when Dorian was 40 (although he still looked like
he was 22), painter Basil demanded to see the painting locked away in Dorian's
attic - the portrait was again revealed in full color. When 
          Basil attempted to warn Dorian and pleaded with him to reform his
          life after seeing the changed portrait corrupted by secret sins,
          Dorian went into a panic and murdered Basil by stabbing him to death
          in the back, and then hid his body in the room with the painting. Dorian
          became acquainted with Basil's niece Gladys Hallward (Donna Reed),
          and soon seized her away from her noble suitor David Stone (Peter Lawford);
          however, a stealthy Stone divulged that he had entered Dorian's locked
          attic room and had seen the horrid painting created by Gladys' uncle
          Basil. During the revelation of the evil of Dorian's portrait, Gladys
          received a rejection letter from Dorian himself - at age 38, he claimed
          it would be wicked to marry her and he would spare her, although she
          wanted to marry him. In the concluding shocking scene, Dorian viewed
            his own painting - curious to see what the effects of his behavior
            had been upon it. There was a sudden and shocking
            final view of the hideously-aged painted portrait of Gray (occasionally
            shown in Technicolor) showing the ravages of sin and withered aging
            (while he remained young, vain and handsome). Dorian  attempted
            to stab the heart of his image in the picture (with the knife used
            to stab and kill Basil) to release his awful visage and the spell
            that had been cast upon him, but he actually stabbed his own heart;
            he collapsed to the floor. As he died,
            he miraculously took on the hideous and deformed characteristics
            of the painting - while the painting reverted back to its original
            depiction of Dorian as a young man (as a swinging lamp cast ominous
          shadows).</font></p>        </td>

                  Citt&agrave; Aperta)</strong>, 100 minutes, D: Roberto Rossellini<br />
                  This war film was set at the time of Anti-Nazi Resistance in
                  Rome during German occupation of Italy in WWII, and was often
                  mistaken for documentary footage. Roberto Rossellini's influential,
                  low-budget documentary-like landmark film formally introduced
                  Italian Neo-realism - it was the first film in a Rossellini
                  'war trilogy' of post-war Neo-realistic films. The gritty and
                  realistic post-war film used on-location cinematography, grainy
                  low-grade black-and-white film stock (due to war-time), and
                  untrained actors in improvised scenes. The film followed the
                  plight of fugitive Resistance leader Giorgio Manfredi (Marcello
                  Pagliero), who was eventually caught and tortured to death,
                  after being betrayed by traitorous ex-girlfriend and prostitute
                  Marina Mari (Maria Michi). In another of the shocking, realistic scenes, pregnant widow Pina
                  (Anna Magnani) ran after a military truck hysterically screaming
                  the name of her lithographer fiancee and underground leader
                  Francesco (Francesco Grandjacquet), who was just arrested.
                  She broke away from a soldier molesting her and ran after Francesco,
                  when she was abruptly machine-gunned and killed the morning
                  of her planned wedding day. Witnessing the murder was Pina's
                  ten year-old son Marcello (Vito Annichiarico) and brave Catholic
                  parish priest Don Pietro Pellegrini (Aldo Fabrizi), both involved
                  in the Resistance movement. In the film's conclusion, the priest

          <p><font size="2"><b>Scarlet Street (1945),</b> 103 minutes, D: Fritz
              Lang<br />
              This was an early classic non-detective film noir from director
              Fritz Lang, a steamy and fatalistic tale - and one of the
              moodiest, steamiest, blackest thrillers ever made. It was the tragic,
              nightmarish and cynical story of a meek, middle-aged, mild-mannered
              clerk-cashier and unhappily-married, hen-pecked husband Christopher
              Cross (Edward G. Robinson), a painter, who was hungering for affection.
              The film opened with a dinner honoring him for 25 years of service.
              Afterwards, he unwittingly fell into a cruel trap and web of intrigue
              set by cold-hearted, amoral <i>femme fatale</i> gold-digger Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; March
              (Joan Bennett), and her abusive, slick and mercenary lover-boyfriend-pimp
              Johnny (Dan Duryea). Cross first met Kitty when she was being beaten
              up by Johnny on a rainy night (a set-up), and they got to know
              each other in a bar for a late-night drink. He was immediately
              entranced by the clear plastic raincoat-wearing sexy dame. The
             evil and deceitful female led Cross to commit embezzlement (of his wife's
              and employer's funds) in order to rent an expensive apartment for
              her (to serve as an art studio); she also impersonated him in order
              to sell his surrealistic paintings (along with Johnny), and was
            deceitful and cruel to Cross. Kitty took the credit for the paintings
              (with Cross' approval, since he felt he was symbolically linked
              to her) and became a celebrity. In the middle of all the deceptive
              proceedings, there was an amazing and contrived plot-twist; the
              previous husband of Cross' wife Adele (Rosalind Ivan), corrupt
              policeman Patch-eye Homer Higgins (Charles Kemper) suddenly resurfaced
              - he had been presumed drowned. Cross now assumed
          that his marriage to Adele was invalidated, and that he was free
          to marry Kitty. He was suspicious that &quot;Kitty&quot; and Johnny
          were romantically-involved, but still believed he had a chance to marry
          her. His pitiful and pathetic proposal
          of marriage to Kitty was flatly refused. She responded
            by humiliating him and revealing  
          her true feelings for him - she called Cross an &quot;idiot&quot;: &quot;Oh,
          you idiot! How can a man be so dumb?...I've wanted to go laugh in your
          face ever since I first met you. You're old and ugly and I'm sick of
          you. Sick, sick, sick!&quot; After  she ordered him out (&quot;You
          want to marry me? You? Get out of here! Get out! Get away from me!&quot;)
          -- he lost control of his feelings, leading him to commit murder in
          a jealous rage by stabbing her with an ice-pick through her bed covers
          when she hid. The film ended with Johnny being
          falsely accused of the crime and executed (in the electric chair),
          while Cross was only fired from his job for embezzling funds from his
          employer. He was not considered a suspect due to his secretive relationship
          with Kitty. However, Cross was a broken man - he suffered
          humiliating disgrace, haunting psychological torment and mental anguish
          (i.e., Cross attempted suicide by hanging and failed, and in abject
          homelessness as a bum, he wandered the streets). The final image was
          his shuffling by a 5th Avenue gallery passing the 'self-portrait' he
          had drawn of Kitty, and overhearing its sale to an elderly matron for
          $10,000. The last lines of dialogue were heard as the haunted Cross
          slowly ambled down the deserted street under a movie marquee - he thought
          of Kitty and Johnny together, with echoing words of love spoken (off-screen)
            between them: Kitty: &quot;Johnny. Oh Johnny.&quot; Johnny: &quot;Lazy
          Legs.&quot; Kitty: &quot;Jeepers, I love you, Johnny.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Seventh Veil (1945, UK),</b> 95 minutes, D:
              Compton Bennett<br />
              The tagline for this well-produced and acted romantic and psychological
              melodrama described: &quot;Is There Always a SEVENTH VEIL Between a
              Woman and the Men Who Love Her?&quot; The Muriel and Sydney Box story
              won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. It was the compelling
              story of teenaged Francesca Cunningham (Ann Todd), a world-famed concert pianist
              who had left her family. The film opened with her escape from a
              mental hospital, and her attempt to commit suicide with a night-time
              jump off a bridge. For rehabilitation and psychological treatment,
              she met with psychiatrist Dr. Larsen (Herbert Lom), who used hypnosis therapy to have the neurotic
              Francesca talk about her past, and the events and people that led
              her to a deep depression and mute state, and her inability to play
              the piano. The film, through flashback, peeled back the layers
              of Francesca's mentally-ill and unstable mind, composed of various
              veils. The removal of the last seventh veil would reveal her subconscious.
              She explained how as a 14 year-old orphan, she lived with her controlling
              and stern guardian (her second cousin), a crippled bachelor named
              Nicholas (James Mason), who forced her to practice piano five to
              six hours a day, helping her to become an excellent classical pianist.
              The Svengali-like Nicholas kept Francesca from other love interests,
               including her first musically-talented beau, American band leader
               Peter Gay (Hugh McDermott). After being forbidden to marry Peter,
               Francesca moved in with a German bohemian portrait artist-painter
               named Maxwell Leyden (Albert Lieven). Again, Nicholas demanded
               full control over her and thwarted her. He struck her hands with
               his cane while she was playing Beethoven's &quot;Path&eacute;tique&quot;
               Sonata. When she fled with Max, the two had a serious automobile
               accident, and Francesca's hands were also burned. She was hospitalized
               - and the film returned to the present time. Dr. Larsen believed
               rightly that Francesca would be able to resume playing if she
               listened to a recording of Beethoven's Sonata. By the film's illogical
               and semi-twisted conclusion, the cured Francesca chose to remain
               with the demanding, dominant, and enigmatic Nicholas, the possessive
               mentor who had helped to nurture her to succeed in her career. </font></p>        </td>

        Renoir<br />
        French director Renoir's drama was based on George Sessions Perry's 1941
        novel, 
		&quot;Hold Autumn in Your Hand.&quot;  His third US feature film, it became
		one of the best of the five films French director Renoir made in the
		US from 1941 to 1947 after he had migrated to Hollywood (due to the advent
		of WWII). Some called it &quot;the first
        successful essay in Franco-American screen collaboration.&quot; When
        released, however, it was met with a poor box-office response, and in
        the South by boycotts and pickets from Southerners who disliked the depiction
        of their way of life. However, it was a critical success (Renoir was
        nominated for a Best Director Academy Award), and in 1946 it won the
        Venice Film Festival award for Best Feature Film. The visually-poetic
        drama, with quasi-documentary elements and sparse dialogue, told an inspiring
        and moving story about a poor southern tenant farmer's struggle to raise
        his own crops and support his family in the Deep South of southern Texas.
        Uneducated cotton picker field-hand Sam Tucker (Zachary Scott) decided
        to own and farm his own land (but without modern farm equipment) - as
        a sharecropper, by renting some unpromising, abandoned river-front property
        with meager soil that had been unfarmed from his boss/employer Ruston
        (Paul Harvey). Sam and his family moved into a miserable rundown shack
        with a dry well. His family consisted of his tough, loyal and supportive
        wife Nona (Betty Field), his two adolescent children Jot (Jay Gilpin)
        and Daisy (Jean Vanderwilt), his cranky and stubborn paternal Granny
        (Beulah Bondi) - and then Sam's mother Mama Tucker (Blanche Yurka). Although
        determined to succeed, they faced numerous trials in an endless succession
        of natural and man-made problems - nutritional ignorance, illness and
        disease (son Jot suffered from pellagra or &quot;spring
        sickness&quot;), the jealous Devers (J. Carrol Naish) - a bitter and
        mean neighbor and his hired hand nephew Finlay (Norman Lloyd), torrential
        downpours, etc. Although appearing defeated, the family continued to
        persevere, and the humanistic film closed on a note of optimism. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Spellbound (1945), </b>111 minutes, D: Alfred
              Hitchcock<br />
        Director Alfred Hitchcock's film noirish psychological mystery-thriller
        often used Freudian symbols and analysis to add richness to the mysterious
        plot about identity confusion, adapted by Ben Hecht and Angus MacPhail
        from the novel <i>The House of Dr. Edwardes</i>. In the story, intellectual,
        frigid and cool-minded psychiatrist Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman)
        was having a love affair with the handsome new director of the Green
        Manors mental hospital (or asylum), Dr. Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck).
        He had been selected to take over the asylum's head position and replace
        the outgoing director Dr. Murchison (Leo G. Carroll). As their love deepened,
        she began to rationally suspect that Dr. Edwardes was delusional and
        homicidal, and had possibly murdered the real Dr. Edwardes (Edward Fielding).
        But at the same time, she was concerned that he might also be innocently
        delusional and was suffering from anxiety attacks, neurosis, paranoia,
        and mostly from amnesia. The Edwardes-imposter eventually remembered
        his real name - John Ballantyne (or &quot;JB&quot;). Hitchcock featured
        set-pieces to depict the crazed mental state of 'Edwardes' -  there were
        disturbing recurring lines on a white background, including the image
        of parallel fork lines on a tablecloth, patterns on a robe and on a bedspread,
        and sled tracks on white snow, for example. These patterns were JB's
        partial recollection (and partial repression) of his witnessing of the
        murder of the real Dr. Edwardes, his analyst, on a ski slope at Gabriel
        Valley. A pivotal, brilliant nightmarish dream-remembrance sequence,
        conceived by surrealist artist Salvador Dali, occurred during JB's visit
        to Constance's old teacher and psychologist Dr. Alexander Brulov (Michael
        Chekhov) to diagnose JB's case. Due to Ballantyne's trauma, he had dreamt
        of eyes painted on curtains in a gambling room, a blackjack (21) card
        game initially with blank cards, an angry proprietor, a sloping roof,
        a misshapen wheel, and a pair of pursuing wings. As Dr. Petersen and
        JB attempted to retrace his steps by returning to the ski slope to analyze
         the dream symbols, during a blood-chilling sequence, the guilt-ridden
        Ballantyne - during a ski run with Constance on the slopes toward the
        same precipice where Edwardes had skiied off to his death - vividly remembered
        a traumatic childhood incident. He recalled his young brother's accidental
        and tragic death by impalement on a spiked fence. JB had inadvertently
        killed his brother by sliding down an incline and pushing the boy off
        the roof onto the protruding spikes. By film's end, it was revealed that
        the murderer of Dr. Edwardes was not Ballantyne but the jealous and treacherous
        Dr. Murchison, who had framed imposter-Ballantyne for the murder of Edwardes.
        Motivated by jealousy and by not wanting his job to be taken by Dr. Edwardes,
        Murchison had used Ballantyne's disabilities to frame him. During Murchison's
        analysis of Ballantyne's dream with  Dr. Petersen, she tricked him  into
        admitting that he
              had followed Edwardes and JB to the ski slope and shot
               Edwardes from behind as he skiied toward the cliff's edge.
              Fifty feet behind when the tragedy occurred, JB had then subconsciously
              assumed the guilt of the murder and substituted himself for Edwardes
              at the sanitarium. Murchison aimed his gun at Dr. Petersen's back
              after she revealed his treachery. [Note: He had given himself away
              when he told her: &quot;I
            knew Edwardes only slightly. I never really liked him. But he was
            a good man, in a way, I suppose.&quot; If Murchison had known Edwardes,
            he shouldn't have mistaken Ballantyne for Edwardes.] Then, after
            she calmly left to phone the police, Murchison slowly turned toward
            the camera and fired suicidally at himself - there was a burst of
            a red colored gunflash (in the black and white film). </font></p>        </td>

          D: John Ford<br />
           Toward the close of the war, director Ford (after making wartime documentaries) based
          this realistic, old-fashioned, under-rated, inspiring and bleak (black
          and white) war film upon the historically-true story of the Navy's
          PT boat squadrons and crews based in the Philippines that were supporting
          the naval war in the Pacific campaign. The crews of the fast, maneuverable,
          lightweight plywood (not metal) PT (short for patrol torpedo) boats
          armed with torpedos, were there during the early years of the war (Dec
          1941 - April 1942) and faced the greatly-outnumbered advance of Japanese
          forces immediately after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The straight-forward,
          well-directed, semi-patriotic film, a detailed and authentic-looking
          action-war drama, was based on William L. White's bestselling 1942
          book with the same title about torpedo boat squadron commander Lt.
          John Brickley (real-life Congressional Medal of Honor winner John Bulkeley)
          (Robert Montgomery) and his second-in-command executive officer, PT
          boat officer/skipper Lt. J.G. &quot;Rusty&quot; Ryan  (real-life
          Robert Kelly) (John Wayne). A hospitalized Ryan had moments of on-screen
          romance with nurse Lt. Sandy Davyss (Donna Reed) when he was in sick

              D: Elia Kazan<br />
              This sincere, endearing and moving family drama and coming-of-age
              tale marked Elia Kazan's directorial debut. It was based on Betty
              Smith's beloved 1943 novel with the same name, about a turn-of-the-century
              Brooklyn family of Irish members, the Nolans, who were struggling
              to survive in their challenging tenement neighborhood-environment.
              In one scene set at their apartment window, improvident Irish singing
              waiter Johnny Nolan (Oscar-winning James Dunn) told his bright
              young 13 year-old daughter Francie Nolan (Special Oscar-winning
              Peggy Ann Garner), an aspiring writer, that she needn't worry that
              the neighbors killed a courtyard tree nearby, with an optimistic
              tone: &quot;They didn't kill it, why they could cut that old tree right down to
              the ground and a root would push up someplace else in the cement.
              You wait until springtime, my darlin', you'll see.&quot; He was encouraging,
              comparing their family's (and his own) struggles to the resilient
              tree in their tenement area. The down-to-earth, frugal, strong-willed,
              hard-working and firm mother Katie Nolan (Dorothy McGuire) was
              the backbone and strength of the family, and was appropriately
              hard on Johnny, although her treatment of him was misunderstood
              by Francie. Johnny was a ne'er-do-well loser, due to his frequent
              drinking and irresponsible nature, but he was still kind, loving
              and encouraging. He sat with dreamer Francie at her bedside at
              Christmastime, and encouraged her aspirations to grow up and be
              a writer. In a heartbreaking scene, he watched her fall asleep,
              faced the truth and decided to go out and find a real job (to support
              his now-pregnant wife, and to keep Francie in school) - and never
              came home again. He died from pneumonia - exposure to the elements
              while job-searching. </font></p>        </td>

              Lewis Milestone<br />
              Director Lewis Milestone's modest yet starkly realistic, dialogue-filled,
              unglamorized combat film was based upon the novel by <i>Yank Magazine's</i> Harry
              Brown. This was Milestone's second (and middle) film in a war trilogy, 
			  composed of <i><a href="allq.html">All Quiet on the
              Western Front (1930)</a></i>, and <i>Pork Chop Hill (1959)</i>. It is often considered one of the
              best WWII war-battle films ever made, although it was essentially bloodless.
              It thoughtfully portrayed the psychological stress felt by the
              US GIs. It intimately followed an American infantry unit in 1943,
              led by platoon squad leader Sgt. Bill Tyne (Dana Andrews), that
              was struggling to survive during a combat mission. They were making
              a frontal assault on a fortified, Nazi-occupied farmhouse in Italy,
              as part of the Allied attack on Anzio. The tension and fear was
              brilliantly captured on the faces of the terrified soldiers as
              they took the short, six-mile journey (from the coastal beach at
              Salerno, moving inland through the Italian countryside) to the
