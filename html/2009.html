                  Cameron<br />
                  Director James Cameron's revolutionary and major blockbuster
                  film was the highest grossing (domestic) film of 2010 - and
                  of the entire 2001-2010 decade. The lengthy and impressive
                  futuristic sci-fi epic about a fictional universe, with superb
                  visual effects, was set in the 22nd century (specifically in
                  the year 2154), at a time when the dystopian Earth was threatened
                  by a major energy crisis. Humans were experimenting with colonizing
                  a habitable, Earth-like moon known as Pandora, a lush and
                  densely rain-forested area inhabited by an indigenous tribal
                  species (similar to Native-Americans) of blue-skinned Na'vi
                  - 10 foot tall humanoids with blue skin. The creatures were
                  harmonious with nature, worshipped a mother-goddess named
                  Eywa, and often gathered at Hometree, a giant tree at the
                  center of their neural network. The moon Pandora was orbiting
                  around a gas-giant planet known as Polyphemus located in the
                  Alpha Centauri A star system. It had been colonized to take
                  advantage of its valuable semi-conductor mineral and energy
                  supply known as unobtanium (located at Hometree) - planned
                  to be mined by the Resources Development Administration (RDA).
                  It was a hostile environment for humans due to its poisonous
                  atmosphere, requiring humans to wear breathing gear. In the
                  film's story, an Avatar program had been created on Earth to
                  explore Pandora more safely by humans. The mega-corporate,
                  military-backed, scientific program was led by Dr. Grace
                  Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her assistant Norm Spellman
                  (Joel David Moore). Paraplegic, wheelchair-bound ex-marine
                  combat vet Jake Scully (Sam Worthington) had been selected
                  to interact with the native Pandoran Na'vi through an 'avatar'
                  - a genetically-grown, half-alien/half-human body (hybrid)
                  of a Na'vi individual jacked into and controlled by his brain.
                  It was evident that incursions into the Na'vi's biosphere habitat
                  by the expanding mining colony were threatening their
                  existence. On his first use of an avatar during a 'virtual'
                  outing to Pandora, Jake was attacked but saved by Neytiri (Zoe
                  Saldana), a female Na'vi and Princess, and then taken to her
                  clan. The brutal and insensitive villain of the film was RDA's
                  security head Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who
                  pressured Jake to spy on the Na'vi and report on their ways.
                  He was aided in a plot to destroy Hometree, take over their
                  homeland, and mine the unobtanium by RDA's head mining
                  administrator Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi). As Jake
                  learned the Na'vi's ways, and developed an emotionally loving
                  relationship with Neytiri, he was torn between his sympathy
                  for his adoptive natives, and his obligations to follow orders
                  from the Earth-bound, corrupt government corporation. </font></p>            </td>

                    (2009)</b>, 122 minutes, D: Werner Herzog<br />
                  The protagonist - a corrupt junkie cop, was this moody and
                  offbeat police crime drama's only similarity to Abel Ferrara's
                  previous film <i>Bad Lieutenant (1992)</i> with Harvey
                  Keitel. In the potboiling plot set in post-Katrina New Orleans
                  in the year 2005, sports gambling-addicted detective Lt.
                  Terence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage) was also sidelined by
                  continuous pain-killer drug use for a chronic back injury. The
                  unhinged, out-of-control depraved cop's romantic life
                  consisted of seeing cocaine-using girlfriend/prostitute
                  Frankie Donnenfeld (Eva Mendes). His personal life was also a
                  complex mess - with an estranged alcoholic father Pat McDonagh
                  (Tom Bower), an alcoholic stepmother Genevieve McDonagh
                  (Jennifer Coolidge), gambling losses and increasing debts to
                  his bookie Ned Schoenholtz (Brad Dourif), theft of police
                  property (drugs) from the Evidence Room, and then Frankie's
                  beating by a well-connected client named Justin (Shea
                  Whigham). He was called to investigate the killing of five
                  Senegalese illegal immigrants in the same family who were
                  retaliated against by powerful neighborhood drug-gang leader
                  Big Fate (Alvin 'Xzibit' Joiner) and his two assistant thugs
                  Midget (Lucius Baston) and G (Tim Bellow), for trading drugs
                  and encroaching on their territory. During McDonagh's
                  investigation, a 15 year-old delivery boy who was an auditory
                  witness to the crime fled to England to avoid testifying.
                  McDonagh resorted to bullying the boy's elderly, hairdresser
                  grandmother Binnie Rogers (Irma P. Hall). To resolve his
                  desperate financial debt troubles and addictions, the frantic
                  rogue cop McDonagh chose to become allied with Big Fate to
                  illegally obtain drugs, and to recover from his debt problems.
                  However, he then cleverly betrayed Big Fate by planting
                  evidence, leading to the drug lord's arrest for the Senegalese
                  murders. There was a chance for the "bad lieutenant's"
                  redemption in the ambiguous conclusion. </font></p>            </td>

                  minutes, D: John Lee Hancock<br />
                  This biographical sports drama, told in flashback, was based
                  on Michael Lewis' 2006 non-fiction book, <i>The Blind Side:
                    Evolution of a Game. </i>The inspiring but sappy film told
                  the true story of the remarkable life and career of
                  African-American Michael "Mike" Oher (Quinton Aaron), who rose
                  from his poor upbringing in a housing project ("Hurt Village")
                  to become an NFL pro player. The young disadvantaged 17
                  year-old teen was from a broken home and living an
                  impoverished, homeless life in a suburb of Memphis, TN. He was
                  fortunate enough to attend the private Wingate Christian
                  school while he was in foster care - due to his mother
                  Denise's (Adriane Lenox) drug-addiction and a deceased father.
                  His large athletic build was promising for a football career,
                  although he had a childlike personality. At school, he became
                  acquainted with precocious younger classmate Sean ("SJ")
                  Tuohy, Jr. (Jae Head) and his teenaged sister Collins Tuohy
                  (Lily Collins). Both were the children of well-to-do Taco Bell
                  fast-food franchise owner Sean J. Tuohy (Tim McGraw) and his
                  wife - strong-willed, outspoken decorator business-woman Leigh
                  Anne (Sandra Bullock). Gradually, Mike was invited into the
                  stable Tuohy suburban household and eventually was fully
                  adopted by the upscale family (with his mother's assent). He
                  struggled as an average student, but was rated high on
                  "protective instincts," and excelled on the football field as
                  a left tackle. His talent opened the door to overtures from
                  many school recruitment coaches to play collegiate football.
                  When Mike decided to attend the University of Mississippi
                  ("Ole Miss") with an athletic scholarship, the alma mater of
                  his adoptive parents, the NCAA's Investigator Granger (Sharon
                  Morris/Conley) questioned if the Tuohys had unduly and
                  unethically influenced him. Momentarily, Mike began to wonder
                  about the Tuohy's motives, especially Leigh Anne's "project"
                  to remake him, and to prepare him to succeed at their own
                  school. However, he soon realized they were his true family,
                  with no other ulterior motives. In the film's epilogue,
                  Michael became the first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens in
                  the 2009 NFL draft as an offensive lineman (left tackle).</font></p>            </td>

                  Thomas Cobb's 1987 novel (inspired by the life of singer Hank
                  Thompson) was the basis for the showbiz drama's screenplay,
                  about a world-weary, fading 57 year-old, down-and-out,
                  embittered country music singer-songwriter named Otis "Bad"
                  Blake (Best Actor-winning Jeff Bridges). His best days were
                  behind him, due to his ongoing serious drinking problem and at
                  least four failed marriages. He was mostly performing on the
                  road (in Texas and the Southwest) in small town dives, local
                  bar spots, and bowling alleys, while staying in local motels
                  and driving his own 1977 Chevrolet Suburban. Blake had become
                  jealous of the success of a popular superstar singer named
                  Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) that he had previously mentored in
                  his back-up band. He began to develop a romantic relationship
                  with young, struggling and divorced music journalist Jean
                  Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal) after she interviewed him for a
                  story in Santa Fe, and he was able to establish a friendship
                  with her 4-year-old son, Buddy (Jack Nation). The
                  self-destructive singer had a wake-up call after a
                  drunk-driving accident, and was informed about his impending
                  mortality if he didn't change his drinking habits, lose
                  weight, and stop chain-smoking. Although he began to
                  rehabilitate himself, his affair with Jean ended and they
                  broke-up. One of his composed songs, "The Weary Kind"
                  (inspired by his love for Jean) became a hit record for Tommy,
                  sustaining Blake with royalty checks. The film ended on the
                  possibility of redemption and salvation for Blake, with
                  new-found hope and continuing encounters with Jean.</font></p>            </td>

                  The 2003 memoirs of British journalist Lynn Barber provided
                  the basis for this coming-of-age period drama written by
                  screenwriter Nick Hornby. Set in 1961, smart and pretty
                  teenaged 16 year-old Jenny Mellor (Carey Mulligan), living in
                  suburban London (Twickenham), had her future all planned out -
                  attendance at Oxford University with a scholarship. Her
                  scholastic objectives were to learn Latin, play the cello, and
                  study hard. Her strict and overbearing father Jack (Alfred
                  Molina) was particularly interested in pushing Jenny to
                  achieve due to her superior intelligence and exceptional
                  talent. After she met urbane and charming Jewish newcomer
                  David Goldman (Peter Sarsgaard), the impressionable teen's
                  life changed when she was seduced into entering a romantic
                  relationship with him, despite tremendous age disparity. She
                  was attracted by his sophistication, free-wheeling spirit and
                  worldliness, and soon (with her studies taking a back-seat)
                  began a series of real-life, fast-track adventures with David
                  and his friend (and crime partner) Danny (Dominic Cooper), and
                  Danny's dumb girlfriend Helen (Rosamund Pike). The stubborn
                  Jenny didn't believe she was making bad choices when she began
                  to experience the day-to-day world with the well-connected
                  con-man - it was much more enticing than her mundane and
                  boring educational pursuits. They visited art auctions, jazz
                  concerts, and fancy restaurants. However, she had suspicions
                  and misgivings when she witnessed evidence of David's
                  unscrupulous behavior - forgery, theft, and a housing scam
                  (known as "blockbusting"), but then dismissed her doubts.
                  After a life-altering 17th birthday trip with the seductive
                  David to Paris, where she lost her virginity, Jenny accepted
                  David's proposal of marriage, and made an impulsive
                  change-of-heart decision to drop out of school and forego her
                  university education. However, she had an epiphany when she
                  uncovered the fact that huckster playboy David was married
                  (with a child). She immediately broke up with him, and after
                  some struggles and delays, she was able to get back on the
                  right path to attend Oxford. In the film's closing voice-over
                  narration, Jenny expressed how she was starting over at school
                  with a fresh perspective and new outlook on dating "boys." </font></p>            </td>

                  154 minutes, D: Niels Arden Oplev<br />
                  This was the original, grim Swedish thriller detective-crime
                  drama (with subtitles), based upon the first of author Stieg
                  Larsson's successful, best-selling trilogy of crime novels
                  (the <i>Millennium</i> series), published posthumously from
                  2005-2007: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who
                  Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.
                  An English-language remake, <i>The Girl with the Dragon
                    Tattoo (2011)</i>, starred Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.
                    In both versions, the main protagonists were Lisbeth Salander
                  (Noomi Rapace), a misfit computer hacker, and journalist
                  Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), who worked on a dark case
                  involving a missing girl from almost 40 years earlier. In late
                  2002 in Stockholm, disgraced and discredited leftist
                  journalist and <i>Millennium</i> magazine author Mikael
                  Blomkvist - after losing a case of libel against him, was
                  hired by wealthy industrialist CEO and elderly patriarch
                  Henrik Vanger (Sven-Bertil Taube), part of a family clan that
                  were known as Nazi sympathizers. The possible case of murder
                  involved the disappearance of Henrik's then 16 year-old niece
                  Harriet (Julia Sporre as teen) who had vanished during a family
                  gathering on Children's Day in 1966 at his estate's remote
                  island many decades earlier. Blomkvist was assisted in the
                  case by mysterious, socially-estranged, black leather-clad,
                  Goth-like, tattooed freelance computer hacker Lisbeth
                  Salander. Meanwhile, Salander was being victimized by a
                  corrupt, sadistic, and perverted government official named
                  Nils Bjurman (Peter Andersson), and eventually found the
                  opportunity to exact sweet revenge upon him. During their
                  research, the two sleuths began to unravel a gruesome,
                  secretive and dysfunctional Vanger family with clues from old
                  photographs, newspapers, and archival materials. Their lives
                  became endangered as they unearthed damaging evidence of
                  racism, anti-Semitism, sexual assault, degeneracy, and
                  torture. The major suspects were Henrik's reclusive
                  sole-surviving brother Harald (Gosta Bredefeldt), Harriet's
                  mother, and other family members. In the film's conclusion,
                  Harriet's brother Martin Vanger (Peter Haber) was revealed
                  as a serial rapist-killer who had unsuccessfully attempted
                  to eliminate Harriet to enhance his inheritance. Journalist
                  Blomkvist was captured by Martin and threatened with hanging,
                  but Salander arrived, rescued him and pursued Martin on her
                  motorcycle before witnessing his death in a fiery crash.
                  Harriet (Ewa Froling as adult), who had been the victim of
                  repeated rape and cruelty from her own father Gottfried Vanger
                  (Henrik's brother) and Martin, was discovered living in
                  Australia. She had taken the alias name Anita, the name of
                  her now-deceased cousin who had helped her to escape her awful
                  situation (after she had retaliated and drowned her father
                  a year earlier). She returned to Sweden to reunite with her
                  uncle Henrik. The ending also included the vindication of
                  3-month imprisoned Blomkvist after he wrote an incriminating
                  expose story in <i>Millennium</i> revealing the criminality
                  of billionaire financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Stefan Sauk)

                  aftermath of a wild night, they awoke the next morning from
                  their misadventures with severe hangovers, and no memory of
                  what had happened, due to Alan who later admitted that he had
                  spiked their drinks with a date-rape drug. In their trashed
                  Caesar's Palace hotel suite, they found a Bengal tiger in the
                  bathroom, a chicken in the living room, and a six-month old
                  baby in a closet. Stu was missing a tooth (he had ripped out
                  his own tooth  with pliers), and Doug was absent - with
                  only 48 hours before his wedding nuptials in Los Angeles to
                  his bride Tracy (Sasha Barrese), Alan's sister. In the quasi-detective
                  story, the trio set out to find Doug, and to retrace their
                  steps and discover what they had experienced - under strange
                  circumstances, including boxer Mike Tyson (as Himself) and
                  his stolen pet tiger, a stolen police department cruiser, Stu's
                  wedding chapel marriage to a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham),
                  a threatening, naked Chinese gangster in their trunk named
                  Mr. Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), and an abducted 'Doug' that required
                  a ransom of $80,000, but it was the wrong Doug. In fact, Doug
                  was found on the roof of the casino/hotel where he had slept
                  the night on a mattress. He had thrown the mattress from the
                  roof to signal for help, and it had become  impaled on a Caesar
                  statue. In the conclusion, the group arrived late back in LA
                  to gather for the wedding. Stu's digital camera with photos
                  of their mishaps from the
                  previous night ended the film.</font></p>            </td>

                  minutes, D: David Yates<br />
                  This film was the 6th installment of the eight-film <a href="series-harrypotter.html"><em>Harry
                  Potter</em></a> franchise series. It was based upon J.K. Rowling's
                  6th book of the same name published in 2005. In this fantasy
                  adventure film, Harry Potter (Daniel Ratcliffe) returned for
                  his 6th year at Hogwarts for wizard-training. He soon learned
                  that classmate Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) was a possible Death
                  Eater and had been given a secret mission and assignment to
                  carry out by the evil Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph
                  Fiennes). At school, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)
                  announced that Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) would teach Defence
                  Against the Dark Arts, while his old friend Professor Horace
                  Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) had returned to the school to teach
                  Potions. In his class with Slughorn, Harry acquired a mysterious,
                  annotated school textbook (with notes and spells) and with
                  the inscription:
                  &quot;This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince.&quot; He
                  was able to learn much about the past of his major nemesis,
                  Lord Voldemort. Meanwhile, Harry was working with his mentor
                  Headmaster Dumbledore, and using the Pensieve to retrieve and
                  examine memories of people from Voldemort's past, when he was
                  personified as young wizard Tom Riddle. Harry learned from
                  Slughorn that Riddle had split his soul and hidden various
                  parts in Horcruxes to make himself immortal. The only method
                  to destroy the Dark Lord was to destroy the Horcruxes. Meanwhile,
                  Harry's friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger
                  (Emma Watson) were slowly showing their feelings for each other,
                   while Harry was interested in Ron's younger
                  sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright). At the
                  end of the year, Harry and Dumbdore visited a cave to retrieve
                  one of the remaining four Horcruxes, Slytherin's Locket. Back
                  at Hogwarts, the two ascended the school's tower where they
                  were confronted by Draco, whose intention was to kill Dumbledore.
                  When he balked, Snape murdered Dumbledore instead with a killing
                  curse. Snape was revealed to be the Half-Blood Prince. The
                  threesome, Ron, Harry, and Hermione decided to  forego their
                  final year at Hogwarts in order to track down the remaining
                  Horcruxes. </font></p>              </td>

                  minutes, D: Kathryn Bigelow<br />
                  This low-budget, fact-based, action-oriented war-thriller and
                  drama was a major award-winner, scoring Oscars for Best Picture
                  and a milestone Best Director Oscar win for Kathryn Bigelow.
                  This fictional character study was 
                  based upon the actual experiences of
                  freelance journalist and screenwriter/producer Mark Boal who
                  was embedded for two weeks with Army EOD soldiers in 2004 in
                  the Middle East. Also set in the year 2004, the violent film
                  told about an elite group known as the Army Explosives Ordinance
                  Demolition (EOD) team, whose three bomb-squad specialists
                  defused and detonated dangerous IEDs in Bagdad, Iraq. Alongside
                  Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge
                  (Brian Geraghty) was a new team leader (after the previous
                  Staff Sergeant was killed by an IED). The replacement leader
                  was reckless, risk-taking, maverick newcomer Army Staff Sergeant
                  First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), who was often at
                  odds with his squad-mates. During tense bomb defusements, the
                  group also had to be on the lookout for insurgent snipers from
                  every angle. One of the most intense sequences was a failed
                  attempt by James to remove a bomb vest strapped onto the chest
                  of an innocent Iraqi civilian. The effects of the stressful
                  war for James were also felt on the homefront, when he returned
                  home on leave to awkwardly experience routine civilian life
                  with his ex-wife Connie James (Evangeline Lilly) and their
                  infant son.</font></p>            </td>

                  152 minutes, D: Quentin Tarantino<br />
              Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's bloody WWII war and adventure
              film was not a remake of Italian director Enzo G. Castellari's
              combat film <i>The Inglorious Bastards (1978, It.)</i> even though
              the two films had basically the same title. The film's alternate
              history was structured with two main parallel plots that converged
              - both depicting secret Resistance efforts to assassinate Nazi
              leaders and attack German troops in Nazi-occupied France. Set in
              1944, the first effort was by &quot;The
              Basterds&quot; - a commando team of eight Jewish-American soldiers
              led by redneck Lieutenant Aldo &quot;The Apache&quot; Raine
              (Brad Pitt), who terrorized and demoralized German troops by cold-bloodedly
              executing them by scalping. The second effort was led by a young
              French-Jewish theatre owner in Paris named Shosanna Dreyfus (M&eacute;lanie
              Laurent), alias named Emmanuelle Mimieux. The central convergence
              point was refugee Shosanna's Parisian cinema house, where she had
              agreed to host the premiere of famed German army sniper-turned-actor
               Fredrick Zoller's (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) Nazi propaganda film -<i> Stolz
              der Nation (The Nation's Pride)</i>. As background, 
              in the film's opening tense sequence, the genial and calm but ruthless
              SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), known as &quot;The Jew
              Hunter,&quot; had executed Shosanna's entire Jewish family in 1941
              (he discovered that they were hiding under the floorboards in a
              French dairy farmer's home). Ever since, she had sought revenge
              on the sadistic Landa and other Nazis, and found her chance with
              the upcoming film event. Landa was appointed to be in charge of
              security for the German film's premiere, that would include many
              members of the German High Command in the audience. Shosanna's
              own vengeful, self-destructive plan, plotted with her Afro-French
              lover and projectionist Marcel (Jacky Ido), was to set the cinema
              on fire during the premiere and kill the top-ranking SS officers
              and Nazi leaders in attendance, including Adolf Hitler (Martin
              Wuttke) himself. Another attack on the cinema house was being planned
              (as Operation Kino) by British paratrooper Lieutenant Archie Hicox
              (Michael Fassbender) in cooperation with the Basterds. The British
              efforts would be aided by turncoat German film star Bridget von
              Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), an undercover Allied spy-agent, who
              was planning on attending the premiere in Paris. In the film's
              tumultuous, explosive and incendiary climax, all of the opposing
              forces came together at the cinema house. Zoller and Shosanna fought
              each other in the projection booth and both died, just before the
              theatre-house was set on fire by burning highly-flammable nitrate
              film behind the screen. Two of the Basterds submachine-gunned both
              Hitler and Joseph Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) and others before
              the whole structure was blown up with dynamite - killing everyone.
              Due to a previous underhanded deal to save his life, Landa had
              been provided safe passage by Raine, although
              &quot;The Apache's&quot; final act was to brand Landa's forehead
              with a carved swastika &quot;masterpiece&quot;, using his own customized
              Bowie knife.</font></p>              </td>

                  This street-smart independent film - a harsh but inspirational
                  teen drama, was a milestone in the history of African-American films and filmmakers.
                  It was the first-ever Best Picture nominee to be directed by
                  an African-American filmmaker, Lee Daniels, who also received
                  his first Best Director nomination. Geoffrey Fletcher (who
                  wrote the best-selling 1996 novel of the same name) also became
                  the first black scriptwriter to win the Oscar for Best Screenplay.
                  Set in NYC's Harlem ghetto in the year 1987, the title character
                  was 16-year-old junior high school student Claireece &quot;Precious&quot;
                  Jones (Gabourey Sidibe in her film debut) - an obese and illiterate
                   girl who was  incestuously pregnant a second time (by her
                   biological father Carl's frequent rape since the age of 3).
                   Her first infant daughter, named Mongo, was afflicted with
                   Down Syndrome, and was cared for by her grandmother. Despairing,
                   unloved, and often bullied, &quot;Precious&quot; lived in a tenement
                   apartment with  her vicious, game-show TV-addicted, chain-smoking, mentally-ill, unemployed
                   mother Mary Lee Johnston (Oscar-winning Mo'Nique) who  verbally,
                   emotionally and physically abused her, and was an expert at
                   welfare fraud. Nonetheless, in delusional fantasy sequences,
                   the overwhelmed &quot;Precious&quot; day-dreamed about a fantasy world
                   where she was safe. She imagined being a photo-shoot cover-girl
                   and video star on BET Magazine. While overseen by supportive
                   welfare caseworker Ms. Weiss (singer Mariah Carey), she was
                   transferred to the Reach One Teach One alternative school
                   due to her pregnancy. There she received promising, empathic
                   encouragement from her school's English teacher Ms. Blu Rain
                   (Paula Patton) (and her live-in female partner), to help improve
                   herself (by becoming literate) and to find self-determination,
                   transformation and liberation. She also received kindness
                   from a hospital nursing assistant John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz)
                   who she met during her delivery. Slowly and gradually through
                   persistence, &quot;Precious&quot; began to improve and break the cycle
                   of abuse, by separating from her damaging home life, and by
                   acquiring a high-school diploma equivalency by completing
                   a GED test. </font></p>              </td>

                  minutes, D: Ethan and Joel Cohen<br />
                  The dark comedy directed by the Coen Brothers was set in the
                  year 1967 in suburban St. Louis Park, Minnesota in the Midwest,
                  where the main protagonist lived. Beleaguered,
mild-mannered, Job-like, middle-class Jewish, university physics professor  Lawrence
                  &quot;Larry&quot; Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) was confronted
                  by a series of unexpected batterings, afflictions, trials and
                  tormenting tribulations that disrupted his staid and ordinary
                  life. His matronly, discontented and adulterous wife Judith
                  (Sari Lennick) was seeking a divorce and having an affair with
                  overbearing, erudite, and unctuous widower Sy Ableman (Fred
                  Melamed). At the same time, Larry was receiving high-priced
                  consultation with his own pessimistic, expensive divorce lawyer
                  Don Milgram (Adam Arkin). Meanwhile, a disgruntled South Korean
                  student Clive Park (David Kang) sent him a letter
                  containing bribe money, to change his
                  mid-term grade from an F to passing (and there were additional
                  threats of a lawsuit by the student's father (Steve Park)).
                  In the midst of receiving imminent tenure consideration, he
                  was given unofficial warnings from the chairman of the committee,
                  Arlen Finkle (Ari Hoptman), that anonymous letters had been
                  received referring to his &quot;moral turpitude&quot; - potentially
                  sabotaging his chances. On top of all these major problems,
                  his indebted, marijuana-smoking son Danny (Aaron Wolff) was
                  preparing for an expensive bar-mitzvah, and his rebellious,
              self-centered eldest daughter Sarah (Jessica McManus) was stealing
              money from his wallet for a desired nose-job. Larry's wife emptied
                  his bank account, and forced him to move out of the house to
                  a nearby <i>Jolly
                  Roger</i> Motel,
                  taking along his own socially-inept, ailing, unemployed loser
                  brother Arthur (Richard Kind), while a property line
              dispute was occurring with Larry's redneck, anti-semitic neighbor
              Mr. Brandt (Peter Breitmayer). In addition, 
              Larry's nude-sunbathing, next door neighbor Mrs. Vivienne Samsky
              (Amy Landecker) provocatively offered to smoke a
              joint with him in her home. His uncertain, upturned life caused
                  Larry to meet with rabbis to unsuccessfully question his faith
                  and his treatment by Hashem (aka God), and to plead for them
                  to help. When his wife's adulterous-partner Sy died in a car
                  crash, Larry was forced to finance the funeral. The film ended
                  with a closing call from Larry's doctor to ominously discuss
                  recent X-rays, while a threatening tornado approached.</font></p>            </td>

                  This sci-fi action film was the first of a trilogy of revived,
                  resurrected and rebooted <i>Star
                  Trek</i> films (set in an alternate-reality Kelvin Timeline),
                  followed by  <a href="series-startrek12.html"><i>Star
                  Trek Into Darkness (2013)</i></a> and <a href="series-startrek13.html"><i>Star
                  Trek Beyond (2016)</i></a>. It was the 11th film in the entire  <a href="series-startrek.html"><em>Star
                  Trek</em></a> feature-film franchise-series that began in 1979. This reinvented
                  film featured a   new cast that portrayed the crew of the
                  original TV show series (first airing in 1966), and it served
                  as a prequel of the original series. The film opened in the
                  year 2233 with an attack upon the <i>USS Kelvin</i>, a Federation
                  starship, by the <i>Narada</i> - a Romulan space mining vessel 
				  commanded by villainous Captain
                  Nero (Eric Bana). First Officer George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth)
                  sacrificed himself in order to allow the evacuation and abandonment
                  of his damaged ship (while crashing it into the <i>Narada</i>),
                  thus saving his crew and wife Winona (Jennifer Morrison) who
                  was giving birth to their son James T. Kirk. 17 years later
                  on the planet Vulcan, young Spock (Zachary Quinto) - due to
                  his mixed heritage, joined the research and peace-keeping space-force
                  known as the Starfleet Academy as a Lieutenant. At the same
                  time, grown-up, rebellious James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) also
                  enlisted in the Starfleet Academy. Within a few years, they
                  found themselves onboard Captain Christopher Pike's (Bruce
                  Greenwood) ship, the newly-commissioned <i>USS
                  Enterprise</i>, serving with other novice cadet recruits including communications
                  officer Nyota Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Dr. Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy
                  (Karl Urban), helmsman Hikaru Sulu (John Cho), and navigator
                  Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin). The ship
                  received a distress signal and was sent to investigate a seismic &quot;lightning
                  storm&quot; observed near Vulcan - a trap similar to the one that engulfed the <i>USS
                  Kelvin</i> decades earlier. The time-traveling  (from the future)
                  Romulun Captain Nero was engaged in a mission of vengeance
                  against the United Federation of Planets, by forming an artificial
                  black hole to destroy the planet Vulcan by implosion. He took
                   Capt. Pike hostage aboard the <i>Narada</i>, with plans to
                  target Earth next - at San Francisco's headquarters of Starfleet.
                   The conflict ended when Kirk and Spock, with the help of transporter
                  expert Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott
                  (Simon Pegg), beamed  aboard the <i>Narada</i>, rescued
                  Captain Pike, returned to the <i>Enterprise</i>, and
                  saved Earth. On board the disintegrating <i>Narada</i>,
                  Nero was consumed by the gravitational pull of a black hole.
                  In the epilogue back on Earth, Kirk was commended, promoted,
                  and given command of the <i>Enterprise</i>,
              with Spock as his First Officer. </font></p>              </td>

                  This violent and dark PG-13 sci-fi action film was the 4th
                  installment of the entire  <a href="series-terminator.html"><em>Terminator</em></a>
                  franchise-series. It was both a sequel to <i><a href="series-terminator3.html">Terminator
                  3: Rise of the Machines (2003)</a></i> and a prequel to the
                  first film - <i><a href="series-terminator.html">The
                  Terminator (1984)</a></i>. There was no sequel to this film
                  - it was followed by a planned rebooted trilogy, composed of <i>Terminator
                  Genisys (2015)</i> and <i>Terminator: Dark Fate (2019). </i>In
                  the film's  prologue set in the year 2003, condemned prisoner
                  on death-row Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) volunteered his
                  body to scientific medical research conducted by Cyberdyne
                  Systems. One year later, Skynet's machine-intelligent
                  network successfully eradicated humans with a nuclear
                  holocaust on &quot;Judgment Day.&quot; The
                  film then jumped ahead to the post-apocalyptic year of 2018,
                  when a war was being waged by grown-up John Connor (Christian
                  Bale), a lead member of the Resistance, against Skynet. After
                  a destructive raid on a Skynet machine base, sole-surviving Connor
                  learned about plans to harvest humans in order to engineer
                  a new Terminator T-800 model - a half-human, half-machine.
                  After leaving, a mysterious and strange naked figure emerged
                  from the wreckage - it was Wright suffering from amnesia, whose
                  last memory was his impending execution. What was his mission,
                  and where was he sent from? He proceeded toward Los Angeles.
                  Within four days, Connor and the Resistance fighters were to
                  target Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco. Connor was second
                  on the list of Resistance leaders on Skynet's kill-list, just
                  behind young freedom fighter Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) - who
                  was destined to time-travel back years earlier to 1984 to become
                  John's father after protecting John's mother Sarah Connor.
                  A few days later in the film, Wright (who was discovered to
                  be a cyborg - a Human-Terminator hybrid experiment) teamed
                  up with Connor on the eve of the planned Resistance attack
                  on Skynet. Wright agreed to help rescue abducted Kyle and other
                  human prisoners from Skynet, including a mute child named Star (Jadagrace
                  Berry). During the assault on Skynet, Wright learned that he had been
                  pre-programmed by Skynet to lure Connor to his death. Wright
                  ripped out his connective hardware, and assisted Connor to
                  battle the new T-800 Terminator. Connor was stabbed in the
                  chest, but Wright came to his defense by beheading the Terminator.
                  The two were still able to destroy the Skynet base, steal stockpiled
                  weapons and other cyborgs, before their airlift-escape. Wright
                  sacrificed his own heart to be transplanted into Connor's body
                  to save his life - to continue the Resistance freedom
                  war.</font></p>              </td>

                    (2009),</strong> 144 minutes, D: Michael Bay<br />
                    Director Michael Bay's sci-fi action film was the second
                    installment (and first sequel) of the live-action <i>Transformers</i> series-franchise,
                    beginning with <i>Transformers (2007)</i>. It was the top-performing
                    (domestic) film of 2009, while <i>Avatar (</i>also dated <i>2009)</i> was
                    the highest-grossing (domestic) film of 2010. Bay directed
                    the first five films through  <i>Transformers:
                    The Last Knight (2017)</i>. The American/Japanese media franchise,
                    originally a line of toys, told of
                    sentient, living, giant autonomous robots (Autobots,
                    Decepticons, etc.), who battled each other. The robots were
                    known as Transformers because they could transmute into vehicles,
                    planes, animals, and other objects. In this sequel two years
                    after the preceding film, college freshman Sam Witwicky (Shia
                    LaBeouf) was preparing to attend school, which meant he would
                    leave behind his girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) and
                    robotic guardian Bumblebee. His plans were disrupted by an
                    ongoing war between the noble Autobots (with their home planet
                    of Cybertron), led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the
                    evil Decepticons, led by Megatron (Hugo Weaving) and his
                    aide Starscream (Charlie Adler). The Autobots were allied
                    with an elite military task force known as NEST (Non-biological
                    Extraterrestrial Species Treaty) to hunt down any remaining
                    Decepticons. Sam realized, because of strange visions of
                    Cybertronian symbols, that he was being pulled into the middle
                    of the conflict. Ancient mysteries had been implanted into
                    his mind by a shard or splinter of the now-destroyed Allspark.
                    Sam realized he was being targeted and hunted by the ancient
                    Decepticons, under the orders of an ancient vengeful Decepticon
                    named &quot;The Fallen&quot; (Tony Todd) who
              had returned to Earth. &quot;The Fallen&quot; wanted access to
              Sam's mind, where imprinted glyphs and a riddle would lead to the
              location of the all-important Matrix of Leadership, that was ultimately
              found by Sam at Petra. Also hidden for centuries inside one of
              the Egyptian pyramids was an alien-constructed Sun-Harvesting machine
              that would provide the Decepticons with a new Energon source. If
              activated by the Matrix of Leadership, the Harvester was capable
              of destroying the Sun and all life on Earth. There were violent
              attempts by the Decepticons to force Sam to give them the Matrix,
              and although he was killed, he and Optimus Prime were revived and
              strengthened to destroy the activated Sun Harvester. &quot;The
              Fallen&quot; was vanquished and Megatron
              was forced to retreat, vowing future vengeance.</font></p>              </td>

                  130 minutes, D: Chris Weitz<br />
                  The second film in the five-film <i>Twilight</i> series-franchise
                  was another vampire romantic fantasy, based upon author Stephenie
                  Meyer's second (of four) novels, <i>New Moon</i> published
                  in 2006. It served as the sequel to <i>Twilight (2008)</i>.
                  All of the adapted films and books told about the star-crossed,
                  forbidden romance that developed between  teenager Isabella &quot;Bella&quot; Swan
                  (Kristen Stewart) from Forks, WA who fell in love with
                  Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), an immortal 104-year-old
                  vampire stuck at the age of 17. During a private birthday party
                  with the Cullens, Edward's blood-lusting foster brother Jasper
                  Hale/Cullen (Jackson Rathbone) threatened to attack Bella when
                  she bled from a paper cut, but she was saved when he was restrained.
                  The heartbroken high-school senior was further dismayed when
                  the Cullens decided to move from Forks, WA for her safety,
                  and her true love Edward broke off their relationship. She
                  went into a deep depression and a period of self-destruction
                  for months. Bella learned that if she acted recklessly, she
                  would see a thrill-induced vision of Edward cautioning her
                  to be careful. On the rebound, she took comfort and solace
                  by renewing her friendship with childhood friend Jacob Black
                  (Taylor Lautner) from the Quileute tribe, who helped her through
                  many dark months, but their closeness was hampered by Jacob's
                  jealousy of Bella's past association with the blood-sucking
                  clan. In a forest meadow, she happened to stumble across former
                  vampire adversary Laurent Da Revin (Edi Gathegi), vengeful
                  Victoria Sutherland's (Rachelle Lefevre) partner. When he threatened
                  to attack, a wolf pack appeared and rescued her. It was revealed
                  to her that Jacob and his tribe were shape-shifting werewolves.
                  Through a series of miscommunications, Edward came to believe
                  that Bella had died in a cliff-diving accident, and he sought
                  to end his life by having the Volturi (an ancient and powerful
                  Italian coven of vampire royalty) in Italy kill him. Bella
                  and Edward's sister Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) hurriedly
                  traveled to Italy to save Edward's life. The Volturi were impressed with Bella's
                  self-sacrificing nature, but realized that Bella (due to all
                  her knowledge of their existence) must either be killed or
                  soon transformed into a vampire, and Edward reluctantly agreed.
                  After returning to Forks, the Cullens took a vote on Bella's
                  transformation, with Edward voting no. Jacob reminded Edward
                  that the years-old treaty and truce between the vampires and
                  the Quileute tribe would be broken if any Cullen bit a human
                  (referring to Bella's 'turning'). In the cliff-hanger
                  ending, Edward promised to change Bella into a vampire under
                  one condition -- if they married. </font></p>              </td>

                One of the best animated films of all-time was this PG-rated,
                    universally-praised computer-animated adventure-comedy film
                    from Pixar/Disney Pictures - it was the 10th Pixar feature-length
                    film and one of the studio's highest-grossing films. The
                    film opened with a tearjerking montage sequence of an entire
                    decades-long marriage, from courtship to the death of the
                    wife. In the story, irascible septuagenarian Carl Fredricksen
                    (voice of Ed Asner), a balloon salesman, was married to his
                    younger tomboyish wife Ellie (voice of Elizabeth Docter)
                    who worked as a zookeeper. Their life's journey of growing
                    old included buying, restoring and fixing up a dilapidated
                    two-story home (soon threatened by encroaching city developers),
                    and dreaming about taking a vacation to exotic South America,
                    to journey to Venezuela's Paradise Falls. It had been described
                    by adventurer-explorer Charles Muntz (voice of Christopher
                    Plummer) as a beautiful place. One day, the retired widower
                    decided to fulfill a vow to his beloved late wife's dream
                    to visit the falls. He tied hundreds and hundreds of helium
                    balloons to his house that caused the structure to soar into
                    the air. He didn't realize a stowaway on his front porch
                    - a chubby, 8 year-old Wildlife Explorer scout named Russell
                    (voice of Jordan Nagai), was accidentally tagging along for
                    the ride. They arrived at Paradise Falls, where they encountered
                    a large, colorful flightless female bird (named &quot;Kevin&quot;)
                    (voice of Pete Docter), and Dug (voice of Bob Peterson) -
                    a talking golden retriever. They were also confronted by
                    a pack of three dogs, led  by
                    a Doberman Pinscher named Alpha  (also voice of
                    Bob Peterson), who took them to their elderly master Charles
                    Muntz, Carl's childhood idol. With his zeppelin-dirigible
                    airship named  <i>The Spirit of Adventure</i>, the obsessively-mad
                    Muntz claimed he was still searching for an elusive rare
                    bird (presumably
                &quot;Kevin&quot;) - revealing that he had evil intentions. Carl
                and Russell (with Dug) were able to evade Muntz, rescue Kevin
                and reunite her with her three chicks, and fly Muntz' dirigible
                back home with Muntz' three dogs. Russell was awarded his long-sought
                after 
                 &quot;Assisting the Elderly&quot; Scout merit badge to become
                 a Senior Wilderness Scout, while unbeknownst to Carl, his house
                 landed on the cliff overlooking Paradise Falls. </font></p>              </td>

                  minutes, D: Jason Reitman<br />
                  Director Jason Reitman's workplace-related comedy-drama  told
                  about a corporate, &quot;downsizing&quot; hatchet-man and HR consultant
                  with an itinerant, isolated lifestyle and little personal roots,
                  as he criss-crossed the country during a time of economic crisis.
                  The film's opening introduced Ryan Bingham (George Clooney),
                  an aloof, high-flying corporate down-sizer and consultant for
                  an HR company (Career Transition Counseling) who fired people.
                  He spoke in voice-over as he was in the midst of firing another
                  employee - an unfortunate man named Steve (Zach Galifianakis).
                  There were many repetitive scenes of Bingham's swift, highly-organized,
                  systematic, almost-choreographed packing of his carry-on suitcase
                  for his cross-country travels, and his equally-efficient passage
                  through the TSA checkpoint. There were three scenes of Ryan
                  delivering a motivational lecture on his keynote topic: &quot;What's
                  in Your Backpack?&quot;,
              in which he recommended stuffing all one's materialistic items
              into a backback - an escapist fantasy. In a hotel bar, Bingham
              instantly bonded with a like-minded 34 year-old soul - Alex Goran
              (Vera Farmiga), a savvy nomadic traveler (his mirror image) who
                  was also always on the road and mutually claimed with Bingham
                  that there were 'no strings attached'. He also led fast-rising,
                  ambitious, high-strung 23 year-old Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick)
                  on a typical road-trip of terminations to teach the inexperienced
                  newbie the art of firing someone, but she proved difficult
                  to train. And then Bingham himself was fired by his boss Bob
                  (J.K. Simmons), as the company transitioned from personal interactions
                  to mechanized firings via remote web-cam (known as GloCal video
                  conferencing) to slash expenditures. When Bingham realized
                  he didn't believe his own lecture's philosophy, he impulsively
                  flew to Chicago to visit Alex's home - and was shocked to see
                  that she was married with a family. He attained the milestone
                  of being the 7th (and youngest) individual to ever accumulate
                  10 million frequent-flier miles with American Airlines. In
                  the film's ending, the remote lay-off program was put on hold,
                  due to some upsetting suicides, and Bingham was rehired. Before
                  another round of trips, Bingham was  sitting
                  alone in his modest Omaha 'hotel room-like' apartment, staring
                  out.</font></p>
