          </b>This biographical musical documentary film was subtitled:
          &quot;The Story of Anvil&quot; - referring to  a
          little-known, influential Canadian heavy metal (or &quot;thrash metal&quot;)
          rock group that toured the world in the early 1980s, but never became
          commercially successful. Documentary filmmaker Sacha Gervasi (Anvil's
          ex-roadie and loyal fan) followed two members of the Anvil band to
          provide the film's content - sometimes described as a real-life version
          of <i>This is Spinal Tap (1984)</i>. Their first album, titled <i>Hard 'n' Heavy</i>,
          was released in 1981, and the group later came to be regarded as
          a substantial influence by some of the most successful rock groups
          at the time (Bon Jovi, Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Motorhead, Megadeth,
          etc.). The four-member group had a solid following of fans in Canada
          (and Toronto, their base), but they slumped creatively, only recorded
          on small independent labels, didn't have a manager and never
          found mainstream stardom or commercial success in the big-time. Anvil's
          two aging lead metal-heads: vocalist/guitarist Steve &quot;Lips&quot; Kudlow
          and drummer Robb Reiner, (both with menial, dead-end day jobs),
          were blindly determined and persistently optimistic to not
          let Anvil's R&amp;R dream die. They
          continued to record songs, play small clubs and sports bars in strip-malls,
          plan a major tour (a disastrous five-week European tour in 2006), and
          cut their comeback 13th album - with their own funding, over two
          decades after their initial appearance in the 1980s. </font></p>          </td>

				   <a href="series-chroniclesnarnia.html"><em>The
                  Chronicles of Narnia</em></a> franchise series (from 2005-2010),
                  based upon seven novels written by C.S. Lewis. All of the film's
                  were set in the fanciful world of Narnia, entered into through
                  a wardrobe. The film's opening was set one year after the previous
                  film. Although 12 months had passed in England (it was the
                  year 1942), it was 1,300 years later in the alternate-world
                  of Narnia, when the four Pevensie siblings had last visited.
                  The four children were (in descending order of age): Peter
                  (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund
                  (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgie Henley). In
                  Narnia, after the birth of Prince Caspian's (Ben Barnes) nephew
                  - a son born to his malicious, corrupt and power-hungry Uncle
                  King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) and Aunt Queen Prunaprismia
                  (Alicia Borrachero), the Prince, the rightful
                  heir to the Telmarine throne, was forced to flee for his life.
                  Now with a male heir, Miraz wanted to attain power. He sent
                  his military soldiers on horseback, led by General Glozelle
                  (Pierfrancesco Favino), after the exiled Prince who had headed
                  for the enchanted Shuddering Woods. The Prince blew on  
                  Susan's ancient, ornate magical ivory horn to seek help, and
                  to summon the Pevensie children (at a London subway station)
                  and all the old Narnians to assist him. He was helped by a
                  black-haired Narnian dwarf Nikabrik (Warwick Davis), a red
                  dwarf named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage), a badger Trufflehunter
                  (voice of Ken Stott), and later by a swashbuckling mouse named
                  Reepicheep (voice of Eddie Izzard). Impatient to wait for Narnia's
                  God-king Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) - a wise, noble and powerful
                  lion, to help in their struggle, the Narnians attacked Miraz's Telmarine castle, but
                  were brutally battered and defeated. Black sorcery was used
                  to summon a seductive White Witch (Tilda Swinton) (aka Queen
                  Jadis), an ancient power - that  turned out to be unwise. The
                  opposing forces met at Aslan's How (a huge underground hall
                  built atop the ancient Stone Table site), while Lucy and Susan
                  sought to locate Aslan. After a one-on-one duel between Miraz
                  and Peter, Miraz was defeated. Caspian spared Miraz' life,
                  but then Miraz's scheming general  Lord Sopespian (Dami&aacute;n
                  Alc&aacute;zar) suddenly betrayed Miraz - killing him with
                  a bow and arrow. He then blamed the Narnians in order to incite
                  a major battle between the opposing groups. The summoned Aslan
                  was able to quell the violent fighting with an army of animated
                  trees and an animated river, to vanquish the Telmarine army
                  (and Sopespian) and to compel their surrender. Prince Caspian
                  was installed as the rightful King of Narnia, to create a lasting
                  peace between Telmarines and Narnians.</font></p>          </td>

          This realistic
          slice-of-life docu-drama  
            was the first French film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film
            Festival in 21 years. It was based on the real-life memoirs of Fran&ccedil;ois
            B&eacute;gaudeau, a junior-high classroom teacher of the French language
            and literature, who was the film's scripter and main actor. He played
            a semi-autobiographical (or semi-fictional) version of himself as
            Fran&ccedil;ois Marin, a bright young, caring teacher in one of Paris' toughest,
            multi-cultural, inner-city public schools - an urban microcosm populated
            mostly by the working-class. During a year of teaching, although
            the embattled teacher struggled with his many foreign-born, racially-mixed,
            disruptive, unruly 'problem' students, Marin was intent on inspiring
            and challenging them to think and grow. A crisis developed when one
            of the rebellious, insolent and strong-headed pupils - the difficult,
            problematic and tempestuous Souleymane (Franck Keita) from Mali,
            caused a heated exchange in the class that led to teachers' evaluation
            meeting (attended also by student representatives), to decide placements,
            and discuss various issues with the multi-cultural students. The
            meeting brought out some of the teacher's own flaws (i.e., slang
            name-calling in a moment of anger), putting him to the test. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), </strong>167
              minutes, D: David Fincher<br />
          David Fincher's sweeping, lengthy, big-budget romantic-fantasy and
          dramatic epic, based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1922 jazz age short story,
          followed the life of 'curious' everyman Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt).
          Told in flashback, the title character was born in his elderly 80s
          and then began aging in reverse, growing younger rather than older.
          The inventive film deservedly won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects,
          for its miraculous age transformations of Button, who was born in 1918
          (on Armistice Day) and was first seen as a short, ailing, frail, 80
          year-old bald and wrinkled-skin elderly man with glasses. The old-man's-baby's
          biological mother Caroline Button (Joeanna Sayler) died during childbirth
          and the child was abandoned by his father Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng).
          He was brought up by African-American Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), an
          African-American servant who found him abandoned on the steps of her
           New Orleans nursing-retirement home. When Benjamin was 12 years old
          in 1930, he met his future lover/girlfriend, a young 7 year-old Daisy
          Fuller (Cate Blanchett as adult, Elle Fanning as 7 year old), who was
          the  grand-daughter of one of the retirement-home tenants. As he grew
          younger, Benjamin  joined kindly but crusty old Captain Mike Clark (Jared Harris) to work on
          his  tugboat. In the early 1940s, he briefly fell in love with unhappily-married
          British expatriate Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton), just before the
          Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in late 1941. Benjamin was part of
          the war effort when Capt. Clark's tugboat was employed by the US Navy
          in salvage operations. Eventually, in New Orleans, he developed a romantic
          relationship with Daisy (an accomplished ballet dancer) when they
          met at mid-age in the early-to-mid 1960s when he was chronologically
          in his late 40s. Daisy's pregnancy resulted in the birth of daughter
          Caroline (Shiloh Jolie-Pitt) in 1968 (named after Benjamin's mother),
          although she later married another man named Robert Williams (Rus Blackwell).
          [Note: The film's twist was Daisy's revelation
          on her New Orleans deathbed (during Hurricane Katrina in August of
          2005) where she was reading from Benjamin's diary. She told her 40-ish
          daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) that she was born out of wedlock,
          and had been fathered by Benjamin.] By the 1990s, Benjamin was now a pre-teen in poor
          physical health and suffering from early dementia. Daisy cared
           for Benjamin until his death in the year 2003, when he perished
          as an infant (at the age of 84 years) in her arms. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Christopher Nolan 
          <br />
          This darker and more violent film was the second entry in Christopher
          Nolan's trilogy of Batman superhero epics (preceded by<i> <a href="series-batman5.html">Batman
          Begins (2005)</a></i>, and followed by <i><a href="series-batman10.html">The
          Dark Knight Rises (2012)</a></i>) - part of the lengthy  
		  <a href="series-batman.html"><em>Batman</em></a> franchise-series.
          The popular sequel film topped the box-office charts as the highest-grossing
		  (domestic) film of 2008 and the highest-grossing (domestic) <i>Batman</i> movie
		  ever. The action-packed, blockbuster superhero crime-drama  was
		  based on the decades-old comic-book Caped Crusader figure of Gotham
		  City. Billionaire socialite playboy Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale)
		   (in a sleeker bat-suit for his nightly &quot;Dark Knight&quot; vigilante
		   duties), allied with Police Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman)
		   and idealistic DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to fight organized crime
		   in Gotham City, found themselves with a new nemesis - a villainous,
		   ghoulish, facially-scarred, terrorizing bank robber named the Joker
		   (Heath Ledger). [Note: Ledger's indelible, diabolical performance
		   was posthumously honored with an Oscar after he tragically died shortly
		   before the film's release.] The Joker planned and strategically executed
		   a series of  attacks against the city and its people to produce anarchy
		    and chaos, and  to confront
		   Dent and Batman. Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) served as Bruce's
		   butler and confidante, while Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), the twinkle-eyed,
		   trustworthy Wayne Enterprises inventor and head of the Applied Sciences
		   Dept., provided Wayne with the gadgets and equipment (i.e., the Batsuit,
		   the Tumbler, the Batpod) required for his exploits, Batman's version
		   of James Bond's Q. Also, he counseled him as a calm parental surrogate,
		   took over CEO responsibilities, and served as the film's moral or
		   ethical center when he expressed concern over Batman's invasive use
		   of surveillance technology. During a confrontation with the Joker,
		   Dent lost half his face (and acquired a new nickname Two-Face -  
		   turning him into a schizophrenic and vengeful murderer), and Bruce's
		   ex-girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) was killed. In a final
		   face-off, the Joker was apprehended, and a threatening Dent fell to
		   his death from a building. In the ending, Batman took the blame for the
		   current killing spree, to preserve Dent's reputation and heroic image, while
		   the police began to hunt down Batman. The final words were Gordon's
		   tribute to Batman: &quot;He's a silent Guardian. A watchful protector.

        <p><font size="2"><b>Doubt (2008)</b>, 104 minutes, D:  John Patrick Shanley<br />
        The major source  for this provocative, faith-based period-drama was
            writer/director John Patrick Shanley's 2004 Broadway play <i>Doubt:
            A Parable</i> 
            that ran on stage from 2004-2006. The play received two major awards:
            the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and Tony Award for Best Play, before
            becoming an Academy Awards-nominated film. The film's setting was
            the year 1964 at St. Nicholas - a Bronx (NY) Catholic  church
            parish middle school whose strict, strong-willed conservative principal,
             Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), ruled with rigid threats
            of punishment, discipline and fear. She was clearly at odds with
            the progressive, thoughtful, charming and charismatic priest of the
            church Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). In an attempt
            to adapt to changing times within its  Irish/Italian Catholic
            neighborhood (although realizing there
            would be some turbulence), the school had admitted its first African-American
            student Donald Miller (Joseph Foster). A feud between the self-righteous,
            old-school Sister and popular Father developed after well-meaning,
            naively-innocent history teacher, Sister James (Amy Adams) reluctantly
            reported to Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn and altar boy Donald
            were suspiciously seen meeting in the church rectory (with the smell
            of alcohol on Donald's breath). As time passed and without substantial
            evidence regarding their ambiguous meeting, the very suspicious and
            morally-certain Sister Aloysius began to believe that the allegedly-transgressing
            clergyman was a child-molesting pedophile. Flynn explained that he
            and the boy had met after Donald was caught drinking sacramental
            wine, and that he had kept it a secret to protect the boy. He then
            agreed the student should be dropped as an altar boy. However, the
            unconvinced Sister continued to resort to a crusade to persuade others
            of his inappropriate advances and have him expelled from the school.
            The situation became extremely complex when Donald's mother (Viola
            Davis) explained that her troubled son was gay, and had a violently-abusive
            homophobic father (Joseph Foster). The Sister began to threaten Flynn,
            claiming she had spoken to a nun at his last parish, and was planning  
            further visits to his past places of employment to dig up more 
            corroboration of her suspicions. She successfully forced Flynn to
            resign and face a transfer. Later, Sister Aloysius broke down and
            confessed to Sister James that she had lied to Flynn about his past
            infringements in order to rid the school of him. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Frost/Nixon (2008),</strong> 122 minutes,
        D: Ron Howard<br />
        Director Ron Howard's political docu-drama was based on the adaptation
        of Peter Morgan's own 2006 play. The title referred to the 12 Frost/Nixon
         interviews conducted from March-April 1977, ultimately consisting
        of four 90-minute programs recorded and broadcast on TV and radio in
        May of 1977. The initial episode drew 45 million
        viewers - an historically record-large TV audience for a political
        interview. British talk-show host David Frost (Michael Sheen)
        met with the disgraced former president Richard Nixon (Frank Langella),
        following three years of silence after Nixon had resigned in 1974 due
        to the 1972 Watergate scandal (break-in and cover-up) and his impeachment.
        It would be an opportunity for Nixon to air his grievances and exonerate
        himself, since he had never admitted any guilt or offered any apology
        or explanation in the interim. Nixon would  be paid a guaranteed
        $600,000 while also resurrecting his career. In preparation for the interviews,
        there were many behind-the-scenes power struggles. Two investigators
        were hired to dig up details of the Watergate incident - ABC News producer
        Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt) and author James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell).
        Charismatic TV show host Frost intended to subvert his 'soft' interview
        approach and reputation with hard-hitting questions, to hopefully encourage
        Nixon to confess to his crimes. The most dramatic scene was a late-night,
        deeply-personal phone call from a drunken Nixon to Frost about his past
        weaknesses and upbringing, and claims that he could hold his own and
        beat Frost in the final interview. At the end of the long series of questioning
        between the two men, their talks revealed an honest and truthful account.
        Nixon came to admit to his unethical wrong-doings (with the contradictory
        statement: &quot;I'm
        saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal!&quot;),
        and that he had let the American people down by the cover-up.</font></p>        </td>

          grim crime docudrama, an ensemble film based on the 2006 non-fiction

          about people's lives as they were drawn into violent criminal syndicate

              D: Clint Eastwood<br />
              Director/actor/producer Clint Eastwood's urban drama portrayed
              a prejudiced (or racist), recently-widowed Korean War vet named
              Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood), a retired assembly-line auto worker.
              Living in the once-peaceful white, working-class neighborhood of
              Highland Park, Michigan, a crime-ridden suburb of Detroit, the
              angry, quick-tempered and hard-drinking smoker was emotionally
              alienated from his family, and despised his poor Asian-immigrant
              neighbors. The embittered man's prized, dark-green metallic 1972
              Ford Gran Torino became the flash-point for a major clash between
              Walt and his young fatherless neighbor Thao Vang Lor (Bee Vang).
              The shy teenaged Hmong immigrant boy had been coerced by his cousin
              Fong &quot;Spider&quot; (Doua Moua), the local gang leader, 
			  into stealing the vehicle in
              order to be initiated into the local gang. After Walt hindered
              the theft, he also faced off against the gang's further retaliation
              and attack with his M1 Garand rifle - earning the respect of the
              entire local Hmong community for standing up against the threat.
              Subsequently, the boy's family forced the boy to repay Walt (and
              seek atonement) by doing work for him, and he reluctantly agreed
              to cooperate. Slowly, a mentoring, father-figure relationship developed
              with the boy and his family, and Thao's older sister Sue (Ahney
              Her). He helped them to reform, but they were still plagued by
              the gang's violent activities. By the film's conclusion, the retaliatory
              gang had shot and injured Thao, and kidnapped, beat and raped Sue.
              One-on-one at the gang's house, Walt confronted the gang and provoked
              them into lethally shooting him, even though he was unarmed. Many
              of the gang members were arrested and charged with murder. After
              his funeral attended by many Hmong community members, Walt's will
              bequeathed his beloved Gran Torino and Labrador Retriever Daisy
              to Thao. </font></p>        </td>

                  Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)</a>,</strong> 122
                  minutes, D: Steven Spielberg<br />
        Director Steven Spielberg's action-adventure film was the 4th 
        installment of the long-running <a href="series-indianajones.html"><em>Indiana
        Jones</em></a> franchise-series (from 1981 to 2008). Set in the year
        1957 during the Cold War, the opening introduced the film's villains
        - the Russians - led by agent-operative Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett)
        and her evil henchman Antonin Dovchenko (Igor Jijikine), who had infiltrated
        into a Nevada desert's secret military base and warehouse. Famed Marshall
        College archaeologist-adventurer Dr. Henry &quot;Indiana&quot; Jones,
        Jr. (Harrison Ford) escaped an atomic blast by hiding in a refrigerator
        localed in a nuclear test home. He then learned from motorcycle-riding
        greaser Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) that Mutt's surrogate father (and
        Indiana's previous colleague) Professor Harold &quot;Ox&quot; Oxley (John
        Hurt) had become demented 6 months earlier after discovering a rare,
        pre-Colombian artifact composed of a single piece of quartz. It was a
        mysterious, powerful crystal skull found hidden in the South American
        jungle, in the Temple of Akator (aka The Lost City of Gold or legendary
        city of El Dorado). Once they had arrived in Peru on a frantic
        search and race against the Soviets to locate the ancient pyramidal structure
        at Akator that held the crystal skulls, the two were taken captive
        by Indy's turncoat British partner George &quot;Mac&quot; Michale (Ray
        Winstone)  and the Soviets. They were joined
        up with two other prisoners, the insane Oxley and Indy's feisty ex-love
        interest Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) - who admitted that Mutt (Henry
        Jones III) was Indy's offspring. In the film's climactic and other-worldly
        finale set inside the ancient temple, obsessed Soviet agent Irina admitted
        her objective - to dominate the world telepathically by obtaining the
        great psychic powers of the Crystal Skulls. The temple housed 13 crystal
        skeletons (one with a missing  skull). Once Oxley's stolen skull was
        returned to the 10th skeleton, an extra-terrestrial life-form appeared
        who explained that the aliens long ago, seen as gods, had passed on their
        advanced technology and knowledge to the ancient civilizations. As Irina
        absorbed the knowledge, it killed her and the temple was sucked into
        an activated giant portal from another dimension, from which a flying
        saucer emerged before flying off. Indiana, Mutt, Marion and Oxley were
        the only ones to escape from the devastation. </font></p>          </td>

              Jon Favreau<br />
              This comic book-based, action-adventure superhero film was the
              first installment of <a href="superheroes-marvel.html"><i>Marvel's
              Cinematic Universe (MCU)</i></a>, and the first
          of a franchise-series of <i>Iron Man</i> films. Sequels followed: <i>Iron
          Man 2 (2010)</i> and <i>Iron Man 3 (2013)</i>. The film told the 'origin
          story' of superhero <i>Iron Man</i>. It opened with billionaire industrialist/engineer,
          flamboyant playboy, and philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.)
          in Afghanistan, to  demonstrate his company's latest project: the Jericho
          - an advanced super-missile system. The CEO heir to defense weapons-manufacturer
          Stark Industries, was seriously injured, kidnapped and taken captive
          by a terrorist group (the Ten Rings led by Raza (Faran Tahir)) and
          held in an Afghan cave. In exchange for his life, Stark agreed to build
          a Jericho missile for his captors. Instead, he built a mechanized (or
          robotic), invulnerable suit of armor that he used to facilitate his
          escape. After destroying the cave and launching himself away, Stark
          crashed in the desert, left his prototype suit behind, and was picked
          up by US helicopters. Upon his return home, Stark vowed to cease manufacturing
          weapons, and was determined to discover who was behind the conspiracy
          to acquire weapons. He conferred with his personal assistant Virginia &quot;Pepper&quot; Potts
          (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his second-in-command manager, Obadiah Stane
          (Jeff Bridges), his father's ex-partner, who opposed the financially-destructive
          change of direction for the company. Meanwhile, Stark secretly began
          to work on and test an advanced and streamlined version of his exo-skeleton
          armored suit, with a more powerful mini arc reactor (both a second-generation
          Mark II chestpiece, and then a Mark III). He flew to Afghanistan to
          defeat Raza and destroy any of the group's weapons. By the film's conclusion,
          it was revealed that Stane was double-crossing Stark by trafficking
          arms to the Ten Rings terrorist group in Afghanistan, and instigating
          a murderous coup to replace Stark as Stark Industries' CEO. When Stane
          found it impossible to reverse-engineer pieces of Stark's prototype
          Mark I suit from fragments in the desert, he confronted Stark and stole
          his newest, Mark II miniaturized arc reactor from his chest. Stark
          was able to acquire his own original Mark I arc reactor, and engaged
          in a fight-to-the-death against iron-clad Stane (in his own robotic
          suit code-named the Iron Monger) atop the Stark Industries building.
          Potts was able to create a power overload in the building's  arc reactor
          that produced a shock-wave to kill Stane. In the final scene, Stark
          publically admitted during a press conference that he was indeed the
          superhero Iron Man (&quot;I am Iron Man&quot;).</font></p>        </td>

            Komma In) (2008, Sweden)</b><br />
          This Swedish import - a coming-of-age
            romantic horror film by director Tomas Alfredson, 
           was a vampirish tale set in the early 1980s, although the word &quot;vampire&quot; was
           mentioned only once. Its title referred to vampire
          lore - that one had to specifically invite a vampire to cross the threshold
          to enter one's home. The dramatic film told about two 12 year-old
          neighbors in the year 1982: blonde, albinoid, remotely-passive and
          outcast schoolboy Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), and
          enigmatic, androgynous, dark-haired female Eli (Lina Leandersson),
          a nocturnal vampire. The two alienated, societal misfits developed
          a close friendship. Oskar
          lived with his divorced mother Yvonne (Karin Bergquist) near Stockholm
           (in Blackeberg) in an apartment known as the Centrum, and was badly
           tormented by a trio of bullies at school. Next door was Eli, living
           with her unsociable, older &quot;father&quot; figure
          or guardian named Hakan (Per Ragnar), an ancient vampire who provided
          her with blood (from his neck) from recent kills. Both threatened pre-teens
          gave each other comfort and friendship after connecting and &quot;going
            steady&quot; and then forming a &quot;blood bond.&quot; Eli counseled
            Oskar to find strength and take revenge on the bullies, while Oskar
            provided Eli with acceptance of her fated plight (she confessed &quot;I'm
            not a girl!&quot;
          and eventually admitted she was a vampire that needed to kill to survive).
          From the start, a series of bloody murders were being committed by
          an alleged serial killer, and the police were zeroing in on the killer.
          In the film's shocking conclusion, Eli came to Oskar's rescue in an
          attemped drowning by three main bullies at the local swimming pool,
          and killed (and  dismembered) the assailants. </font></p>        </td>

              D: Phyllida Lloyd<br />
              This escapist, feature-film musical romance-comedy was  inspired
              by two sources: the music of the Swedish 1970s hit-group ABBA,
              and screenplay-writer and author Catherine Johnson's book of the
              1999 Broadway musical of the same name. The exuberant story, set
              on the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi, centered on 20 year-old
              bride-to-be Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) who was about to
              be married to Sky Ramand (Dominic Cooper). Her real goal for the
              wedding was to identify her true father, with assistance from her
              bridesmaids Lisa (Rachel McDowell) and Ali (Ashley Lilley). She
              invited three strangers (located in the diary of her single mother
              Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep)) to attend her upcoming wedding:
              divorced, Irish-American architect Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan),
              British banker Harry Bright (Colin Firth), and Swedish
              traveler/writer Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd),
              hoping that one of them would potentially be her father from her
              mother's free-spirited, carefree and rebellious sexual past, and
              would walk her down the aisle. Donna was the proprietor/owner of
              a small, rustic hotel on the island known as the &quot;Villa
              Donna.&quot; She also invited
              two of her past, long-time singing friends to attend: unmarried
              author Rosie Mulligan (Julie Walters) and wealthy divorcee Tanya
              Chesham-Leigh (Christine Baranski), to recreate and perform as
              members of their former band known as Donna and the Dynamos. Donna
              was shocked, unhappy and confused to find her three past male lovers
              in attendance (that she had not seen for 20 years), and revealed
              that she did not know which one of them fathered Sophie. Complications
              ensued when all three of the men  publically proclaimed  
              that each of them was Sophie's father. In a last-minute switcheroo,
              Sophie's wedding to Sky was postponed temporarily so they could
              travel the world, and Sam proposed to Donna - to take their place
              in the wedding party. In the aftermath, Harry revealed he was gay,
              and Rosie hooked up with Bill.</font></p>        </td>

              Van Sant<br />
              Director Gus Van Sant's biographical drama, with flashbacks, explored
              the last eight years of the life of courageous civil and gay-rights
              activist Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) whose life ended tragically in
              November of 1978. Various sources for the film included Randy Shilts'
              1982 biography <i>The Mayor of Castro Street</i>, and the documentary film <i>The Times
              of Harvey Milk (1984)</i>. The film opened in New York City on
              the eve of closeted homosexual Harvey Milk's 40th birthday in 1970,
              when he became involved with Scott Smith (James Franco), his male
              lover. In 1972, the couple moved to San Francisco and opened a
              camera shop (Castro Camera) in the working-class, Castro Street
              area known for liberal attitudes toward gays. Milk became a devoted
              political activist-advocate for equal rights for all - and an outspoken
              proponent/leader of the gay-rights movement (dubbing himself
              &quot;The Mayor of Castro Street&quot;), although he faced continuing 
              discrimination. On his third attempt, he was elected in 1977 to
              San Francisco's Board of Supervisors (representing newly-zoned
              District 5), and became the first openly gay person to be elected
              to public office in California. During his duties, Milk met fellow
              Supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin), a conservative-leaning politician,
              who had served in Vietnam and previously worked as a police officer
              and firefighter. They clashed over their opposing views and styles
              of politicking. In particular, White opposed a city-wide gay rights
              ordinance, and supported Proposition 6, a state-wide initiative
              that banned gays and lesbians from working in California's public
              schools. At the same time, singer Anita Bryant was campaigning
              in Florida, with her national anti-gay organization <i>Save
              Our Children</i>, to defeat gay rights laws there. After Proposition 6 was defeated,
              White unleashed his frustrations and fury (about his job on the
              board) on both Milk and SF Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber),
              by entering City Hall with a gun and assassinating them. 30,000
              people came out to honor Milk that night with a candlelight vigil.
              With a &quot;Twinkie Defense,&quot; White served only about 5 years for manslaughter,
              and two years after his release committed suicide.</font></p>        </td>

        This was the 22nd installment of the long-running action-thriller  <a href="jamesbond.html"><em>James
        Bond</em></a> franchise-series, and a direct sequel to <a href="series-jamesbond21.html"><i>Casino
        Royale (2006)</i></a>. Daniel
        Craig starred in his second spy film as the famed 007 MI6 agent.  In
        this grim, dark and violent  film, Bond sought revenge after the death
        of his former lover/girlfriend Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) from the previous
        film. With MI6 head M (Judi Dench), he interrogated captured Mr. White
        (Jesper Christensen) about a corrupt and powerful criminal organization
        known as Quantum, before White orchestrated his escape with help from
        M's turncoat bodyguard. Bond traveled to Haiti where he met beautiful
        Camille Montes (Olga Kurylenko), a Bolivian secret service agent who
        was also seeking to avenge the murder of her own family. Shortly later,
        with the help of CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) and fellow agent
        Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton), Bond learned about wealthy environmentalist
        businessman Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), the head of an organization
        known as Greene Planet. He had been Camille's ex-lover, and  was the
        mastermind behind an international crime syndicate known as Quantum.
        Now a rogue agent, Bond realized that Greene's plan was to cause a regime
        change by deposing the current Bolivian leader and instigating a coup
        d'etat against the regime to take over the government. Greene was allied
        with exiled Bolivian General Medrano (Joaquin Cosio), the one responsible
        for the murder of Camille's family, and a strongman who would assume
        the leadership of Brazil. Their political upheavals were designed to
        acquire a seemingly-barren piece of worthless Bolivian Atacama desert
        land to seize control of its hidden, underground fresh water supply (not
        its oil supply), so that they would make a profit by selling the highly-inflated
        and valuable land back to the government. During the film's climactic
        confrontation in the desert  at an eco-hotel, the Perla des las Dunas,
        Camille vengefully shot and killed Medrano, and Bond left Greene
        stranded in the desert (with only a can of motor oil) after blowing up
        the complex. In the epilogue, M informed Bond that Greene was found dead
        in the middle of the desert, shot twice in the neck with some engine
        oil found in his stomach. She also invited  Bond to return to MI6. </font></p>        </td>

              D: Stephen Daldry<br />
          This highly acclaimed dramatic film  was a Holocaust love story, adapted
          by David Hare from Bernhard Schlink's 1995 neo-classic novel. Through
          a flashback to the summer of 1958, it told of an erotic, passionate and 
		  secret summer-time affair in post-WWII
            Berlin between uneducated, beautiful, hard-working and repressed
          36 year-old tram conductor Hanna Schmitz (Best Actress Oscar-winning
          Kate Winslet), and 15 year-old virginal German schoolboy Michael Berg
          (David Kross). They first met after a chance meeting when she helped him as he was suffering
            from the onset of scarlet fever. A few months later, she bathed
            him and dried him off, while nude herself, after he had dirtied
            himself with coal dust in her apartment's basement. Seducing him,
          they had intercourse and continued having sex on a regular basis, after
          which she demanded that he  read literature outloud to her: (<i>The
          Odyssey, Huckleberry Finn, </i>and<i> The
          Lady with the Little Dog</i>, among others). Later in 1966 when Michael
          (Ralph Fiennes as an adult) was a law student in Heidelberg, he learned
          the truth about Hanna's past. He witnessed her Nazi war-crimes
          trial for being an SS guard at a satellite of Auschwitz near Cracow
          during the war, and her harsh sentencing to life imprisonment. She
          had accepted the more severe charges against her for ordering the murder
          of hundreds of innocent Jews in a burning church, instead of admitting
          that she couldn't read or write a report about the incident. She hid
          the embarrassing personal fact that she was illiterate. In 1988 after
          almost twenty years in prison, Hanna was to be paroled in one week
          (an early release due to good behavior), and Michael saw her during
          a poignant, painful prison visit for the first time in decades. He
          had been sending her audio cassette tape recordings of his readings
          of her favorite books (and she had painstakingly taught herself how
          to read and write), fulfilling his role as &quot;The
          Reader.&quot; When he returned a week later to pick her up, he sadly learned that she
          had committed suicide in her room, by standing on a stack of books
          and hanging herself. In the film's final scene in a steady rain, the
          heartbroken Michael took his grown-up daughter Julia (Hannah Herzsprung)
          to visit Hanna's grave in a church graveyard.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Revolutionary Road (2008, US/UK),</b> 119 minutes,
              D: Sam Mendes<br />
          This adult-oriented marital drama, adapted from Richard Yates'
          1961 debut novel, captured the life-draining, conformist zeitgeist
          of the mid-1950s in its story of a troubled and disintegrating
          marriage. [Note: The film reunited the two star-crossed lovers from <i>Titanic (1998)</i>.]
          Husband Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) found him trapped in an unrewarding,
          tedious, humdrum NYC business machine position (at Knox Machines).
          The discontented Frank took the long train trip each workday to
          the city where he passed through a sea of gray-flannel-clad workers
          in Grand Central Station. He was also involved
          in an unhappy, bleak and miserable marriage with April (Kate Winslet)
          and their family of two children, their son Michael (Ty Simpkins) and
          their daughter Jennifer (Ryan Simpkins). Likewise, she felt destined
          to a life of domestic servitude who had forsaken all of her youthful
          aspirations and dreams to be an actress. The two lived in a picture-perfect
          western Connecticut house (on Revolutionary Road), a suburb, fulfilling
          the American middle-class dream. Turning 30, however, Frank engaged
          in a short sexual affair with co-worker secretary Maureen Grube (Zoe
          Kazan). Meanwhile, in a wild fantasy, the couple hoped to leave behind
          their hopeless, conformist and empty suburban life by selling their
          home and moving to Paris at the end of summer, and excitedly told their neighbors. 
		  But then their hopes for a change were sidetracked when reality set in. Frank
          was tempted to accept an unexpected promotion (with a larger sustainable salary)
          and April became pregnant again - at the 10-week mark. Frustrated and
          depressed about her monotonous and boring life, and the cancellation-loss
          of their Paris dream, April turned to a fling with married neighbor 
		  Shep Campbell (David Harbour). Subsequently,
          the desperate April, who no longer felt love for Frank, made an attempt
           to perform a vacuum aspiration abortion
          on herself, with deadly consequences.</font></p>        </td>

              D: Danny Boyle<br />
              Best Picture and Best Director-winning Danny Boyle's
              dark horse, low-budget crowd-pleasing Bollywood-Hollywood hybrid
              had no American superstars, lots of foreign-language dialogue,
              and exhibited the extreme poverty of Bombay (Mumbai) India. The
              inspirational 'feel-good' theme, romantic sub-plot, and Oscar-winning
              song/dance &quot;Jai Ho&quot; finale made it extremely popular.  The urban drama told
              in flashback about events in the life of impoverished, slum-dwelling
              18 year-old orphaned and illiterate &quot;slumdog&quot; thief
              Jamal Malik (Dev Patel). The honest, good-hearted teen was working
               as a tea service worker (Chaiwala) for a telecommunications company's
              call center, when he appeared in the year 2000 as a contestant
              on a TV game-show titled <i>Kaun Banega Crorepati</i> (the Indian
            version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;), with 60 million
            viewers.  When only one question away from winning the top prize of 20 million rupees,
            he was arrested for cheating (presumably
            due to his unsavory, lower-class background). As he explained how he
            knew the answers to the previous questions, the flashback began.
            He was an orphaned young boy (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar as child) with
            his older brother Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail as child, Madhur
            Mittal as grown-up), growing up in poverty after their mother was
            killed during Bombay riots (and attacks on Muslims) in early 1993.
            Adopting a life of petty crime, they joined up with another young
            girl on the streets named Latika (Rubina Ali as child, Freida Pinto
            as grown-up). During a varied series of misadventures as they became
            teenagers, including Latika being taken in to be trained as a prostitute,
            Jamal fell in love with Latika, but had become separated from her.
            By being on the game show, he knew she would be watching him. He
            was able to answer the increasingly-tough questions due to his past
            circumstances, as explained in the flashbacks. When he answered the
            last question correctly - the name of the Third Musketeer (Aramis)
            in Alexandre Dumas' 1844 novel <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, Jamal was
            happily reuinted with Latika on the platform of the VT (Victoria
            Terminus) train station in Mumbai, where they danced to &quot;Jai Ho.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Twilight (2008),</strong> 121 minutes, D:
              Catherine Hardwicke<br />
              This romantic fantasy vampire film was the first of five films
              in a long-running <i>Twilight Saga</i> franchise-series (from 2008-2012).
              It was an adaptation based upon the first of four novels published
              from 2005-2008 by author Stephenie Meyer. The best-selling books
              followed teenaged 17 year-old Isabella &quot;Bella&quot; Swan
              (Kristen Stewart) who had recently moved to the small town of
              Forks, WA from Phoenix, AZ with her single parent father Charlie
              (Billy Burke), Forks' new Chief of Police. There, she entered into
              a problematic romance with 108-year-old, telepathic Edward Cullen
              (Robert Pattinson), immortally-stabilized in age as a teenager
              and a member of a dangerous coven of vampires. She also established
              a relationship with her childhood friend, Native-American (Quileute)
              teenager Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) who lived with his father
              Billy Black (Gil Birmingham) on a reservation. The Quileutes, descended
              from wolves, were enemy-rivals of the Cullens. Unlike most thirsty,
              blood-sucking vampires, the Cullens were &quot;vegetarians&quot; (who
			  consumed non-human, animal blood) in
              order to co-exist with humans. However, Bella became endangered
			  by the arrival in Forks of three rival, rogue and nomadic vampires:
               gifted tracker and sadistic hunter James Witherdale (Cam Gigandet),
               his partner Victoria Sutherland (Rachelle Lefevre), and Laurent
               Da Revin (Edi Gathegi), who were responsible for a series of 'animal
              attacks' in town. Once the menacing trio became obsessed with Bella's
              intoxicating scent and began to hunt her down, Edward and the Cullens,
              including Alice (Ashley Greene) and her mate Jasper (Jackson Rathbone),
               unsuccessfully tried to protect her. She fled to Phoenix, where
               the insanely-predatory James tracked her, bit her arm, and infected
               her with vampire venom. Four of the Cullens retaliated, broke
               James' neck and burned his body, while Edward removed the venom
               from Bella's wrist to prevent her from becoming an immortal vampire.
               In the conclusion set back in Forks, soul-mates Bella and Edward
               attended the Forks HS prom, where Edward refused Bella's fervent
               desire to become like him. She wished he hadn't saved her, and
               instead had let the venom spread. Eavesdropping on them, Victoria
               was plotting to seek revenge for James' death. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008), </strong>96
              minutes, D: Woody Allen<br />
          Writer/director Woody Allen's romantic comedy told about the complicated and intimate
          relationships and entanglements experienced by two American women on
          a summer holiday in Barcelona, Spain. The two polar opposites were
          blonde Cristina (Scarlett Johanssen) - a liberated, sexually-adventurous
          female (romantically dreaming and looking for &quot;counter-intuitive
          love&quot;) who was also an aspiring, spontaneous photographer/filmmaker, and brunette
          Vicky (Rebecca Hall) - a practical and realistic traditionalist, and
          master's degree student. She was conducting research on the local Catalan
          culture, and was meanwhile engaged to marry predictable and dull New York businessman Doug (Chris
          Messina). Both Vicky and Cristina became emotionally and sexually involved - in a
          competitive love triangle - with charming lothario painter-artist Juan
          Antonio (Javier Bardem). Uncharacteristically, engaged fiancee
          Vicky was the first to make love with Juan Antonio after attending
          a Spanish guitar concert. Shortly afterwards, Cristina moved in
          with Juan Antonio and was regularly sleeping with him. Inserted
          into the mix was Juan Antonio's  hot-tempered,
          exotic ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz),  suicidal and unstable,
          who arrived in a stupor and  also moved in with Juan Antonio. Juan, Cristina,
          and Maria Elena were able to establish a <i>menage-a-trois</i> relationship for
          a short while, with Cristina providing their relationship's missing
          ingredient. Their time together also culminated in a one-time 'bi-sexual'
          kiss (and sexual encounter, off-screen) between Maria Elena and
          Cristina in a reddish-lighted darkroom. Meanwhile, Vicky was joined in
          Spain by  Doug and the two were married. However, Vicky still retained
             feelings for Juan Antonio, while at the same time, the threesome
             of Maria Elena, Cristina, and Juan Antonio had fallen apart. In
             the film's conclusion, the romantically-restless Vicky was being
             seduced by Juan Antonio when the volatile and tempermental Maria
             Elena burst in with a gun and shot Vicky in the hand. The film ended
             with the clueless Doug (with newly-wed wife Vicky) and still-unfulfilled
             and dissatisfied Cristina returning to the US.</font></p>        </td>

              Stanton <br />
            The eco-friendly, almost dialogue-free,
            Oscar-winning adventure and science-fiction story was the 9th
			<a href="pixaranimations.html"><i>Pixar/Disney</i></a> computer-animated
            film. The environmentally-conscious, comedy-animation was set in
            the year 2700. WALL&bull;E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) (voice of Ben
            Burtt) was the last lone garbage-compacting, sanitation robot on
            a post-apocalyptic, uninhabitable Earth, who  surprisingly had a
            liking for showtunes seen on VHS tape from the musical<i> Hello Dolly </i>!
            His single friend was a pet cockroach. For seven centuries, the industrious,
            ecological robot had been cleaning up Earth's harmful trash (and
            collecting treasures) after everyone had been evacuated on giant
            starliners to a giant orbiting mothership known as AXIOM, operated
            by a mega-corporation known as Buy N Large (BnL). Then one day,
            an unmanned probe-mission (known as Operation Recolonize) from AXIOM
            arrived, with a sleek, initially-cold, white-shelled (and egg-shaped), highly-advanced
            droid-robot on board - named EVE  (short
            for Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) (voice of Elissa Knight). EVE
            had been sent  to Earth to check on the progress of the clean-up
            and to locate plant life. In the odd-couple
            love story, WALL&bull;E instantly fell in love with EVE, who after
            being shown WALL&bull;E's latest discovery, a living seedling, 
			went into an unresponsive, deactivated
            stand-by mode to signal and obey her directive to notify AXIOM. EVE
            was retrieved - reclaimed and returned back to AXIOM several light
            years away, with WALL&bull;E hitching
            a ride on the outside of the probe. Inside the giant spaceship known
            as AXIOM, humans had turned into sedentary, corpulent, lazy, non-ambulatory
            figures who floated on personal hovercrafts, were fed liquid food
            through straws, and impersonally communicated with each other via
            video screens. Both WALL&bull;E and EVE were confronted by AXIOM's
            figurehead Captain McCrea (voice of Jeff Garlin), and his automated
            pilot known as AUTO (voice of Apple Computer's early robotic text-to-speech
            program MacInTalk). The two robots were able to cooperate together
            to counteract a secret &quot;no-return&quot; directive issued centuries earlier
            by BnL that prohibited a return to Earth to recolonize the planet.
            They were able to use a Holo-Detector to trigger a hyperjump back
            to Earth for themselves and AXIOM's other inhabitants, so that humanity
            could begin recolonization. In the tear-jerking conclusion, EVE was
            able to bring the crushed WALL&bull;E back
            to life with an electric kiss, after his memory had been reset and
            he appeared emotionless and seemingly-'dead.' Soon, the planet (with
            growing plant life) would be reinhabited by humans, and transformed
            by the efforts of the robots.</font></p>          </td>

              D: Darren Aronofsky<br />
          The title character of Darren Aronofsky's sports drama was a
          broken-down, has-been, formerly-famous 1980s headliner pro wrestler
          named Randy &quot;The Ram&quot; Robinson (56 year-old Mickey Rourke
          in a comeback role). His heyday in the ring was in the 1980s when he
          was so popular that he was sold as a popular action-figure and appeared
          in Nintendo video games, showing off his signature move -- a diving
          head-butt known as the &quot;Ram Jam.&quot; Now 20 years later 
		  with a healthy dose of pain-killers and
          steroids, he had returned to wrestling in an underground circuit on the weekends in small
          low-paying arenas, such as HS gyms or community sports arenas in New
          Jersey, to gain respect and integrity. During his possible comeback
          when he suffered a massive heart attack (and bypass operation), he
          was told to end his wrestling career and was forced to reluctantly
          retire. He began working full-time at his demeaning job at the counter
          of the local grocery-store deli. He was able to form
          a close bond with 43 year-old Pam/Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), a middle-aged,
          over-the-hill, tattooed exotic stripper and single mother, and persisted
          in asking her to settle down with him. She refused because of the circumstances
          under which they met, and because she had a 9 year-old son. He also
          struggled to emotionally and personally reconcile and reconnect with
          his estranged (and previously-abandoned) teenaged daughter Stephanie
          (Evan Rachel Wood) - with limited success. Exasperated about his life
          going nowhere, Randy angrily quit his job, and agreed to engage in
          a redemptive, high-profile rematch - sure-to-be his last and fatal
          fight in the ring against arch-rival &quot;The
            Ayatollah&quot; (Ernest Miller). He had faced the formidable opponent
          in a monumental match 20 years earlier. Before the match, Randy delivered
          an inspiring closing speech (&quot;I'm
        still standing here and I'm The Ram&quot;) to inspire his beloved fans,
        and then entered the deadly, self-destructive fight. The film concluded
         at the end of the match on a freeze-frame, as Randy lept from the top
        rope to deliver his signature &quot;Ram Jam&quot; move. </font></p>
