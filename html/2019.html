          <font size="2"><b>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019),</b> 109 minutes, D: Marielle Heller<br />
          Director Marielle Heller's biographical drama regarding Fred Rogers
          (aka the softspoken, cardigan-wearing Mr. Rogers) (Tom Hanks) was seen
          through the eyes of jaded, cynical, troubled and skeptical <i>Esquire</i> magazine
          writer and investigative journalist Lloyd Vogel  (Matthew Rhys) (based
          on real-life writer Tom Junod). In the course of their interactions
          for his article on cultural heroes for his editor   Ellen (Christine
          Lahti), Vogel found himself bonding with the appealing, kind, compassionate
          and truly nice Mr. Rogers, and realized he had been transformed by
          the unlikely friendship. The film opened with a typical episode of
          the show, as Mr. Rogers showed off a picture display board with five
          doors. Behind some of the doors were his friends (Lady Aberlin and
          King Friday from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, and the Speedy Delivery
          man Mr. McFeely), but the 4th one contained a picture of Lloyd - with
          a bloody nose and bruised face. He explained to the audience: &quot;Someone
          hurt my friend Lloyd, and not just on his face. He is having a hard
          time forgiving the person who hurt him,&quot; followed by an explanation
          of forgiveness. In 1998, Lloyd was under stress due to being a new
          father (with a newborn child) with his wife Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson).
          While attending the 3rd wedding of his sister Lorraine (Tammy Blanchard),
          Lloyd - who had a long-time hatred for his estranged father Jerry (Chris
          Cooper), engaged in a bloody fist-fight with him. Lloyd's anger stemmed
          from his animosity toward Jerry for cheating on and abandoning his
          mother Lila and their family while his mother was dying of cancer 20
          years earlier, and for having an affair with Dorothy (Wendy Makenna)
          - now Jerry's second wife. When his father suffered a heart-attack
          and was diagnosed as terminally-ill, Lloyd reluctantly helped to care
          for Jerry, and made peace with him before he died. In the concluding
          scenes, during the holidays, Mr. Rogers visited the extended Vogel
          family, took a picture of them together, and used the photo as the
          final picture in his picture board display, to explain how Lloyd had
          been happily reunited with his family. </font></p>      </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Bombshell (2019)</b>, 109 minutes, D: Jay Roach <br />
      Director Jay Roach's R-rated, quasi-documentary, biopic drama followed
          the challenging efforts of two female Fox News anchors at the cable
          TV network - the personification of &quot;bombshells&quot; - Gretchen Carlson,
          co-host of the morning show <i>Fox &amp; Friends, </i>and outspoken Megyn Kelly 
		  (Best Actress Oscar-nominated Charlize Theron)
          of <i>The Kelly File</i>. The two were juxtaposed to 
           the similar experiences of a third fictionalized composite character
          - an ambitious, naive,  blonde ing&eacute;nue  named Kayla Pospisil
          (Best Supporting Actress Oscar-nominated Margot Robbie) who worked on
          the staff of <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>. Each in their own way, they   
          confronted the issues of sexual harrassment, sexism and intimidation
          in their workplace. Their main target in 2016 was iron-fisted, lewd,
          and predatory Fox chairman Roger Ailes (John Lithgow, almost unrecognizable
          under makeup), who it was revealed - along with show host Bill O'Reilly
          (Kevin Dorff) - had sexually harassed or assaulted female employees
          at the network over many years. The bio-drama opened with Megyn Kelly co-moderating
          one of the Presidential election GOP debates involving Republican
          candidate Donald Trump in August of 2015. Kelly confonted the 
		  combative primary front-runner Trump with questions
          about his vicious and sexist name-calling, and caused an uproar throughout
          the company and country. Around the same time, Gretchen Carlson was
          removed as co-anchor of her show and demoted to a less popular show,
          allegedly after on-air comments about a federal ban on semi-automatic
          weapons. Meanwhile, Kayla had been ushered into Ailes' office where
          she was intimidated and pressured into raising her tight black dress
           to reveal her panty-line. Carlson met with lawyers to consider retaliating
          by <i>personally</i> suing Ailes, and claiming she had solid recorded evidence of her allegations,
          although Ailes denied any accusations against him. Carlson's lawsuit
          against her boss Ailes resulted in a long period of silence from Megyn
          Kelly, who finally after learning of Kayla's own harrassment, decided
          to also testify against Ailes. During her interview with investigators,
          she realized there were over 20 other witnesses against him. As a
          result, at the time of the Republican National Convention in 2016,
          Fox News' owner Rupert Murdoch (Malcolm McDowell) officially severed
          ties with Roger Ailes and ousted him, and Kayla quit her job at the
          network. In the official settlement terms, Gretchen Carlson received
          $20 million dollars and an apology, but was forced to sign a non-disclosure
          agreement. Other victims received $50 million, while Ailes and O'Reilly
          received $65 million in severance. </font></p></td>

          <font size="2"><b>Joker (2019),</b> 122 minutes, D:      Todd Phillips <br />
          This dark, nihilistic, R-rated, bleak  comic-book <i>Batman</i> movie
            thriller was unlike many others, and was regarded as highly-controversial
          for its shocking and visceral violence. It became the first
          R-rated movie in history to make $1 billion worldwide. This origin
          story set a higher  bar for the demented title character
          (with an unsettling iconic laugh) who earlier appeared in <i><a href="series-batman.html">Batman
              (1989)</a> </i>and in <i><a href="series-batman6.html">The
                Dark Knight (2008)</a></i>, played respectively by Jack Nicholson
                and Heath Ledger. This revised story borrowed many thematic elements
                and established connections with Martin Scorsese's two films
                <a href="taxi.html"><i>Taxi Driver (1976)</i></a> and <i>The
                King of Comedy (1982)</i>, both starring
                Robert De Niro (as Travis Bickle and obsessed comedian Rupert
                Pupkin). De Niro also appeared in this film as Johnny Carson-like
                talk show host Murray Franklin. The plot was
                set in the early 1980s in a crime-ridden, garbage and rat-infested
                Gotham City, where failed and mentally-unstable, erratic wanna-be
                stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck (Best Actor-winning Joaquin Phoenix)
                wore a mask for his day job as a professional party clown for
                a company known as Ha-Ha's. At odd times, he would burst into
                uncontrollable hysterical laughter due to a neurological condition.
                The impoverished Fleck lived in an apartment with his sickly
                and increasingly-senile mother Penny (Frances Conroy) and struggled
                with mental illness himself. He had recently been released from
                an institution and was heavily-medicated. After being bullied
                and ridiculed and losing his weekly therapy sessions and regular
                medications (seven in total), the tormented Fleck began a slow
                and mad descent as he transformed himself into his alter-ego
                - an infamous, murderous, psychopathic criminal mastermind known
                as Joker. The crucial turning point came after he killed three
                drunken, taunting males on the subway who worked at Wayne Investments
                (run by millionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), the father of
                young Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson)). Decades earlier in
                the 1950s, Arthur's mother Penny had worked as a housekeeper
                for the Wayne family, and claimed (falsely) that Arthur was Wayne's
                illegitimate son. However, her official file stated that she
                suffered from delusions, had a narcissistic personality disorder
                and had adopted Arthur and raised him with an abusive boyfriend.
                Fleck's killing spree intensified - the suffocation murder of
                his mother in a hospital, the shooting murder of his ex-colleague
                Randall (Glenn Fleshler), and the climactic brain-splattering
                murder of Murray Franklin on his TV show before a live audience.
                During subsequent street disturbances by a mob of angry, lower-class,
                clown-masked rioters, Thomas Wayne and his wife were murdered
                in an alleyway, although young Bruce was spared. The film concluded
                with the incarceration of Fleck in Arkham State Hospital, where
                he also presumably murdered his new therapist-social worker (April
                Grace).</font></p>        </td>

          A suspenseful, comedy and all-star Agatha Christie-inspired murder-mystery
          filled with ingenious deceptions and red herrings, investigated by
          renowned and debonair master Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig).
          The case regarded the mysterious circumstances surrounding the untimely
          death of wealthy and successful - but argumentative - crime novelist
          Harlan Thrombey - a family patriarch who had just turned 85. Everyone
          in the dysfunctional, eccentric and large Thrombey family (and its
          staff) became a suspect in the throat-slashing murder committed in
          his Massachusetts mansion, including Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis),
          Richard Drysdale (Don Johnson), Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon), Joni
          Thrombey (Toni Collette), and Hugh Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans). The
          key person in the mystery was Harlan's nurse/caretaker Marta Cabrera
          (Ana de Armas), who vomited every time she lied. She thought that she
          had accidentally overdosed Harlan with morphine, and as he died he
          told her to make up an alibi and then slit his own throat. When Harlan's
          will was read, everyone in the family was shocked that Marta was the
          sole beneficiary. Ultimately, final clues led to Ransom as the  
          calculating schemer behind Harlan's murder. </font></p>        </td>
