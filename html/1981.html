          <p><font size="2"><b>Arthur (1981), </b>117 minutes, D: Steve Gordon<br />
            Director Steve Gordon's romantic comedy 
            told about a drunken, idle-rich NY millionaire with a dilemma - his
            father insisted that he would only acquire his grandmother's inheritance
            by agreeing on an arranged marriage to a wealthy, upper-class lovestruck
          heiress. In the film's introduction,  alcoholic,
              spoiled millionaire playboy womanizer Arthur Bach (Dudley Moore)
                unknowingly picked up a hooker named Gloria (Anne De
                Salvo) on a street-corner. He answered
                her question about what he did for a living:
              &quot;I race cars. I play tennis, I fondle women, but I have weekends
          off and I am my own boss.&quot; The next morning, Arthur's faithful,
          wise, loyal, sarcastic, reserved and poised butler-valet Hobson (Oscar-winning
          John Gielgud) found them in bed together. Arthur's extortionist father
          Stanford Bach (Thomas Barbour) discussed with his son his worries about
          his son's reputation as a &quot;Millionaire Drunk Playboy.&quot; Arthur
          would be disowned or &quot;cut off...from the money&quot; if he didn't
          marry Susan Johnson (Jill Eikenberry) - the daughter of tycoon Burt
          Johnson (Stephen Elliott), his father's business acquaintance. However,
          Arthur stoutly refused but then conceded when his father threatened
          to withhold $750 million dollars. The wedding was scheduled for a month
          later. Then, Arthur saved lower-class shoplifter  Linda Marolla (Liza
          Minnelli), after he saw her stealing a necktie in a department store
          Men's Department, and she was accosted outside the store by Bergdorf
          Goodman's security guard Chester (Irving Metzman). Arthur covered for
          her by claiming that they were shopping together, and it was an oversight
          that he hadn't paid for the necktie. Over time, Arthur asked Linda
          for dinner dates and a visit to an arcade, and soon learned that she
          was an aspiring actress who worked in Queens as a diner waitress. Arthur
          began to fall in love with Linda. The drunken Arthur experienced a
          strained dinner with his lovestruck fiancee Susan Johnson, and failed
          to convince her to drop their engagement. Meanwhile, Linda was encouraged
                by Hobson to attend the upcoming engagement party if she was
                serious about him, due to his suspicions that Arthur had feelings
                for her. She crashed Arthur's engagement party held at his father's
          estate. Arthur temporarily postponed his wedding to care for
          his dying butler in the hospital. Although Arthur
                was sober for the last month of Hobson's life, he  went
          on a drinking binge following Hobson's death. The day of the wedding,
          the inebriated Arthur visited Linda working at the Queens diner to
          propose to her - and she accepted. After driving with Linda to the
          church, Arthur jilted Susan during preparations for the wedding ceremony,  causing
          her angry father Burt Johnson to attempt to stab him with a cheese
          knife. Wounded, Arthur called off the wedding before passing out. In
           the empty church where Linda was tending to Arthur's cuts, his wealthy
          grandmother Martha Bach (Geraldine Fitzgerald) overheard them declaring
          their love for each other. When she heard Arthur vow to sacrifice his
          lifestyle for the love of Linda, Martha stepped forward and wouldn't
          allow him to live a life of poverty - he accepted
          her offer of $750 million. As
          a result, in the finale, Arthur requested his black Rolls-Royce Silver
          Wraith limousine driver Bitterman (Ted Ross) to open the door for him
          and Linda before a drive through Central Park: (&quot;Bitterman! Do
          you want to double your salary?...Then, open that door!&quot;) - the
          last shot was of Arthur's personalized NY State license plate: ARTHUR. </font></p></td>

            and numbers-runner named Lou Pascal (Burt Lancaster at age 68) who
            lived in the gray, depressing Atlantic City boardwalk area. Threatened
            to be put out of business by the casinos, he was forced to be the
            kept man of a miserly and abusive aging beauty queen - a feisty,
            broken-down gangster's widow named Grace Pinza (Kate Reid). His only
            source of escape and pleasure was secretively watching his neighbor
            - a younger, cynical oyster-bar waitress named Sally Matthews (Susan
            Sarandon), who performed a sexy lemon-wash of herself at her window
            within his apartment's view. She aspired to become a blackjack dealer/croupier
            in one of the more glamorous resort casinos in Monte Carlo. Their
            lives were turned upside-down when Sally's deceitful, estranged husband
            Dave (Robert Joy) and her eight-months pregnant sister Chrissie (Hollis
            McLaren) showed up on Sally's doorstep to sell a stolen shipment
            of high-quality cocaine. Lou befriended all three and promised he
            could sell the drugs due to his connections with the underworld.
            When Dave was killed by the former owners of the drugs in the Philadelphia
            mob, Lou was able to keep the stash to himself as a financial windfall.
            He finally was able to play the role of his vain dreams as a big-time,
            respected, confident gangster, however illusory and dangerous, and
            was able to woo and show lavish generosity toward Sally as her self-appointed
            protector. After killing two gangland hoods to protect her, he admitted
            his life was exaggerated up until then: &quot;I never killed anybody
            in my life...But I did tonight&quot;, and he gleefully watched the
            report of the murders on the TV news: &quot;Hey, that's me!...This
            story is going to be big <em>all</em> over the country: 'Gangland
            slaying rips apart Atlantic City!'&quot; In the final sequence, Lou
            made a final promenade down the Boardwalk with Grace - with a panning
            shot up to a view of a wrecker's ball smashing into an apartment
        before the closing credits.</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Lawrence Kasdan<br />
              Director Kasdan's debut feature film was this modern-day, twisting
              film noirish tale of a deadly and obsessive love triangle, involving
              adultery, murder, and a deceptive <i>femme fatale</i>. It  was
              modeled after <a href="doub.html"><i>Double
              Indemnity (1944)</i></a> and <a href="post.html"><i>The
              Postman Always Rings Twice (1946)</i></a>.
            The highly-sexual tale was set in the heat of the fictional town
              Miranda Beach, FL, where tempting, smoky-voiced, sizzling and
              highly sensual <i>femme fatale</i> Matty
              Walker (Kathleen Turner) (with an elevated 'body heat' temperature)
              met simple-minded, small-town Florida attorney Ned Racine (William
              Hurt).  Ultimately, the predatory
              female set her sights on him to help plot the murder of her wealthy
              husband Edmund (Richard Crenna) - and make him her accomplice.
              During their initial encounters, their conversations were laced
              with lots of verbal foreplay and double-entendres. In an  erotic,
              steamy sex scene, Ned was about to leave Matty's mansion, but was
              enticed to reenter by an eager-looking Matty inside; he broke into
              her locked house through the lower porch's windowed doors with
              a garden lawn chair (to the sound of her wind chimes)
              to the awaiting, horny and receptive Matty as she laid back on
              the floor. Often, she inadvertently (but deliberately) kept referring
              to her husband's faults, her own unhappiness and how she'd wish
              her husband would die. She had mentioned that she
              had asked for a divorce, but a previous prenuptual agreement would
              leave her with little money. Fueled by his lust for both
              Matty's body and wealth, Ned conspired with her to plot the murder
              of her unsuspecting husband one night. There was a violent fight-to-the-death
              with Matty's husband during the botched murder in the hall of his
              opulent home.  The body was transported in Ned's car trunk to
            Edmund's abandoned beachfront hotel, and burned to the ground
            (with a timer device that was rigged by Racine's ex-client
              and arsonist Teddy Lewis (Mickey Rourke)). Although police first
            suspected that an arson accident had taken the life of Edmund, recent
            alterations to Edmund's will (co-signed by Ned, and witnessed by
            Matty's visiting HS girlfriend Mary Ann Simpson (Kim Zimmer)) made
            Ned the prime suspect. [Note: It was later revealed that Matty had
            forged Edmund's and Ned's signatures  on the documents, to inherit
            all of the estate via an invalid will.]  After Ned became suspicious,
            he forced Matty at gunpoint to enter her home's boathouse, that he
            suspected Matty had rigged with a similar explosive device. An explosion
            blew up the structure and presumably killed her. Ned - who was serving
            time in the Florida State Penitentiary for Matty's murder, finally
            realized that he had been duped. Matty had planted the body of Mary
            Ann Simpson (who slightly resembled her) in the boathouse before
            the explosion, and escaped with her own life. Matty had assumed the
            name and life of her friend - and presumably, the real &quot;Matty&quot;
            learned of the deception and threatened blackmail (and payoffs),
            but was then killed, and her body was stashed in the boathouse. This
            was confirmed for Ned in the startling conclusion when he saw Matty
            Tyler's picture in a 1968 high school yearbook, with her name displayed
            as &quot;Mary Ann Simpson&quot; (with the nickname &quot;The
            Vamp&quot; and her ambition: &quot;To be rich and live in an exotic
            land&quot;). </font></p>          </td>

  Uli Edel's bleak and notorious coming-of-age film was based on an autobiographical
        1979 memoir sub-titled <i>Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo (We Children from
        Bahnhof Zoo)</i>. The story, set in late 1970s West Berlin, was about
        a real-life drug-addicted young teen prostitute named Christiane F. (Natja
        Brunckhorst). The cool tone of the film was reinforced
          by a David Bowie soundtrack (and midway through a live Bowie concert
        in a nightclub). The film-makers made extensive use of the actual locations
        mentioned in the book, including her home district of Gropiusstadt
        - a working class neighborhood or borough in southeastern Berlin that
        consisted mainly of social housing (drab, high-rise concrete apartments).
        She became hooked on heroin by her 14th birthday and began turning
        tricks and getting high at Bahnhof Zoo, West Berlin's then-largest
        train and subway station. Other locales included the city's modern &quot;Sound&quot; Diskothek
          where <i><a href="nightoflivingdead.html">Night of the Living Dead (1968)</a></i> 
		  was projected to teens, Berlin's
          seedy public toilets, and the roof of the Europa-Center (with a revolving

              German director Wolfgang Petersen's sympathetic and realistic,
              expensively-made anti-war film was faithfully adapted from the
              1973 autobiographical book by war correspondent Lothar-Guenther
              Buchheim. The epic followed the heroic efforts of war-weary German
              U-boat captain (Jurgen Prochnow), known as Der Alte (&quot;the
              Old Man&quot;), and his desperate crew during WWII as they patrolled
              the North Atlantic and Mediterranean. They were confined and crowded
              in the claustrophobic, grimy, cramped insides of their U-96 undersea
              vessel, while being attacked from above. The harrowing and tense
              film included scenes of depth charge attacks, rivets popping during
              a deep dive maneuver, hull breaches that let in water, terror during
              an attempt to raise the damaged ship, and threats of asphyxiation
          and starvation.</font></p></td>

              Writer/director Sam Raimi's debut film was the ultimate &quot;cabin
              in the woods&quot; story about demonic forces in the woods (not
              really reanimated dead zombies). The hyper-kinetic film had very
              little dialogue, plot and character development, but incredible
              POV tracking shots. It was followed by two sequels: <i><a href="series-evildead2.html">Evil
              Dead II (1987)</a>, </i>and<i> <a href="series-evildead3.html">Army
              of Darkness (1992)</a>. </i>In the story, Five Michigan State University
              students in their 20s, who were spending a weekend retreat in a
              rented, remote cabin in the Michigan mountains, inadvertently unleashed
              (or raised from the dead) dormant, demonic evil spirits from the
              ominous surrounding forest. With the discovery of a tape recording
              of potent incantations left by a professor who once lived there,
              and an accidental recitation of spells from a mysterious ancient
              Sumerian <i>Book of the Dead</i> known as the <i>Necronomicon</i> -
              they called up murderous spirits. After being raped by tree branches
              in a horrific scene, Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) was transformed into
              a demon zombie (known as a Deadite or Shemp) with a greyish white
              face and superhuman strength. The next to be possessed was Ash
              William's (B movie icon Bruce Campbell) sister Shelly (Sarah York).
              Scotty (Hal Delrich) died from massive injuries inflicted by trees
              when he tried to walk out of the area, while the next victim was
              Ash's girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker). Cheryl (who had escaped from
              the cellar) continued to attack Ash as well as a zombified Scotty,
              whose eyeballs had to be gouged out. Only Ash escaped being violently
          possessed by 'evil dead' forces by film's end.</font></p></td>

                  Miller <br />
            Writer/director George Miller's imaginative, post-apocalyptic action
            sci-fi (western) film was about a burned-out, ex-cop named &quot;Mad&quot; Max
            (Mel Gibson in a star-making role) (his last name from the first
            film in the trilogy, Rockatansky, was never uttered).   The film's
            stark, naturalistic depiction of a post-apocalyptic future has been
            copied ever since by many other imitators. The entire film had the
            same formula as <a href="shan.html"><i>Shane
            (1953)</i></a>, <em>The Magnificent Seven (1960)</em> or a Sergio
            Leone 'spaghetti western', with Gibson providing the Clint Eastwood &quot;Man
            With No Name&quot; legendary
            hero - or anti-hero role. This sequel film, superior to the original
            film -  an even darker revenge film <em>Mad
            Max (1979)</em>, was followed by a <em>nuclear</em> post-apocalyptic
            sequel, <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)</em>, memorably featuring
          a co-starring role by rock star Tina Turner. In this comic book-styled
            B-film, the lone cop road warrior Mad Max (Rockatanksy) (Mel Gibson)
            stood as a lone figure on a highway amidst visions of a post-apocalyptic
            violent world. He wandered the barren, lawless highways of an Australian
            outback  wasteland in his black super-charged
            Interceptor along with his Australian cattle dog. Living only to
            survive while dealing with anarchic crazies and violent road gangs,
            his main mission in life was to acquire enough precious petrol to
            keep nomadic. A flashback from the previous original film was presented
          with black-and-white newsreel footage - showing 
          the murder of Max's wife and child by a biker gang. He eventually partnered
          or allied himself with a looney, comical Gyrocopter pilot,
            Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), to help a small, besieged band
          of decent-living refugees or survivors (in an oil-producing colony),
          led by settler leader Papagallo (Mike Preston), who were defending
            a small fuel depot at the refinery. Max, the Gyro Captain, and the
            settlers were being relentlessly assaulted by a crazed, marauding
          wasteland warlord, the evil, hockey mask-wearing Humungus (Kjell Nilsson)
          and his horde of followers. Humungus knew that
          the colonists' objective was to locate a large semi-tractor rig to
          haul their fuel-filled oil tanker from the compound, in an escape 2,000
          miles to &quot;Paradise&quot; on the northern coast. Max carried through
          on his promise to deliver a big-rig to haul the tanker, in exchange
          for gas. During his mission, Max was pursued by a punk crazy warrior
          - red Mohawk-haired Wez (Vernon Wells) and other Marauders, but was
          able to return to the compound with the Mack truck, with the Gyro Captain's
          aid. After stating that his work was done, Max deserted the colony
          and drove away from the compound in his Interceptor, but was soon overtaken
          by Wez (and gang members), and was seriously injured (and his car was
          destroyed). Back in the compound, the semi-recovered, still-wounded
          Max stumbled out of the infirmary and with a stunning change of heart
          (as a reluctant hero), announced to everyone that he would drive the
          Mack Truck (pulling the fuel tanker). At the same time, the other settlers
          would flee the compound (rigged with explosives) in the opposite direction
          in a convoy (including the school bus and other vehicles). The film
          concluded with a dazzling climax - with non-stop car action and amazing
          stuntwork. Max was viciously attacked at breakneck speed by a convoy
          of bizarre vehicles, souped-up cars and motorcycles, and the savage
          band of punkish desert vandals. At the end of the chase sequence, Max
          turned his Mack tanker truck around, and it crashed head-on into Lord
          Humungus' car coming from the other direction -- also killing Wez,
          who was clinging to the front fender of the tanker and was smashed
          between the two vehicles. It was then revealed, in the film's surprise
          twist,  that Max's 40-foot tanker truck - allegedly filled with refined
          petroleum fuel (&quot;precious juice&quot;) during the breakout
          drive - had been a decoy as a diversionary tactic. His  fuel tanker
          was filled with reddish sand, while the gasoline had secretly been
          hidden in large drums stored in the school bus (and possibly other
          vehicles), allowing the small band of settlers to ultimately escape.
          The epilogue was conveyed by the same voice-over from the film's opening
          (from the Feral Kid (Emil Minty)). He described how the Gyro Captain
          (who succeeded Pappagallo) went North with the settlers as their new
          leader, and the Feral Kid (the grown-up Narrator) with his bladed boomerang
          eventually became the Chief of the Great Northern Tribe when the Gyro
          Captain died. </font></p>          </td>

              Rydell
              <br />
        Director Mark Rydell's warm-hearted Best Picture nominated family drama
        was based on screenwriter Ernest Thompson's off-Broadway stage play -
        honored by Henry Fonda's first Best Actor Oscar win. In the cliched but
        well-acted story, adoring wife Ethel Thayer (Katharine Hepburn in the fourth Oscar-winning role of her
              career)  was excited with her cantankerous, gruff, &quot;old poop&quot; 80-year-old
              husband Norman, Jr. (76 year old Henry Fonda in an Oscar-winning
              role and in his last film) as they drove up at the start of presumably
              their last annual summer trip to the location of their Golden Pond
        cabin, their New England lakeside vacation home in Maine. Ethel joyously
              announced that the loons were welcoming them home. The very vulnerable
              Norman was continually reminded that he was growing old, suffering
        from various ailments, and losing his memory.  Norman became distressed
              and fearful at his failing physical and mental health (senility
              and death) when he momentarily lost his way in the woods and became
        disoriented and in a panic while picking strawberries. They were surprised
              by the visit of Norman's estranged and sole divorced daughter Chelsea
              Thayer Wayne (real life daughter Jane Fonda) with
              her new fiancee, 45-year-old divorced dentist Bill Ray (Dabney
              Coleman), and his 13-year old teenaged son Billy Ray (Doug McKeon)
              from Los Angeles - they were on their way to Europe. They would
              help celebrate Norman's 80th birthday. Throughout Chelsea's visit,
              Chelsea complained to Ethel about her father's condescending, overbearing, and unapproachable
        nature when she was with him. Ethel was critical of Chelsea, basically
              taking sides with Norman and not as sympathetic as she might be,
              and thought that Chelsea was equally cynical and had a chip on
        her shoulder. During  summer fishing adventures (Billy was left
            behind when Chelsea and Bill went on to Europe for a few weeks),
            Billy (with Norman) attempted to catch a legendary 10-pound rainbow
            trout named 'Walter' (Norman called it &quot;a crafty old son of
            a bitch!&quot;) - the lake's largest fish, and the two developed
            an affinity and camaraderie for each other during their crusade to
        catch the enormous fish. While fishing for 'Walter' one evening in the
        dangerous and rocky Purgatory Cove, Billy (at the wheel of the Thayer
            speedboat) crashed into a rock instead of reversing. In the near-fatal
            accident, Norman was catapulted into the water and received a gash
            on his head, and a worried Ethel was able to locate and
            rescue both them. When Chelsea returned from a month in Europe (Bill
            returned to LA), she confided to Ethel that she was now married.
            Chelsea predicted that her father would be unproud and unhappy
          about her marriage  to Bill, although Norman seemed to have
        established a connection with Billy. However, in a heart-tugging  scene
            at the dock, teary-eyed Chelsea awkwardly reconciled with her father
            Norman, and requested that they begin a new more reasonable father-daughter
        relationship. The afternoon scene culminated with Chelsea
            eagerly showing off by doing &quot;a real goddamned back-flip&quot; from
        the diving board for an appreciative Norman. When Chelsea was departing,
            Norman presented her with one of his old, second place diving medals
            from his days at Princeton - a symbol of their new relationship as
            she called him &quot;Dad&quot; for the first time. In the film's final scene, the last
        day for the Thayers at Golden Pond, when packing and loading boxes, Norman
        collapsed due to angina. After Ethel gave him his life-saving
        nitroclycerin medication, they discussed the reality of death. The film's
        final lines of dialogue came as they walked to the edge of the lake and
        stood there before leaving, when Norman now noticed and heard the loons
        on the lake possibly saying goodbye - he compared themselves to the last
        two remaining loons. </font></p></td>

              D: Andrzej Zulawski<br />
          Director Andrzej Zulawski's experimental
          and avant-garde work was an unusual hybrid - a surrealistic and bizarre
          occult horror film and a domestic marital drama with doppelgangers.
          Much of the film was deliberately shot in the early 1980s during
          the tense Cold War, right along the Berlin Wall in the Kreuzberg
          section of West Berlin. It was a perfect allegorical reminder of
          the time when the entrapping Wall, close to the evil Communist world,
          still split and scarred the land and its people. The symbolically-told
          story was about tormented young French femme Anna (Isabelle Adjani)
          engaged in a self-destructive, disintegrating marriage to husband
          Mark (Sam Neill). The alienated rival spouses shared an apartment
          in East Berlin within view of the Wall and were slowly driving each
          other apart. Finding herself in a tortuous love triangle, Anna's
          tortured id created a supernatural, wormy-tentacled, lizardy, monstrous
          creature. She kept it as her 'secret lover' for sexual fulfillment
          in a second sparse and rundown Kreuzberg apartment. In the film's
          most famous sequence, Anna experienced a five-minute hysterically-screaming,
          miscarriage-birthing flashback sequence in a deserted, echoing Berlin
          U-Bahn subway station tunnel in which she writhed, convulsed and
        tossed her bag of groceries against the wall. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Steven Spielberg<br />
            Director Spielberg's thrilling, entertaining action-adventure film
            paid homage to 1930's cliff-hanging adventure serials/films at Saturday
            matinees. It has become regarded as one of the greatest action films
          ever made - and led to a trilogy of sequels:  <a href="series-indianajones2.html"><em>Indiana
          Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)</em></a>, <a href="series-indianajones3.html"><em>Indiana
          Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)</em></a>, and <a href="series-indianajones4.html"><em>Indiana
          Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)</em></a>. The main
          protagonist hero was mid-1936, pre-WWII comic-bookish, globe-trotting,
          bull-whip toting adventurer/archaeologist-treasure hunter Dr. Indiana
          &quot;Indy&quot; Jones (Harrison Ford) who was searching for rare antiquities.
          In the white-knuckle opening sequence, the bull-whip wielding Indy
          was exploring in a South American (Peruvian) rainforest, where he entered
          a booby-trapped jungle cave to retrieve a fierce-looking but
          beautiful golden Fertility Idol artifact from an altar. When he snatched
          it, he set off a chain reaction of destruction (including
           poisonous blow-gun darts and arrows, and a threatening,
          giant rolling boulder). The idol was stolen by Indy's nemesis, a
          French archaeologist who was working for the Nazis, Dr.
          Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), while Indy made a getaway from a  tribe
          of Hovito cannibals to escape on an awaiting airplane.  At Marshall
          College where multi-talented Archaeology Professor Jones taught, he
          was enlisted by two US Army Intelligence officers: Colonel
          Musgrove (Don Fellows) and Major Eaton (William Hootkins), to
          locate the gold-encrusted Biblical Ark of the Covenant (holding the
          10 Commandments) before the evil agents of Hitler used its powers to
          win the war. The Nazis had been discovered digging in excavations on
          the desert outskirts of Cairo, Egypt in the ancient lost city of Tanis
          (at the Well of Souls) - the possible resting place of the Ark of the
          Covenant. In a race with the Nazis, Indy flew to Nepal, hoping to be reunited
          with his old Egyptologist mentor Professor Abner Ravenwood, who had
          acquired the head-piece (a gold medallion) to the staff of Ra that
          would help to pinpoint the exact location of the Ark. In
           Nepal, Indy became reacquainted with his ex-girlfriend Marion Ravenwood
          (Karen Allen) from 10 years earlier - Ravenwood's tough, hard-drinking,
          spunky and feisty gambling daughter, who managed a Nepalese saloon.
          She reportedly possessed (from her dead father) the valuable Egyptian
          headpiece artifact; it was revealed to be on a necklace around her neck. She expressed her
          hard feelings and anger over their former love affair by unleashing
          a solid right to Indy's jaw: (&quot;I learned to hate you in the last
          ten years... I was a child. I was in love. It was wrong and you knew
          it!&quot;). That night, four Nazi agents led by sadistic-looking, treacherous
          Nazi Gestapo Major Toht (Ronald Lacey) burst in, engaged in a shoot-out,
          and burnt down her bar while looking for the headpiece. After escaping
          the first of many life-threatening situations (with the medallion),
          the self-effacing hero and Marion partnered together. The two traveled
          to Egypt where Marion was kidnapped, and presumed dead after a truck
          explosion. It was a race against time to make the correct calculations
          about the Ark's location, since the Nazis, led by Belloq, had already
          found the map room at Tanis three days earlier. However, without the
          headpiece, it would be very easy to dig in the wrong place. Indy entered
          the map room, marked the Ark's exact location (in an ancient tomb at
          the Well of Souls), and began digging closeby to where the Nazis were
          excavating. In the historic tomb, Indy found himself surrounded by
          venomous snakes, before he was able to locate the Ark and bring it
          (enclosed in a wooden box) to the surface with ropes. To his surprise,
          he was greeted by Belloq and the Nazis, who absconded with the Ark; Marion (who
          was alive after all) was pushed into the chamber to join Indy as the
          pharaoh's tomb was sealed. The two found their way out of the chamber,
          and Indy was able to prevent the Ark from leaving on a plane bound
          for Berlin and Hitler. After the plane exploded, 
            Belloq ordered the Ark loaded aboard a truck to Cairo (where it would
          then be flown to Berlin). Atop a magnificent white Arabian stallion, Indy
          excitingly pursued after the canvas-topped Nazi truck caravan carrying
          the Ark. He was able to successfully make his way onto the truck and into the cab, and then drove
          the truck to a different hiding place.  The Ark was placed in the cargo
          hold of a tramp steamer, where both an exhausted Marion and wounded
          Jones were  passengers. The Nazis overtook the steamer via submarine,
           repossessed the Ark, and took it to a mysterious
           island in the middle of the Aegean Sea, in preparation for an elaborate
          Nazi ceremony that involved opening the Ark. In the climactic finale,
           the captured Indy and Marion were tied back-to-back to a pole-stake,
          and watched from a few hundred feet away, although Indy warned: (&quot;Don't
          look at it. Shut your eyes, Marion, and don't look at it, no matter
          what happens&quot;). God's fiery vengeance was visited upon the Nazis after Belloq opened the
          Ark's cover. Fire consumed him and his body exploded, while piercing firebolts and
          shafts of fire zapped the rest of the Nazis through the heart. Marion
          and Indy were the only two survivors. In the film's epilogue,  the
          Ark (packed inside a wooden crate) was delivered to Washington, DC
          and was filed away in a massive government warehouse where there were
          hundreds of similar cartons.</font></p>

            Director Warren Beatty's sprawling and overly-ambitious political
                biopic was an ill-fated, sweeping, and tumultuous love story
                between American journalist-activist John &quot;Jack&quot; Reed
            (Warren Beatty, the producer/director/co-writer), a naive yet charming
            radical revolutionary, and strong-willed aspiring writer-photographer
             Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton with a Best Actress nomination). 
			She abandoned her dull dentist husband and middle-class, provincial
            life and followed the idealistic Reed and other leftist bohemians
            and free-thinking members of the intelligentsia to Greenwich Village
            and Provincetown. As a feminist and advocate of free love, she had
            an intense romance with Reed (involving many spats, partings and
            reuniting make-ups, due to their frequent separations). The assertive
            Louise became frustrated and self-angry at being underappreciated
            and marginal to Reed's heroics and fame, and she made efforts to
            strike out and establish her own identity. In a side-plot, Louise
            engaged in a  brief, but tumultuous summer affair with
            playwright Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson) - in the love triangle,
            he served as a rival for Louise's affection. O'Neill glibly provided
            a 'devil's advocate' counterpoint to the romantically-idealistic
            viewpoints of revolutionaries Louise and Reed.  She 
            secretly married Reed, and then sparks flew when they worked together
            in Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution and Reed wrote <i>Ten Days
            That Shook the World</i>,
            but soured once their lives as writer-colleagues ended. She was loyally
            propelled back into the arms of Reed at the Moscow train-station
            - the film's finale, but he was soon on his death-bed. </font></p>        </td>

            119 minutes, D: John Badham<br />
          </font><font size="2">This provocative
            film asked the question: Does a patient have the right to choose
            to die? 32 year-old gifted sculptor and art teacher Ken Harrison
            (Richard Dreyfuss) suffered horrible injuries following a car crash
            - a severed spinal cord. After six months, it was determined that
            he was paraplegic and paralyzed from the neck down. On a life-support
            machine in ICU with cameras monitoring him, he came to the conclusion
            that he wanted to die, if he could only get the hospital to discharge
            him. He told his dedicated girlfriend/dancer Pat (Janet Eilber)
            that he was terminating their relationship - and that he wanted
            her to regard him as dead (&quot;I don't want to go on living like this&quot;).
            Nonetheless, he kept an acerbic sense of humor, but mostly with
            one-liners about his 'vegetable' condition and his sexual impotence.
            The strict and stubborn Chief of Medicine Dr. Michael Emerson (John
            Cassavetes) was opposed to Harrison's wish to die, judged him to
            be too clinically depressed (and therefore incompetent) to make
            a logical decision, and injected him with Valium (against his wishes)
            to keep him comfortable and less anxious. Another physician Dr.
            Clare Scott (Christine Lahti) eventually came to be sympathetic
            and agree with Harrison that he had a right to decide his own fate.
            He was also supported by free-spirited, black orderly John (Thomas
            Carter) with a love of reggae music, and pretty young novice nurse
            Mary Jo Sadler (Kaki Hunter). The embittered Harrison hired personal
            injury lawyer Carter Hill (Bob Balaban) to represent him in a right-to-die
            case. He wanted a final ruling on whether he could legally be forced
            (or not) to stay in the hospital for treatment. The judge in the
            case, which was held in a hospital office, was Judge Wyler (Kenneth
            McMillan). The hospital countered Harrison's
              wishes by threatening to order him involuntarily committed (under
              the Mental Hygiene Law) to remain in the hospital. Harrison's lawyer
              argued that he was being held without his consent, by bringing
              a pre-emptive action against the hospital with a writ of habeas
              corpus. The hospital's psychiatrist Dr. Jacobs (George Wyner) agreed
              with Dr. Emerson's adversarial position. Harrison defended his
              right to die in an eloquent speech, by claiming that he was completely
