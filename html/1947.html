            95 minutes, D: Irving Reis<br />
            Director Irving Weis' romantic 'screwball' comedy and farce was noted
            for its Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay (Sidney Sheldon).
            In the 'battle of the sexes' story, three main characters became
            entangled: a charming bachelor-playboy artist, an impressionable
            teenaged girl, and a female judge. As the film opened in a municipal
            courtroom, Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Nugent
            (Cary Grant) - a womanizing, handsome, and well-dressed  bachelor-playboy
            - had been arrested after a brawl in The Vampire Club - an LA nightclub
            (instigated by two women fighting over his attentions). Although
            it was his third such charge, he was released by presiding, serious-minded,
            single Judge Margaret Turner (Myrna Loy), who disregarded the contrary
            advice of her Asst. DA Tommy Chamberlain (Rudy Vallee), her part-time
            prissy and stuffy yet hopeful boyfriend. Afterwards, Nugent appeared
            as a guest art lecturer to Sunset HS students in a school assembly,
            where 17 year-old teenager Susan Turner (a grown-up Shirley Temple
            in a more adult role), who happened to be the ward and younger sister
              of Judge Turner, was in the audience with her HS boyfriend Jerry
            White (Johnny Sands). After the assembly, Susan interviewed Nugent
              for her HS newspaper and immediately became love-smitten and  infatuated
            with him - she imagined him as her 'knight in shining armor.' Susan
            also brazenly decided to sneak out of her house and visit Nugent
            in his apartment to model a dress for him; Nugent was confronted
            there and accused of being a trouble-making seductor by both the
            Judge and ADA Tommy Chamberlain; Nugent retaliated and slugged Chamberlain
            in the nose. Another similar court case ensued, when Nugent was charged with assault and again
              called before Judge Turner; after speaking with the court psychiatrist
              Matt Beemish (Ray Collins), Susan's and the Judge's uncle, Nugent
            was encouraged to accept an unusual compromised sentence -   he was
            ordered to date Susan. The Judge's objective was to 'cure' or end
            Susan's obsessive romantic interest. At a basketball game, a malt shop,
            and then a high school picnic, Nugent was awkwardly paired with Susan.
            In the latter, Nugent competed in an obstacle course race - and with
            the assistance of Susan bribing his competitors to lose, Nugent won
            the race. Meanwhile, Judge Turner was beginning to fall in love with
            Nugent; she invited him to dinner and dancing at the Tick Tock Club,
            where the elegantly-dressed couple were constantly interrupted. The
            evening soon spun out of control into another uncomfortable situation
            (when Susan began acting as a wronged female and threatened to break
            up with Nugent). Exasperated, Judge Turner reprimanded Nugent and
            then stormed off. Susan was soon convinced to return to her appropriately-aged
            boyfriend Jerry. In the final scene at the airport, the reluctant
              Judge Turner and Nugent were set up by  her cupid-playing Uncle
              Matt Beemish to board the same TWA airplane - and spend
            vacation time together. To cement their relationship, she initiated
              the familiar bobby-soxer word-play game  beginning with: &quot;You
              remind me of a man.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

              Henry Koster<br />
              RKO's perennial Christmas holiday fantasy classic was a sentimental
              and heart-warming favorite. Its  screenplay by Robert Sherwood
               and Leonardo Bercovici was based on author-novelist Robert Nathan's
              1928 novella. It was a Best Picture Oscar nominee and was beautifully
              photographed by Gregg Toland. The romantic comedy was poorly remade
              as <i>The  Preacher's Wife (1996)</i> by
              director Penny Marshall, with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston.
              The film opened by introducing a handsome,
              charming, and suave guardian angel sent from heaven named Dudley
              (Cary Grant). He became involved in the lives of a married couple: harried
              Episcopalian Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) and his lovely
              but often sad wife Julia Brougham (Loretta Young). Henry had become
              obsessed with building and funding  a new cathedral, and was having
              difficulty raising money and receiving support from the wealthy
              and elderly Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), the chair of the cathedral
              committee. Due to his preoccupations with the cathedral, the Bishop
              was clearly producing strains in his marriage. The very helpful 
              and debonair Dudley was not there to assist with the cathedral's
              fund-raising, but to show Henry what he had been neglecting in
              life -- the poor and needy, the boys' choir, his parishioners and
              most noticeably his wife who had the incredible gift, according
              to Dudley of &quot;making heaven here on Earth.&quot; When the
			   Bishop prayed for &quot;guidance&quot;
              and divine help, Dudley showed up in his study. As time passed,
              Henry became increasingly annoyed with Dudley's intrusiveness,
              attention to Julia, and he was jealous of Julia's growing infatuation
              and attraction for him. All the while, Dudley kept trying to remind
               the Bishop about all his greater priorities in his life. On
               Christmas Eve, Dudley volunteered to rewrite Henry's Christmas
               sermon, and dictated while the typewriter took down his words.
               When Henry finally publically announced the importance of Julia
               in his life to Dudley (&quot;Julia
            means more to me than my life, I'm not going to lose her&quot;),
            the angel promptly announced his departure. Dudley was relieved
                    to realize that Henry had finally straightened out his priorities
                    - and his prayer for &quot;guidance&quot; (rather than for
                    a cathedral!) had been answered. As
                    he was summoned back to heaven after his mission was accomplished,
                    the angel told
            Henry that he and everyone else would have no memory of his visit
            or existence: (&quot;When I'm gone,
            you will never know that an angel visited your house&quot;). 
			At St. Timothy's Church, the Bishop delivered Dudley's sermon on Christmas
            Eve at midnight, while Julia beamed at him from the pews. From
            the street outside under a light falling snow, Dudley listened
            to the poignant and touching words, satisfied that his work was
            complete as he turned and slowly walked away - bringing the film
            to a heartfelt close.</font></p>          </td>

              The provocative, engrossing and richly-Technicolored spiritual
              and erotic melodrama (with Oscar-winning cinematography by Jack
              Cardiff) from the UK was based on the 1939 novel by Rumer Godden.
              It acquired  two wins for its two Oscar nominations:
              Best Color Cinematography (Jack Cardiff), and Best Color Art Direction-Set
              Decoration. The psychological drama's theme was the inevitable
              struggle between the spirit (or sacred realm) and the profane (or
              flesh). The dazzling, visual cinematographic
              masterpiece told about a convent (with a village  school
              and hospital infirmary-dispensary) run by a group of five  
              British Anglican nuns (from the Order of St. Mary) in the far remote
              Himalayans. There was breath-taking imagery of an exotic sultan's
              palace (once a bordello for concubines known as the House of Women,
              decorated with erotic wall paintings), with a bell
              tower on the edge of a 9,000 ft. precipice. The facility was donated
              to the convent by the local ruler General
              Todo Rai of Mopu (the &quot;Old General&quot;) (Esmond Knight).
              The nuns were led by devout, serene and pious Sister Superior Clodagh
              (Deborah Kerr) who was privately being haunted and tormented by
              memories of a broken romance in Ireland with a past lover Con (Shaun
              Noble) who deserted her. Amidst the eerie atmosphere were violent
              and continuous winds, a half-mad elderly female caretaker Angu
              Ayah (May Hallatt), a 6 year-old servant boy named Joseph Anthony
              (Eddie Whaley Jr.) who served as a translator, mysterious drum-beats,
              a meditating Hindu holy man, and strange native rituals. The nuns
              were also aided with help and advice by a government intermediary
              - the sexy yet cynical and very macho British agent Mr. Dean (David
              Farrar), the Old General's or Prince's agent. In a sideplot,
            the 'Young General' or young Prince (Sabu), vain heir to the throne
            of the princely state, arrived at the convent to be educated. After
             the presence of a young village girl was also suggested by the Prince
            -  a sexually-intriguing, lower-caste, 17 year-old native dancing
              girl Kanchi (Jean Simmons) arrived, and the young Prince became
              infatuated with her. A few major issues arose after the accidental
              death of a child given castor oil (that frightened the villagers
              away from the school or dispensary), and the young Prince's 'elopement'
              with Kanchi. The most disruptive problem was brought about by the
              unstable, troubled, sexually-conflicted, high-strung Anglican nun
            - the mentally insane Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron). She was driven
            mad by  jealousy (toward the authoritative Sister
            Clodagh), and her repressed and starved sexuality consumed her  
            due to her lust for Mr. Dean. In the unnerving, climactic conclusion
            one evening, Sister Ruth renounced her nunhood vows of celibacy and
            decided not to renew her vows. She adorned herself in a bright-red
            forbidden dress, and applied matching red lipstick (symbolizing her
            break with the nunnery). She trekked down the mountain to Mr. Dean's
            house where she attempted to seduce him. When he curtly spurned and
            rejected her, she returned to the convent and sought to attack her
            rival Sister Clodagh, who was at the edge of the cliff at the bell-tower
            ringing the prayer bell. The cathartic scene ended when intended
            victim Sister Clodagh was saved from death as she grabbed hold of
            the bell-tower rope after being pushed toward the precipice by the
            jealous and vengeful Sister Ruth, who lost her balance and fell to
            her death. In the film's denouement, the nuns packed up to leave
            after they had failed in their spiritual mission. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Body and Soul (1947), </b>104 minutes, D: Robert
              Rossen<br />
              Director Robert Rossen's film was one of the best, most compelling,
              starkly-realistic boxing sports  (and film-noirish) dramas ever
              produced before a rash of imitators and parodies. It featured a
              powerful screenplay by Abraham Polonsky, with impressive fight
              sequences (winning an Oscar for Best Film Editing) shot with roller-skating
              cameramen to enhance the realism. It was uninspiringly remade as <i>Body
              and Soul (1981)</i>,
              with a script updated to include African-American and Latino boxers,
              and notable female nudity. In this definitive film that also served
              as a cautionary morality tale (told in flashback), John Garfield
              (in his best film role) starred as tough, naive, dim-witted but
              decent Charley Davis from a poor Jewish family in the slums of
              the Lower East Side, who chose boxing as a means to escape his
              life of poverty. The pugilist successfully worked his way to the
              top, the middleweight championship, by both fair and unethical
              means (his association with crooked racketeers and fight promoters)
              to the disapproval of his mother Anna (Anne Revere), his free-spirited
              Greenwich Village artist-girlfriend Peg Born (Lilli Palmer), and
              his loyal lifetime friend Shorty Polaski (Joseph Pevney). He blindly
              believed he could become independent once he made it as the champ,
              but then was disillusioned when his threatening, unethical, corrupt
              hoodish handler Roberts (Lloyd Gough) demanded 50% of the take
              to help him win the championship. Charley made more wrong decisions,
              resulting in Shorty's accidental death, a broken engagement with
              his girlfriend, reckless gambling, and a harmful relationship with
              gold-digging nightclub vamp Alice (Hazel Brooks). He ended up indebted
              - and was ordered to take part in a fixed fight (he was told to
              fight all fifteen rounds and lose the fight by a decision) - something
              that would cause him to also lose his soul and self-respect. At
              the last minute in the sensational final sequence, he rebelled
              against his operators, knocked out his challenging newcomer opponent
              Jack Marlowe (Artie Dorrell), returned to Peg, and rejected Roberts
              (&quot;Get yourself a new boy. I retire&quot;). When Roberts threatened
              Charley as he left the ring, Charley mocked him with an ironically-quipped
              line used earlier in the film: &quot;What
              are you gonna do, kill me? Everybody dies.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              88 minutes, D: Elia Kazan </font><br />
              <font size="2">This semi-documentary crime film was based upon
              the true story of the 1924 unsolved murder of an Episcopal priest
              in Connecticut. The elderly,
              beloved and kindly priest Father George Lambert (Wryley Birch)
              of Bridgeport, CT was murdered (by gunshot) during his regular
              evening walk at a street-corner by an unidentified killer. Police
              Chief Harold F. 'Robbie' Robinson (Lee J. Cobb) faced tremendous
              political pressure to quickly find the suspect. There were seven
              witnesses to the shooting, but the killer's face wasn't conclusively
              seen, and there were no other clues. <i>The
              Morning Record</i> (and its ace political reporter Dave Woods (Sam
              Levene)) stirred up trouble by blaming the current administration
              for being soft on crime. Out-of-town WWII veteran and unemployed
              drifter John Waldron (Arthur Kennedy) was soon targeted as the
              suspected murderer (he was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio), although
              he vehemently denied being involved. Forensics evidence showed
              that the bullet came from his gun. He was exhaustively questioned
              by the police chief and lead detective Lieutenant White (Karl Malden)
              for two days, and gave in by signing a confession - under duress.
              State's District Attorney Henry Harvey (Dana Andrews), a potential
              candidate for governor, was assigned to try and prove Waldron's
          innocence - obvious, the suspect was a victim of prejudgment.</font><font size="2">During
          the court hearing, Harvey destroyed the prosecution's case and exonerated
          Waldron. He reenacted the crime seven times - proving that none of
          the unreliable eyewitnesses could have seen the killer from where they
          were positioned on the street. He also demonstrated that the intense
          grilling from police was unfairly brutal and that the confession was
          coerced. He also submitted five expert ballistics reports that disproved
          the bullet came from Waldron's gun. In a dramatic Russian Roulette-styled
              challenge, Harvey dared Waldron's loaded gun to be fired into the
              back of his own head - the gun wouldn't fire (revealing that it
              had a broken malfunctioning pin and couldn't be fired). Waldron
              was freed, and although the case was reopened, the real killer
              was never caught. [In a scene much earlier in the film, it was
              surmised that Lambert's killer might have been his mentally-unstable
        assistant pastor.]</font></p>        </td>

              <font size="2">Director Jules Dassin's powerful, violent, claustrophobic,
                  film-noirish crime-prison drama (with a musical score by Miklos
                  Rozsa) told about the grim, overcrowded and dehumanizing
                  conditions of life in the Westgate Penitentiary under the rule
                  of the brutal chief guard - sadistic Captain Munsey (Hume Cronyn).
                  The prison's craven Warden A.J. Barnes (Roman Bohnen) and frustrated,
                  alcoholic Doctor Walters (Art Smith) were both weak-willed
                  and overshadowed by the harsh and fear-inducing, fascist treatment
                  inflicted upon the prisoners in the isolated facility. [Note:
                  With a flashback technique, a number of the inmates described
                  the circumstances that brought them to prison - almost all
                  involved a duplicitous, double-crossing or scheming female.]
                  The dictatorial chief guard was abetted in his reign of terror
                  by stoolie inmates who spied on other prisoners and reported
                  to him. One spy named Wilson (James O'Rear) was discovered
                  and forced by angry convicts with flame-throwers into a huge
                  steel punch press in the prison's workshop-factory. In Cell
                  R 17, single-minded prisoner Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) had
                  been incarcerated for the theft of money to support his wheelchair-bound,
                  cancer-stricken wife Ruth (Ann Blyth). Collins became
                  the leader of a movement, along with gambler Spencer (John
                  Hoyt), embezzler Tom Lister (Whit Bissell) and Robert &quot;Soldier&quot;
                  Becker (Howard Duff) to begin a plan of escape. After Lister
                  committed suicide due to a devastating mental lie told to him
                  by Munsey about his wife Cora (Ella Raines), Collins and other
                  convicts were punished by being put on a prison drain pipe
                  work detail. They began to execute their complex plan. Part
                  of the strategy was to have top mobster-prisoner Gallagher
                  (Charles Bickford) create a diversionary 'riot' in the prison
                  yard, while the escape would occur out of the prison's drain-pipe.
                  To learn more about their plan just before the prison break,
                  the suspicious Munsey beat, interrogated and tortured one inmate
                  Louie Miller (Sam Levene), and also forced a confession from
                  'Freshman' Stack (Jeff Corey). During the actual prison escape
                  out of the mine and through the outer prison gates, informant
                  'Freshman' who was secured to the front of a mining car, was
                  the first to be shot and killed. A gun battle erupted in the
                  yard, where Joe was lethally-wounded. Unheeded, he climbed
                  to the top of the central guard tower, in flames from fire-bombs,
                  to engage in a brutal physical fight against Munsey. After
                  hurling him to his death below, Joe collapsed dead.
                  Getaway truck driver Gallagher was also killed and an arriving
                  contingent of guards tear-gassed the remainder of the convicts
                  to capture and control them. The film concluded with Dr. Walters'
                  bewildered, existential words about the hopelessness of the
                  situation - delivered behind bars: &quot;Collins and Munsey are
                  dead. And the others. All those others. Why do they do it?
                  They never get away with it. Alcatraz, Atlanta, Leavenworth.
                  It's been tried in a hundred ways from as many places - and
                  always fails, but they keep trying. Why do they do it?....Nobody
                  escapes. Nobody ever really escapes.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

        </font><br />
        <font size="2">RKO's and Edward Dmytryk's noirish message drama (filmed
        mostly at night with low-key lighting), a taut, intelligent and exciting
        melodrama and murder mystery, was a rare Hollywood social issue film
        - a landmark film and one of the first to indict anti-Semitism, prejudice
        and bigotry, along with this year's Best Picture-winning <i>Gentleman's
        Agreement (1947)</i>.
        The blunt, honest and engrossing box-office hit was based on Richard
        Brooks' 1945 novel <i>The
        Brick Foxhole</i>, although in the book, the victim was homosexual. 
         It has the notable distinction of being the first B-picture to receive
        a Best Picture nomination. The catalyst of the film was an incident (told
        in various flashbacks) that occurred one drunken evening, when a group
        of recently-discharged soldiers on leave were partying in a Washington
        DC hotel nightclub with Miss Lewis (Marlo Dwyer) and her Jewish boyfriend,
        war hero civilian Joseph &quot;Sammy&quot; Samuels (Sam Levene). After
        some of them went to the man's apartment, there appeared to have been
        an argument - and later, Miss Lewis found Sammy's body. Subsequently,
        an investigation into the mysterious murder was conducted by a
        lead civilian cop, crusading district attorney Capt. Finlay (Robert Young),
        with help from laconic military cop Sgt. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum).
        When questioned as a suspect, ex-cop and GI veteran-soldier &quot;Monty&quot; Montgomery
        (Robert Ryan)  claimed
        that he and another friend, civilian redneck Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie),
        were with ex-WPA artist and Corp. Arthur &quot;Mitch&quot; Mitchell (George
        Cooper) in Samuels' apartment. The night's
        comings and goings  were relayed by the suspects, in flashback,
        to the officers. In an abrupt move to throw off the police and silence
        one of the potential witnesses against him, &quot;Monty&quot; beat and
        hanged Bowers with a necktie, leaving him presumed dead. The evidence
        seemed to be pointing, however, towards Mitch who was suffering from
        post-war depression and drunkenness. Although he could not provide a
        convincing alibi - Keeley firmly believed in Mitch's innocence. It was
        soon revealed, under interrogation, that the
        bigoted and unhinged &quot;Monty,&quot; who openly despised Jews, had
        the proper motive to murder the Jewish boyfriend with his bare hands
        - but his hate crime needed to be proven. After
        piecing together the puzzling events, Finlay set a trap for the violent,
        crazed and unstable &quot;Monty,&quot; who was also suspected of  murdering
        Bowers, with the help of Monty's other friend Leroy (William Phipps).
        Leroy told &quot;Monty&quot; that Bowers was alive and wanted to meet
        with him at a specific address (deliberately incorrect). When &quot;Monty&quot; arrived
        at the right address for best buddy Floyd,  
        he revealed his obvious guilt.  &quot;Monty&quot; fled from police and
        was shot dead by Finlay on the street as the film concluded.</font></p>        </td>

              Daves<br />
              Director Delmar Daves adapted David Goodis' 1946 novel of the same
              name for this film. The noir was similar in plot to <i>The Fugitive
              (1993)</i> and <i>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</i>. It was another
              drama teaming Bogart and Bacall (their third of four films together,
              following <i>To
              Have and Have Not (1944)</i> and <i>The Big Sleep (1946)</i>),
              although one of their lesser ones. Unique in that Bogart's complete
              face was not viewed for over an hour (obscured by shadows or bandages),
              when he finally removed facial bandages. The gimmicky, full-of-unlikely
              coincidences film was shot in an unorthodox way - from his subjective
              POV (looking through his eyes). In this thriller-noir,
              con Vincent Parry (Humphrey Bogart) - a lifer in prison for murdering
              his wife Gert, escaped from San Quentin by hiding in a barrel.
              He conveniently joined up with attractive and wealthy artist Irene
              Jansen (Lauren Bacall), sympathetic to his plight to prove his
              innocence, because her recently-executed father was also falsely
              accused for a similar crime. Her evil friend Madge Rapf's (Agnes
              Moorehead) testimony had helped to frame Parry in the first place.
              To deter attention and mask his identity, Parry underwent plastic
              surgery on his face from Walter Coley (Houseley Stevenson), and
              changed his name to Alan Linell. Then with faithful Irene's help,
              he attempted to clear his name and prove that he didn't kill his
              wife. He was
               doggedly pursued by small-time, blackmailing hood Baker (Clifton
              Young), who argued and gun-played with Parry at Fort Point and
              fell to his death from a cliff. To make matters worse, Parry was
              also framed for the death of his close friend George Fellsinger
              (Rory Mallinson). In the conclusion, it was revealed that Madge
              had killed both Parry's wife and George. When Parry confronted
              Madge to force her to sign a confession, she struggled with him,
               stumbled and fell  from a window. In the unusual
              happy ending (for a film noir), Parry fled with Irene to Paita,
              Peru where they danced in an oceanside nightclub to the song  <i>Too
              Marvelous for Words</i>. </font></p>        </td>

              Cukor<br />
              Cukor's noirish psycho-melodrama, with an excellent script of sharp
              dialogue by the husband-wife team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin,
              also had an Oscar-winning score by Miklos Rosza. It told about
              famous Broadway matinee-idol actor Anthony John (Oscar-winning
              Ronald Colman in a career-topping role) whose stage roles were
              taking over his obsessed, off-stage personal life. The veteran
              actor knew that there would be disastrous consequences during his
              performance of different roles - for example, he had divorced his  ex-wife
              Brita (Signe Hasso) two years earlier while acting in a Chekov
              play. He feared  what would happen in real life if he took the
              role of Shakespeare's jealous Moor named Othello, with Brita as
              his leading lady Desdemona. It was a torturous role for him, as
              every night on stage, he was forced to strangle his wife due to
              jealousy. During these pressurized performances, his jealousies
              overtook him. When he feared that Brita was
              in love with somebody else, their publicist Bill Friend (Edmond
              O'Brien), he was compelled to act as Othello. He strangled
              his lover-mistress Pat Kroll (Shelley Winters in a star-making
              role), a pathetically-lonely, mid-20s slutty waitress he had met
              in an Italian restaurant. The
              curtain-falling conclusion of <i>Othello</i> blurred
            the boundary between art and life when the delirious actor stabbed
        himself to death on-stage.</font></p>        </td>

              Not to be confused with the 1940 film of the same name starring
              Martha Raye. It was based on the Finnish play <i>Juurakon Hulda</i> by
              Hella Wuolijoki that was purchased by David O. Selznick, potentially
              for Ingrid Bergman. It was later created as a TV
              series in 1963 starring Inger Stevens. In this delightful and smart
              romantic comedy (with a Cinderella theme), Loretta Young (in an
              Oscar-winning signature role) starred as Katrin Holstrom, the Swedish
              daughter of stalwart Minnesota farmer (Harry Shannon). In the big
              city of Washington DC where she was planning to attend nursing
              school, lecherous painter-acquaintance Adolph Petree (Rhys Williams)
              swindled her out of her savings. With nowhere to turn, she became

              Morley (Joseph Cotten) and his powerful politico mother Agatha
              (Ethel Barrymore). Learning how the political game was played by
              her association with him and crusty butler Joseph Clancey (Charles
              Bickford), the feisty, independent-minded, and common-sensed Katrin
              decided to improve politics. She ran as a Reform candidate in an
              opposition party against the corrupt political machine (and its
              replacement candidate for a deceased officeholder) - it was very
              similar to the conclusion of many Frank Capra films. As a result,
              although there was a smear campaign to discredit her, she won the
              election and went to Congress with Glenn.</font></p>          </td>

              D: Elia Kazan<br />
              The compelling and controversial film (at the time) was adapted
              by Moss Hart from Laura Z. Hobson's best-selling novel (originally
              serialized in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>), although now somewhat dated
              in its impact. It was the top grossing picture for 20th Century
              Fox in 1948, and one of the first Hollywood films to confront the
              problem of anti-Semitism, bigotry and religious prejudice. This
              morality tale was one of a number of films that explored serious
              social issues in the 1940s. The film's title referred to the &quot;gentleman's
              agreement&quot; practice of Gentiles (non-Jews) discriminating
              against Jews. Kazan's startling, Best Picture-winning sober drama
              was a powerful, sentimental and melodramatic story about a non-Jewish
              magazine reporter-journalist Philip Schuyler Green (Gregory Peck),
              a recently-widowed single father. He had writer's block about
              a new assignment - an expose-article on the subject of anti-Semitism
              for his liberal <i>Smith Weekly</i> magazine publisher John Minify
              (Albert Dekker) - until he decided to go undercover and pose as
              a Jew (with the name Phil Greenberg) to have a first-hand experience.
              Predictably, he encountered prejudice, scorn and hatred. His son
              Tommy (Dean Stockwell) was bullied in school (and called names
              such as &quot;dirty Jew and stinking kike&quot;), and his complacent,
              close-minded socialite girlfriend Kathy Lucy (Dorothy McGuire),
              a divorced schoolteacher and niece of <i>Smith Weekly's</i> editor,
              was snubbed by her Darien, Connecticut friends. Green experienced
              religious abuse and bias when rejected for a hotel room. The magazine's
              sharp-tongued fashion editor, a counterpoint to Green, was Anne
              Dettrey (Oscar-winning Celeste Holm), and his childhood Jewish
              friend was Dave Goldman (John Garfield). Deeply-rooted prejudice
              and underlying anti-Semitism were revealed in his friends, colleagues,
              and casual acquaintances.</font></p></td>

              104 minutes, D: Joseph L. Mankiewicz<br />
              Joseph Mankiewicz' charming, turn-of-the-century romantic fantasy,
              was based on the 1945 R.A. Dick (Josephine Leslie) novel with a
              script by Philip Dunne. It later became a TV series. It told about
              a young and independent, strong-willed but lonely widow Lucy Muir
              (Gene Tierney) with a young daughter Anna (Natalie Wood) in Victorian
              England. She discovered a salty, hot-tempered naval sea captain
              Daniel Gregg (Rex Harrison) as a ghostly presence in her English
              seaside Gull Cottage, in the town of Whitecliff-by-the-Sea. Windows
              and doors opened on their own, candles blew out and there was disembodied
              laughter. The source of the spookiness was undoubtedly
               Gull
              Cottage's former owner who was haunting the bedroom and thoughts
              of Lucy in his non-flesh-and-blood form. The film's tagline asked:
              &quot;Is Lucy Muir's love really a ghost, or is it a man of flesh and
              blood she yearns for?&quot; She refused to be scared by the ghostly
              denizen of the spiritual world, however, and struck up a strong
               bond with some romance. When she acquired debts, he helped her
               to be a &quot;ghostwriter&quot; - composing a successful, best-selling novel
               of autobiographical memoirs about his own life, titled <i>Blood
               and Swash</i>, that she transcribed from his dictations. In the
               meantime, she was charmed by smooth-talking cad Miles Fairley
               (George Sanders), an author of children's books. Gregg's jealousy
               was sparked, and she became uncertain of the captain's motivations
               when he warned her about the adulterous suitor. The ghostly sea
               captain decided to bid
               good-bye to Lucy while she slept. He told her that she must find
               her own way in life - and that she was only dreaming of a sea-captain
               haunting the house. In the transcendent, tearjerking final scene
               many years later, white-haired, elderly widow Lucy died in her
               British seaside cottage's armchair when Captain Gregg reappeared
               and greeted her with outstretched hands: &quot;And
            now, you'll never be tired again, come Lucia, come my dear.&quot; Rejuvenated
            and young again, she walked off, hand-in-hand with him downstairs
        and through the front door into the afterlife with him.</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Kiss of Death (1947)</b>, 99 minutes, D: Henry Hathaway<br />
          Director Hathaway's  definitive crime noir with a methodically-paced
            script was written by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer. To convey authenticity,
              all of the film's scenes were shot in the state of NY - the actual
              locale of the story. In the  initial sequence, an unidentified
              female voice-over began to narrate a flashback. To support his
              family, unemployed crook and ex-con Nick Bianco (Victor Mature) &quot;went
              Christmas shopping&quot; on Christmas Eve with two other thugs
              in the Chrysler Building's exclusive 24th-floor jewelry store.
              The heist was botched when their escape was delayed by a descending
              elevator, and Bianco (the only one in the group of four thugs)
              was shot in the leg and arrested. The Ass't District Attorney Louis
              D'Angelo (Brian Donlevy) met with Bianco and offered him leniency
              if he &quot;squealed&quot;
              on his three accomplices. Bianco - who had a wife named Maria and
              two infant daughters (Consetta or &quot;Connie&quot;
                  and Rosario or &quot;Rosie&quot;), stubbornly refused to be
                  a &quot;stoolie.&quot; His shady shyster crime lawyer Earl &quot;Early&quot; Howser
                  (Taylor Holmes) promised to take care of him, but he failed
                  and Bianco  was sentenced to 20 years at Sing Sing Prison
                  (in Ossining, NY). Three years into Bianco's sentence, he learned
                  that his depressed, heavy-drinking wife had committed suicide,
                  and his two children were sent to an orphanage. He decided
                  to reconnect with D'Angelo and offered to now rat on the other
                  criminals, in order to receive early parole and to see his
                  children. The main target that the DA wanted to nab was sociopathic,
                  maniacal, cold-blooded killer Tommy Udo (Oscar-nominated Richard
                  Widmark in his screen debut). Bianco squealed on his three
                  accomplices, including the unseen driver Pete Rizzo. Then,
                  to cover for Bianco's betrayal, it was implied that Rizzo was
                  the one who had talked about a previous crime - the Thompson
                  Fur heist. Howser got in touch with the homicidal Tommy Udo
                  to get rid of Rizzo. In the film's most frightening sequence,
                  Udo entered the apartment of elderly, crippled Mrs. Rizzo (Mildred
                  Dunnock) (the mother of alleged informant Pete Rizzo), and
                  to seek revenge, he terrorized her by ripping out a lamp's
                  electrical cord and tying her to her wheelchair; as she protested,
                  he then proceeded to roll her out of her apartment to the top
                  of a long flight of stairs - and chuckled to himself as he
                  shoved her forward to her death. In the meantime, Bianco became
                  romantically involved with ex-housekeeper Nettie Cavallo (Coleen
                  Gray), who had loved him from afar for many years. They were
                  married and he regained custody of his two children, and then
                  he attempted to settle down as a family man in Queens. However,
                  D'Angelo
                  called Bianco for another favor - to force him to testify against
                   Udo in a trial for a different previous crime (that he had
                  bragged about to Bianco), and to their surprise, Udo was acquitted.
                  Bianco knew that the police couldn't adequately protect him
                  or his family from Udo's revenge, so he sent his family away
                  temporarily to the country for their safety, and then decided
                  to proceed on his own, without accepting D'Angelo's offer of
                  help (&quot;I'm
          through trusting you, the police or anybody but me. There's only one
          way to get Udo, and that's my way&quot;). In the film's exciting conclusion,
          Bianco confronted Udo and his gang members after midnight at Luigi's
          Restaurant in Harlem, in order to entrap Udo into using a gun. He alerted
          the nearby police precinct to his plan, and they promptly arrived on
          the scene (and shot and apprehended Udo), but in the aftermath, Bianco
          was severely injured with multiple gunshot wounds. However, he had
          survived the ordeal and was able to find peace with his wife and children
          once again. </font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Lady in the Lake (1947),</b> 105 minutes, D: Robert Montgomery </font><br />
          <font size="2">Robert Montgomery both directed (his directorial debut
              film) and starred in this Christmas-themed classic crime noir,
              adapted from Raymond Chandler's 1944 novel of the same name by
              Chandler himself. It featured a unique gimmick - an experimental
              and revolutionary subjective (or first-person) camera technique,
              meaning that the main protagonist was off-camera for most of the
        film, although sometimes viewed in mirrors. The
        mystery plot was very convoluted and twisting - difficult to follow at
        times. It basically involved a search by writer/detective Phillip Marlowe
        (Robert Montgomery) for a missing, promiscuous wife who had allegedly
        run off to Mexico with a handsome, gigolo boyfriend named Chris Lavery
        (Dick Simmons). The quest for the missing woman (&quot;Chrystal Kingsby&quot;)
        was instigated by a gold-digging <i>femme fatale</i> Adrienne Fromsett
        (Audrey Totter) who had ulterior motives to marry Chrystal's rich husband
        - her own boss Derace Kingsby (Leon Ames). The detective's search discovered
        that the wife might be responsible for the murder of a mysterious &quot;lady
        in the lake&quot; found near a summer cabin near Little Fawn Lake owned
        by Kingsby. The victim was initially identified as 'Muriel Chess' - the
        wife of Kingsby's cabin caretaker Bill Chess, and he was charged with
        the crime. A key discovery was that Muriel had another name - Mildred
        Havelend. Soon after, Lavery's suspicious landlord 'Mrs. Falbrook' (Jayne
        Meadows) was seen just before Lavery's shower murder. It was up to Marlowe
        to fit the pieces together and discover who was behind the murders (involving
        switched identities, a deadly love triangle and a double-cross) - and
        to discover the deadly motives of 'Mrs. Falbrook' (with her many aliases).
        The key to the whole plot was the identity of 'landlady' Mrs. Fallbrook.
        She was actually the supposedly-drowned Muriel Chess/Mildred Havelend
        who had married Bill Chess, Kingsby's caretaker, and then assumed the
        married name of Muriel Chess, in order to hide her real identity as Mildred
        Havelend from a &quot;tough cop&quot; named Lieut. DeGarmot (Lloyd Nolan).
        It was more than likely that Chrystal was the corpse in the
        lake, not Muriel. In the film's conclusion, Marlowe figured out 
          that Mildred/Muriel and Chrystal had jealously fought over handsome
            male Chris Lavery. This rivalry was clearly
            Mildred's motive to kill Chrystal and make it look like Muriel was
            the dead body in the lake, so she could run away with Lavery. After
            Chrystal's drowning/murder, Mildred fled and ran away to El Paso
            - and Lavery &quot;was the only one who knew the real identity of
            the lady in the lake&quot; - the reason that Mildred returned and
            also eliminated him and killed him in the shower. A sub-plot involved
            Lieut. DeGarmot who had partnered with Mildred to help her to hide
            and cover up the murder of a doctor's wife named Florence Almore.
            After his help and the case closed, Mildred fled from him. She &quot;double-crossed&quot; the
        love-struck DeGarmot by abandoning him and changing her name to Muriel
        Chess (after marrying Bill Chess, Kingsby's caretaker) with the intent
        to hide and get away from the &quot;tough cop.&quot; In the final scene,
        DeGarmot caught up with Mildred and described
      his feelings of double-cross and betrayal by her. Marlowe
          attempted to dissuade DeGarmot: (&quot;The Almore case won't come up.
          They'll convict her for Chrystal's murder or Lavery's. You'll be clear&quot;),
          but DeGarmot's intention was to kill both Marlowe and the deceitful
          Mildred with her gun and stage it to look like she and Marlowe had
          shot each other, in order to frame them for the other murders. She
        begged for her life, but to no avail. DeGarmot shot her multiple times
          - point-blank - in view of Marlowe. The crooked cop DeGarmot was then
          gunned down by Captain Kane (Tom Tully) and another officer through
          a window, before he could kill Marlowe. At the
          end of the film after the case was solved, Adrienne and Marlowe left
          NYC together to begin a serious romance.</font></p>

                  34th Street (1947)</a>, </b>96 minutes,
              D: George Seaton<br />
            This popular, perennial Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday
            favorite that was adapted from Valentine Davies' original story,
            was a dramatic comedy-fantasy about the commercialization of Santa
            Claus and Christmas itself. The sentimental and appealing Frank Capra-esque
            morality fantasy tale (similar to <em><a href="meet.html">Meet
            John Doe (1941)</a></em>) was about the struggle between faith and
            doubting cynicism, as well as between the holiday spirit of generosity
            and materialistic commercialism. When a hired Macy's Santa Claus
            participating in NYC's Thanksgiving Day parade (up 5th Ave.) was
            discovered to be intoxicated by a white-whiskered, kindly old man
            calling himself Kris Kringle (Best Supporting Actor-winning Edmund
            Gwenn), Kringle was offered an emergency replacement job  by special-events
            parade director-organizer and divorced, workaholic single mother
            Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara). The new, grandfatherly jolly fellow
            from the North Pole proved to be a smash hit following the parade
            and was appointed as the store's new Saint Nick. Some questions were
            raised when he endorsed and sent customers to other rival, competing
            department stores, such as Gimbels, when Macy's didn't have the desired
            merchandise. And when toy department boss Mr. Julian Shellhammer
            (Philip Tonge) urged Kringle to memorize and push a list of overstocked
            toys on undecided children, the 'Santa' expressed his disgust at
            X-mas commercialization. The store's incompetent psychologist Mr.
            Sawyer (Porter Hall) questioned Kringle's 'insane' fantasy that he
            actually was Santa. Doris' doubting, equally cynical, wide-eyed,
            and delightfully-precocious young second grade daughter Susan Walker
            (Natalie Wood) also thought Kringle was only a fairy-tale - she did
            not believe in childhood dreams. When Doris urged Kringle to tell
            Susan that Santa didn't exist, Kringle's insisted that he really
            was Saint Nick. Susan didn't believe that the actual, warm-hearted,
            white-haired Kris Kringle was real, and pulled his beard to test
            him. Kris Kringle also entered into a concerned conversation with
            Doris about the loss of the real meaning
            of Christmas: (&quot;For the past 50 years or so, I've been getting more and more worried
            about Christmas. Seems we're all so busy trying to beat the other
            fellow in making things go faster, and look shinier, and cost less
            that Christmas and I are sort of getting lost in the shuffle&quot;).
            The most touching moment in the film occurred when children were
            in line to see and speak to Santa. Susan watched from the side and
            was impressed as Kringle kind-heartedly and reassuringly sang to
            a frightened, non-English-speaking refugee and Dutch immigrant girl/orphan
            (Ida McGuire) in her native language. He performed a duet with her
            of a traditional Dutch carole. Eventually, Doris made the shocking
            discovery that Santa's address, revealed in his work application,
            was the Brooks' Memorial Home for the Aged in Great Neck, Long Island,
            NY, where he was a nursing home resident. The resident physician
            Dr. Pierce (James Seay) claimed that 'Santa' was delusional but not
            dangerous. However, psychiatrists from Bellevue Hospital threatened
            to have him committed and put away in a mental institution, although
            Kringle's twinkly-eyed earnestness and wholesomeness eventually removed
            the doubts of even the skeptical Doris and Susan. Before Kringle
            was committed to Bellevue, Doris' handsome bachelor lawyer-friend
            Fred Gailey (John Payne) - her love interest and next-door neighbor,
            had convinced presiding NY State Supreme Court Judge Henry Harper
            (Gene Lockhart) to hold a hearing to determine Kringle's mental health
            (sanity or lunacy). A memorable court hearing battle that extended
            through Christmas Eve, pitted two lawyers against each other; Fred
            Gailey took the defense to prove that Kris was truly Santa while
             the state's DA Thomas Mara (Jerome Cowan) was out to prove that
            Kringle was insane. During the stirring finale, Susan wrote a letter
            to Kris Kringle to cheer him up while in court for his insanity hearing
            (with her mother's added postscript: &quot;I
            believe in you, too&quot;). Gailey  needed to prove his case that it was wrong to vilify Santa Claus,
            and at the same time acceptable to have faith in the red-suited character
            and believe in the power of imagination (and the Christmas spirit).
            On his side was the idea that it would cause a backlash to rule against
            Kris Kringle, and against the possible existence of Santa Claus.
            In a showstopping strategic move during the courtroom scene, Gaily
            asked questions of the District Attorney's young son Tommy, Jr. (Bobby
            Hyatt) on the witness stand:  &quot;Do you believe in Santa Claus?&quot; and &quot;Why are you so
            sure there's a Santa Claus?&quot; - and the boy answered affirmatively
            that his dad had told him so. It was a winning maneuver proving that
            Santa Claus actually existed. In a climactic display of US mail evidence, Gailey also cleverly produced
              21 bags and stacks of thousands of post office letters addressed
              to Santa Claus from the 'dead letter' section of the Post Office.
              His argument was that the US government agency's recognition of
              these letters was &quot;positive proof&quot; of Santa Claus' existence. The
            judge agreed and  dismissed the case, and Kringle was released. The
            concluding scene featured Susan in a car with Gailey and Doris (now
            in love) on Christmas Day, as they drove up to the house of her dreams
            - a house (with a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign). It was a special present
            that she had hoped would come from Santa. She repeatedly tried
            to keep persuading herself to have faith (and believe in Santa): &quot;I
            believe&quot; - and then expressed her overwhelming joy  when
            Kris Kringle's gift came true. Now a firm believer in
            Kris Kringle (or Santa), she told Fred and Doris after wildly running
            through the house: &quot;But this is my house, Mommy, the one I asked
            Mr. Kringle for. It is! It is! I know it is!&quot; Gailey kissed
            Doris and proposed to her in their future home, while Susan helped
            to persuade them to think about purchasing the house - but after
            seeing Kris' cane standing beside the fireplace, Fred  expressed
            his doubts about brilliantly winning the case: (&quot;Maybe
          I didn't do such a wonderful thing after all&quot;). </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Monsieur Verdoux (1947)</strong>, 124 minutes,
              D: Charles Chaplin<br />
        Chaplin's ahead-of-its-time Bluebeard crime drama and black comedy, based
        upon the notorious French killer named Henri Landru, was subtitled: &quot;A
        Comedy of Murders.&quot; The subversive and satirical film, taken from an
        idea by Orson Welles, was considered controversial and unsettling in
        its post-war time period, and became a box-office failure - although
        has now attained the status of a cult-classic. It was Chaplin's first
        film in seven years (after <i><a href="greatdictator.html">The
        Great Dictator (1940)</a></i>), and
        very different from his popular &quot;Little Tramp&quot; character. The film told
        about a straight-laced Parisian bank clerk-teller named Henri Verdoux
        (Charlie Chaplin), who had an invalid, wheelchair-bound crippled wife
        Mona (Mady Correll) and young son Peter (Allison Roddan) to support.
        Around the time of the Great Depression after he lost his job of 35 years,
         the suave, dapper, cynical, middle-aged and unemployed Verdoux became
        a notorious serial killer murderer and bigamist whose preferred modus
        operandi was to marry middle-aged wealthy women, murder them, and appropriate
        their money. He used several aliases (e.g., Varnay, Bonheur, and Floray,
        etc.) in order to marry almost a dozen women simultaneously. The comedic
        highlight of the film was that one of the would-be victims, widowed Annabella
        Bonheur (scene-stealing, big-mouthed comedienne Martha Raye) kept winning
        lotteries, and also proved challenging to eliminate for Verdoux. His
        murder attempts continually failed due to her fortunate good luck. When
        the stock market crashed and the banks failed, Verdoux found that he
        was broke. He turned himself into the police after being suspected by
        a victim's relative. He was put on trial - and before being convicted,
        he delivered a courtroom speech about how society was hypocritical (&quot;As
        a mass murderer, I'm an amateur by comparison&quot;). He argued that
        world wars, dictators, and mass genocidal killings were sanctioned by
        society and other countries, but his own crime of killing only a few
        out of necessity (in order to survive) brought about a sentence of death
        by guillotine.</font></p>        </td>

            Goulding<br />
          Director Edmund Goulding's dark, bleak, fatalistic and very disturbing
          crime-noir was basically the story of the rise and precipitous fall
          of a con-man - an overly-ambitious, cynical and fake mentalist/spirtualist
          or clairvoyant. The repulsive tale of decadence, doom and deception
          was based upon William Lindsay Gresham&rsquo;s 1946 novel of the same
            name, with a screenplay by Jules Furthman. [Note: Director Guillermo
          Del Toro's remake <i>Nightmare Alley (2021)</i> starred Bradley Cooper
          and Cate Blanchett in the two lead roles.] Handsome roustabout drifter
          Stanton &quot;Stan&quot; Carlisle (Tyrone Power)  had just joined
            a carnival as one of its hustlers. He was fascinated by a performance
            of The Geek  (George Beranger) - one of the carnival's biggest draws,
            presented by the main carnival barker/owner Hoatley (James Flavin):
            Stan was tutored    in the tricks of the trade by Miracle Woman
            Zeena Krumbein (Joan Blondell), a fortune-teller whose assistant-husband
            Pete Krumbein (Ian Keith) was a spent, over-the-hill drunkard, who
            helped her to deceive audiences. Stan fell in love with young, pretty
            carnival worker  Molly (Coleen Gray) - the 'Electric Girl' and current
            girlfriend of possessive Bruno the Strongman (Mike Mazurki). Fate
            intervened when Stan accidentally handed an anxious, shaky Pete a
            bottle of Zeena's wood alcohol from her prop trunk, and he died of
            poisoning. It was time for Stan to leave the carnival troupe, and
            after a quick shotgun marriage to Molly, the two fled and went on
            the road performing together with their own mentalist show. He headlined
            as  &quot;The Great Stanton&quot; at an exclusive nightclub (The Spode Room) in
            the Chicago-area's Hotel Sherman, where he performed with Molly,
            and they became a solid hit. One of their show's attendees was consulting
            psychologist Lilith Ritter (Helen Walker) who was extremely skeptical
            of Stanton's question-answering charade. To outwit him, she tested
            him but he was able to answer correctly. Later, she invited him to
            her Lakeshore Building business office, where he realized she was
            secretly recording the interview-sessions of all her wealthy, high-class
            patients. They entered into a pecuniary deceitful
            scheme and partnership to illegally use the information from her
            recordings to make money off her elite clientele by channeling their
            dead relatives. She also offered therapy sessions to Stan, that she
            secretly recorded. One rich client named Ezra Grindle (Taylor Holmes)
            hired Stan to provide &quot;spiritual communion&quot; with his lost
            sweetheart Dorrie from 35 years earlier. Lilith conspired and teamed
            up with Stan by providing him with recording information about Grindle.
            The gullible and reluctant Molly was persuaded to be in on Stan's
            scheming &quot;subterfuge&quot;
          by masquerading as the 'materialization' of the ghostly spirit of Grindle's
          dead love. During the channeling escapade, the anguished and distraught
          Grindle saw 'Dorrie' in the distance and begged for her forgiveness.
          Molly revealed that it was a fake illusion, and Grindle suddenly realized
          he had been swindled by the charade. Stan and Molly had no choice but
          to leave town. Stan also hurriedly met with Lilith and described
          their failed plan. She gave him an envelope with  $150,000 in
          cash, and encouraged him to flee and not contact her. Later, he realized
          he had been swindled, and was given only $150 dollars. He returned
          to Lilith's office and confronted her, but she treated him as one of
          her disturbed patients. She threatened that if he accused her of complicity,
          she would play the recording of his confession regarding Pete's death.
          Realizing that he had been fully tricked, Stan fled to the train station,
          where he  ordered Molly to somehow return to the carnival in Galesburg,
          IL before the train pulled away without him. Stan's fortunes and career
          were destroyed - he became a down-and-out vagrant hobo. He sought work
          in the local carnival from the new owner McGraw (Roy Roberts), but
          was refused work because he was an obvious &quot;boozer&quot; - but
            then after begging, he was offered the exploitative job of Geek.
          Unbeknownst to him, Molly was working in the carnival and devotedly
          promised to care for him: (&quot;Everything's gonna be all right now.
          I'll look after you&quot;) as Zeena had done for Pete. </font></p></td>

              Reed<br />
              Carol Reed's searing, exciting and suspenseful crime drama was
              a rich character study about a rebel leader - a doomed man-on-the-run.
              It was a great example of a post-war British film thriller (adapted
              from F.L. Green's 1945 novel) with gritty black and white cinematography.
              It began with the following crawl: &quot;This story is told against
              a background of political unrest in a city of Northern Ireland.
              It is not concerned with the struggle between the law and an illegal
              organisation, but only with the conflict in the hearts of the people
              when they become unexpectedly involved.&quot; In the film's plot,
              Irish rebel, IRA-like nationalist gunman Johnny McQueen (James
              Mason in one of his best performances) had been evading the police
              after escaping from prison six months earlier. He was hiding out
              the house of his loving girlfriend Kathleen Sullivan (Kathleen
              Ryan in her debut film) and her Grannie (Kitty Kirwan). He had
              just participated in a daring, unsuccessful payroll robbery-holdup
              attempt at a mill-factory, presumably in Belfast (Northern Ireland),
              to fund the underground operations of &quot;The Organization.&quot; He
              was lethally wounded in the left shoulder and dying after the failed
              robbery that included his own killing of the armed cashier. At
              the time of the robbery, Johnny was experiencing vision problems,
              vertigo and dizzyness - all expressionistically visualized. His
              problems multiplied when he was accidentally left behind by the
              getaway driver Pat (Cyril Cusack). He continued to experience hallucinations,
              irrationality and mental torment. Johnny lost control
              of his destiny (and free will) as he desperately struggled to avoid
              capture in the streets of Belfast, and sought shelter in
              the city's air-raid shelter, ghettos, deserted buildings, pubs,
              and back alleys (and even in a junkyard bathtub), when he couldn't
              get back to Kathleen's place. As the British dragnet
            around him closed in tighter, for eight tense hours, he was pursued
            in a manhunt by the police and others - all with their own motives
            of either helping him, dismissing him out of fear, or exploiting
              him by turning him in to the authorities to claim the &pound;50,000
              reward. They included his girlfriend Kathleen, IRA buddy-partners
              Dennis (Robert Beatty), Pat and Nolan (Dan O'Herlihy) who wanted
              to rescue him (Pat and Nolan were gunned down after informed upon
              by Theresa O'Brien (Maureen Delaney)), hansom cabdriver &quot;Gin&quot; Jimmy
            (Joseph Tomelty), Catholic priest and Johnny's childhood teacher Father Tom (W. G. Fay) ready
            to deliver last rites, bird-dealer and poor street con-man/hustler
            Shell (F. J. McCormick), barman Fencie (William Hartnell), a crazed and eccentric homosexual painter
              Lukey (Robert Newton) who wished to paint Johnny's portrait, failed
              ex-medical intern student Tober (Elwyn Brook-Jones) (Shell's housemate),
              and a sympathetic law-enforcing police Inspector (Denis O'Dea).
              With visual religious symbolism of crucifixion, McQueen became
              a Christ-like figure as a condemned man slowly approaching death.
              McQueen was compelled to pose for the painter for endless hours
              as a model for a series of Christ paintings - the artist was obsessed
              with painting the eyes of the dying man. In the
            film's violent conclusion in snowy Belfast, Kathleen met up with
              Johnny at the waterfront as the two were attempting to escape
              on a ship together that she had arranged, while the police closed
              in on them. As Johnny tired and struggled, he fell back against
              an iron gate (with arms extended in a crucifix pose), as their
              ship was leaving without them in the distance. Kathleen had protectively
              decided to transcendentally and romantically sacrifice herself
              with Johnny rather than let him endure capture and execution. She
              deliberately and wildly fired two shots. It was ambiguous whether
              she fired at the police to force them to retaliate, or killed Johnny
              to prevent him from being captured by the police. Her two shots
              drew a barrage of gunfire from the police, leaving both of them
              dead - they expired in each other's arms.</font></p>          </td>

                Build My Gallows High),</b> 97 minutes, D: Jacques Tourneur<br />
            Director Jacques Tourneur's beguiling, complex film noir about double-dealing
            and intrigue was filmed during the post WWII period, with a script
            by Daniel Mainwaring (aka Geoffrey Homes), and uncredited pulp novelist
            James M. Cain. The picture was aka <em>Build My Gallows High</em>,
            and based on Geoffrey Homes' novel, and remade as Taylor Hackford's <i>Against
            All Odds (1984)</i>, starring Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward. This
            enthralling, convoluted classic film noir was laced with doom-laden
            flashbacks from the shady past.  It told about
            a laconic, former private detective who was  caught twice in a deathly
            web. The film began as a flashback by the film's main protagonist
            Jeff Markham/Bailey (Robert Mitchum) to his fiancee-girlfriend Ann
            (Virginia Huston) - as he described his past -- driving with her
            on his way to meet with two past associates. The story actually began
            with Jeff's escape from his past - he had moved to the
            small California town of Bridgeport in the mountainous country to
            find solitude (and work as the owner of a gas station), and had changed
            his last name to Bailey. He found himself tracked down by ex-business
            associate Joe Stefanos (Paul Valentine), and was reluctantly forced
            to meet again with underworld gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas)
            at his Lake Tahoe retreat. During the drive to Tahoe, Jeff told Ann
            about how three years earlier, he had been a private detective in
            New York with partner Jack Fisher (Steve Brodie). They had been hired
            by gambler Whit to find his duplicitous girl friend, Kathie Moffat
            (Jane Greer), who had shot Whit and allegedly stolen $40,000 dollars
            before fleeing. Jeff journeyed to Acapulco where he first came under
            the lethal, deceptive erotic spell of the irresistible <i>femme fatale</i> in
            an ill-fated affair. He was forced to go into hiding when Whit and
            Stephanos suddenly appeared at Jeff's Mexico hotel, and the couple
            fled to San Francisco to live together for a short while. Jeff
            was tracked with Kathie to a remote Sierra Nevada cabin by his ex-partner
            Fisher (who was now working for Whit), where Kathie shot Fisher dead
            and left Jeff to be blamed for the killing - concluding their affair.
            Now in the present time, after arriving at Sterling's place, the
            worn-out detective Jeff learned that the double-crossing Kathie had
            returned to Whit and told him about her affair with him. The laconic
            Jeff was again being hired by Whit for one more last, unsavory assignment
            that would bring him out of retirement. He was blackmailed into helping
            the vengeful Whit, in order to redeem himself, and make up for his
            mistake in the past. Jeff was to retrieve Whit's tax papers from
            a crooked SF lawyer named Leonard Eels (Ken Niles), who threatened
            to report him to the IRS. During Jeff's involvement and return to
            his past, he became involved in another complex web of intrigue,
            passion, betrayal, double and triple-crosses, and death. His paths
            again crossed with the wicked Kathie he had once loved and lost,
            and he was again doomed and seduced by the same charming woman. Kathie
            and Whit's ally Meta Carson (Rhonda Fleming), Eels pretty secretary,
            double-crossed Jeff by conspiring to frame him as the murderer of
            both Fisher and Eels (who was killed by Stephanos), with Kathie's
            signed affidavit attesting to the fact that he had killed Fisher.
            Jeff escaped from SF when he became the object of a manhunt, and
            returned briefly to Bridgeport, where Stephanos had been secretly
            assigned by Kathie to find Jeff and kill him - Stephanos ended up
            dead instead. Jeff was finally able to confront Whit at his Tahoe
            lodge about Kathie's double-cross and Stephanos' death. There, Kathie
            shot Whit dead and persuaded Jeff to run away with her back to Mexico
            (since he could now be charged with three murders!). As they drove
            away, Jeff had alerted authorities who set up a road-block. Knowing
            that he had betrayed her, she angrily shot him dead and also perished
            in the standoff with police.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><b><font size="2">The Paradine Case (1947)</font></b><font size="2">,
            125 minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
            Based upon the 1933 novel by Robert Smythe Hichens, and noted as
            Alfred Hitchcock's final film for producer David Selznick. In the
            year 1946 in England, beautiful and exotic young wife Maddalena Anna
            Paradine (Italian actress Alida Valli) was accused of poisoning her
            blind, elderly and wealthy husband Colonel Richard Paradine, a retired
            WWI hero. However, it was unclear whether it was suicide or murder,
            or whether the hostile Canadian valet Andre LaTour (Louis Jourdan)
            was involved. Was Mrs. Paradine being falsely accused? Successful
            married London barrister-counselor Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Keane (Gregory
            Peck) was hired by the family's solicitor Sir Simon Flaquer (Charles
            Coburn) to take the case to defend the accused murderess (and possible <i>femme
            fatale</i>). Not long after, Keane fell in love with her, neglecting
            his 11 year-old marriage to his kind and loyal wife Gay (Ann Todd).
            Gay realized her straying husband's passionate relationship to his
            attractive yet enigmatic client, but supported him so that he wouldn't
            be lost to her forever if she was convicted. The trial was presided
            over by sarcastic, bullying Judge Lord Thomas Horfield (Charles Laughton).
			Blinded and infatuated by love, defense lawyer Tony Keane tried to put the
            blame on a scapegoat - the Colonel's valet LaTour, although he vehemently
            denied it. However, under cross-examination in a dramatic scene,
            LaTour revealed that he was committing adultery with Mrs. Paradine,
            and some of his conflicting testimoney raised doubts about whether
            he assisted the Colonel in committing suicide. After testifying to
            his own guilt about the affair with Anna (but not about poisoning
            the Colonel), LaTour killed himself. Then, Mrs. Paradine admitted
            that she had initiated the affair, although the valet remained loyal
            to the Colonel. When the Colonel learned of the sexual indiscretions
            of LaTour, however, the valet was discharged. Then, Mrs. Paradine
            revealed that she had poisoned her husband with a poisoned wine glass.
            In the final scene, she then denounced the disreputable Keane for
            falling in love with her, and for destroying her real love, LaTour
            due to his strategy to condemn and blame LaTour during the trial.
            Keane confessed his major limitations and his devastation over the
            revelations, and withdrew from the court. He was soon reconciled
            with his conciliatory and supportive wife Gay. For her crime, Mrs.
            Paradine was sentenced to execution (by hanging): (&quot;The Paradine
            woman will be hanged after three clear Sundays&quot;).</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Pursued (1947), </b>101 minutes, D: Raoul Walsh<br />
            Raoul Walsh's noirish, melodramatic psychological western was told
                mostly in flashback, and noted for cinematographer James Wong
                Howe's film-noir <i>chiaroscuro</i> (black and white) photography
                and Max Steiner's musical score. The western setting was the
                remote New Mexico Territory at the turn of the century.  Anti-hero,
                orphaned Jeb Rand (Robert Mitchum in an early role
				(his first lead role)) was &quot;pursued&quot; -
                literally and figuratively - by a haunted past (highlighted by
                nightmares of boots with jangling spurs and flashes of light,
                seen in flashbacks to the 1880s). He had witnessed the murder
                of his entire family as a young boy by a mysterious stranger,
                and suffered from repressed memories. [Note:
                There appeared to be a long-running feud between two families
                - the Rand family, and the Callum family.] Adopted and raised
                as a young boy by widowed &quot;Ma&quot; Callum
            (Judith Anderson), Jeb grew up with two step-siblings - &quot;Ma&quot; Callum's
            biological daughter Thorley (Thor) Callum (Teresa Wright),  and
            her son: the competitive, antagonistic Adam Callum (John
            Rodney). The main &quot;pursuit&quot; in the
            film was by villainous, one-armed county prosecutor Grant Callum
            (Dean Jagger), Ma Callum's vengeful brother-in-law, who despised
            the Rand family and sole survivor Jeb. One day when Jeb (Ernest Severn)
            was about eleven years old, his horse was shot out from under him
            by an unseen stranger (Grant) - an attempt to kill him. Grant also
            continually baited others to bring Jeb down. But why? There
          were two coin tosses that decided Jeb's fate - both of which were lost
          by Jeb. He was forced to volunteer to fight in the Spanish-American
            War, and he also was compelled to give up the Callum ranch to his
            step-brother Adam. Soon after, Jeb was forced to defend himself
            against Adam during an ambush, and he killed him in self-defense
              (determined by a jury), although Ma and Thor thought he was guilty
              of murder. He had fallen in love with Thor despite the fact that
              they were almost siblings, and that Adam had objected to their
              wedding.  Grant also prodded local boy Prentice
              McComber (Harry Carey, Jr.), one of Thor's suitors, to challenge
              Jeb to a gunfight in a dark stable - when Jeb shot and killed the
              boy. Thor and Jeb married on the hidden pretext that she had
              decided to kill him on their wedding night. Instead, she couldn't
            carry through on her promise and vowed her love instead. The
            climactic revelation was that when Jeb was younger, Grant was responsible
            for killing all the members of the Rand family, including Jeb's father,
            brother, and sister. The Rand ranch where the slaughter had occurred
            had since been abandoned. The true nature of the precipitating bitter
              feud with the Rand family was revealed. Grant Callum had revenge
          obsessions due to: (1)  &quot;Ma&quot; Callum was having an incestuous
          affair with Jeb's father; when Ma Callum's husband (Grant's brother)
          discovered the infidelity, he attempted to murder Mr. Rand (Jeb's father)
          but was killed himself. (2) In revenge, Grant slaughtered Jeb's entire
          family - Grant was the mysterious stranger of Jeb's youth. Finally,
          there was a climactic violent shootout at Jeb's and Thor's house against
          the Callums and Ma - similar to the one that killed Jeb's entire family.
          Outnumbered, Jeb was forced to surrender and was about to be hanged.
          However, in the therapeutic ending, he was saved when Ma shot Grant.
          She atoned for her actions in the past, told Jeb about the true nature
          of the forces opposing him, assured him that his childhood trauma was
          over, and saved the young married couple.</font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Secret Beyond the Door... (1947)</b>, 99 minutes,
            D: Fritz Lang<br />
          Director Fritz Lang's  psychological mystery and Freudian drama-thriller
          was told in flashback (punctuated with self-conscious, confused voice-over
          narration), and featured the tagline: &quot;Some Men Destroy What They
          Love Most!&quot; It has sometimes been noted with the year 1948. It was one of Fritz
          Lang's lesser and least-successful works, derivative and similar to
          Alfred Hitchcock's <i><a href="rebec.html">Rebecca
          (1940)</a>, Suspicion (1941) </i>and<i> Spellbound (1945), </i> and
          George Cukor's <i><a href="gasl.html">Gaslight (1944)</a></i>. Its
           great moody and shadowy black and white cinematography by Stanley
          Cortez was supplemented with a frenzied music score by Mikl&oacute;s
          R&oacute;zsa. The film opened with an engrossing dream sequence, and
          then  an extended flashback occurring on the protagonist's
          wedding day. In New York, after the heart-ailment death of her beloved
          older brother Rick Barrett (Paul Cavanagh),  
          socialite sister and fashionable heiress Celia Lamphere (Joan Bennett
          in her fourth and final film with director Lang) had a brief love affair
          with Rick's friend - family lawyer and dull financial administrator
          Bob Dwight (James Seay), and they planned to marry each other. Before
          marrying, during a vacation to Mexico with her best friend Edith Potter
          (Natalie Schafer), Celia met handsome, enigmatic and refined British
          architect Mark Lamphere (Michael Redgrave in his first US film), when
          they both witnessed a stimulating knife-fight in the marketplace between
          two locals vying for a beautiful senorita. She impulsively and recklessly
          agreed to marry him, although was apprehensive because she knew little
          about the emotionally-complex man. Soon after he skipped out on their
          wedding night, she learned that he was  the
          mysterious owner of an architecture-themed journal-magazine, and the
          owner of a heavily-mortgaged suburban mansion in Levender Falls outside
          of NYC. Celia moved into his cavernous mansion, dubbed Blaze Creek, where she
         strangely discovered that Rick's despotic yet friendly spinster
          sister Caroline &quot;Carey&quot; Lamphere (Anne Revere) administrated
          the manor. His creepy housekeeper-secretary Miss Robey (Barbara O'Neil),
          who had a scarf covering burn scars (fake) on the side of her disfigured
          face, also lived there. Most curious was that Rick had been previously married to  now-deceased
            Eleanor, and they had a weird, rebellious teenaged son named David
            (Mark Dennis) who had bitterly accused Mark of her suspicious murder.
          Mark explained his theory that a  physical setting can
          influence and define psychological reactions. One of Mark's strangest
          behaviors, as an admirer of famous historical murders, was that he
          was an eccentric collector and reproducer of  &quot;felicitous
          rooms,&quot; designed as a macabre &quot;museum&quot; to showcase and bizarrely
          recreate a half-dozen notorious murder crime scenes. When the intrigued
          Celia investigated the secret and locked room # 7 - thinking it was
          the scene of Eleanor's death, she was unsettled to learn that it might
          be prepared for her - it was an exact duplicate of her own boudoir.
          Bluebeard Mark might want to kill her for her inheritance. In the final
          revelatory scene when they were alone together, mentally-unstable Mark
          threatened to kill Celia. She forced him to recollect repressed and
          dark traumatic childhood events to ease his mind, and convince him
          he was not a murderer. [The source of his rage: his sister had locked
          him in his bedroom when he had hoped to bid his mother goodbye.] They
          discovered that disturbed pyromaniac Miss Robey, fired from her job,
          had jealously and vengefully set fire to the house. Mark redeemed himself
          by saving Celia's life, as the film ended happily.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D. Norman McLeod<br />
          This  delightful Norman McLeod comedy classic was remade by Ben Stiller
          in 2013. It was loosely adapted from James Thurber's 1939 short story
          tale about a daydreaming escapist Everyman, clumsy Walter Mitty (Danny
          Kaye) - although extended with a spy-espionage caper plot. Employed
          as an assistant editor and proof-reader for a lurid pulp fiction publisher,
          Pierce Publications, owned by idea-stealing boss Bruce Pierce (Thurston
          Hall) in New York, Walter wildly fantasized about how he was a hero
          in adventurous episodes, to escape his mundane world. He lived with
          his overbearing, nagging and overprotective mother Eunice (Fay Bainter),
          and was disrespected by his self-centered, irritating fiancee Gertrude
          Griswold (Ann Rutherford) and her loud-mouthed mother (Florence Bates),
          and by best friend Tubby Wadsworth (Gordon Jones) - a romantic rival
          for Gertrude's love and the villain in Walter's fantasies. During
          one of his fantasies while he was commuting on a train to work, he
          met mysterious and gorgeous blonde Rosalind van Hoorn (Virginia Mayo).
          The glamorous femme fatale, the girl of his dreams, pretended that
          Mitty was her sweetheart, gave him a kiss, and handed him a black book
          to evade a dangerous international group of jewel thieves, led by The
          Boot, that were pursuing her. The book allegedly contained the location
          of various stolen Dutch art treasures by the Nazis, including crown
          jewels hidden since WWII. Rosalind was allied with her uncle Peter
          van Hoorn (Konstantin Shayne), the former curator of the Royal Netherlands
          Museum, to acquire the Dutch jewels by accessing the black book. Mitty
           was diagnosed by maniacal psychiarist Dr. Hollingshead (Boris Karloff),
          actually one of The Boot's henchmen, as suffering from crazed, non-stop
          daydreaming - including the entire plot about the black book. During
          the caper escapades, Mitty's
          imaginative and grandiose dreams included him as a famous brain surgeon
          admired by a pretty love-sick nurse, an WWII British RAF flying ace
          engaged in aerial dogfights while wooing a French barmaid, a Mississippi
          riverboat gambler, a heroic gunslinger in a Western shoot-out, a sea captain with daring
            seafaring adventures during a storm,   and as gay woman's fashion
        hat designer Anatole of Paris. In the end, Mitty convinced his family
          and the authorities that he wasn't daydreaming about the spies, the
          book or Rosalind, and thereby became a brave heroic figure in reality
          - by thwarting The Boot - who was revealed to be Peter van Hoorn.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><b><font size="2">They Won't Believe Me (1947)</font></b><font size="2">,
          95/80 minutes, D: Irving Pichel<br />
          In this film noirish melodrama about adultery, philandering
              playboy Lawrence Ballentine (Robert Young) was on trial for the
              brutal murder of Verna Carlson (Susan Hayward). Before flashbacks
              to tell the defendant's unbelievable life-story (an 'unreliable
              witness' account), Ballentine's attorney Cahill (Frank Ferguson)
              claimed that his stockbroker client was innocent. Almost the entire
              film consisted of Ballentine's uninterrupted flashbacked story.
              Although married for five years to rich and loving wife Greta (Rita
              Johnson), he planned to take a train to run off to Montreal with
              tempting mistress Janice Bell (Jane Greer), a NYC magazine writer
              and one of Greta's friends. Greta tried to keep their marriage
              going by buying her husband's loyalty. She rented a Beverly Hills,
              California house, and purchased an interest in a stock brokerage
              firm. After about six months there, he again left Greta for sexy,
              femme fatale LA secretary Verna Carlson, working in his own firm.
              Greta thought she could still hold onto her husband by selling
              his interest in the partnership, and moving away with him to an
              isolated mountain ranch. Unhappy with the arrangement, Lawrence
              promised Verna that he would go to Reno to get a quickie divorce
              from his wife, and then they could begin their new life together.
              As they were driving to Reno, a truck collided with their car.
              Verna was horribly killed and burned in the wreckage, while Ballentine
              survived with a serious concussion. Ballentine realized that he
              could easily claim that it was Greta who died, so he concocted
              a complicated scheme to inherit his wife's fortune. He would carry
              out the deception by agreeing that Greta (not Verna) had died in
              the accident, then murder Greta, hide her body, and acquire her
              money. When he arrived at Greta's remote ranch, he found her already
              dead, presumably distraught over the divorce-breakup, and at the
              bottom of a cliff where she had fallen accidentally after an equestrian
              accident - or committed suicide. (However, there was one other
              real possibility: Had he pushed her, and then subconsciously felt
              guilty for murdering her?) To avoid suspicion, Ballentine left
              Greta's body to decompose in the river, and carried through with
              the rest of his scheme. Unfortunately for him, the police located
              Greta's remains, but thought it was Verna's body. Ballentine was
              charged with murder, after the police wrongly theorized that Larry
          killed Verna because she was blackmailing him over their affair. The story - told by Ballentine as
              the sole defense witness - returned to the courtroom where the
              jurors filed in with their verdict. Fearing the worst (was he actually
              guilty of a crime?), Ballentine attempted a desperate suicidal
              escape through an open courtroom window - when he was shot and
              killed. In the surprise ending, the jury's foreman read the verdict
        - not guilty! </font></p>        </td>

          </font><font size="2">Renoir's moody, nightmarish erotic melodrama
            was a psychological character study about a tormented love triangle.
            It was the director's final American film during wartime exile. The
            film was severely edited by RKO, leaving it as only a fragment of
          what it could have been. Shell-shocked Coast Guard veteran Lieutenant
          Scott Burnett (Robert Ryan) was stationed near a desolate California
          coastline during recuperation from post-traumatic stress. Although
          engaged to wholesome local girl Eve Geddes (Nan Leslie), he became
          distracted and smitten in an illicit affair with slutty and passionate <i>femme
            fatale</i> Peggy Butler (Joan Bennett). Peggy was married to renowned
            blind painter Tod (Charles Bickford) and lived in an isolated clifftop
          house with him. Peggy was obsessively guilt-ridden
          within her unhappy, imprisoning, embittered and dysfunctional love-hate
          marriage to the excessively-jealous, wife-beating man, believing she
          had to stay with him because she had caused her husband's blindness
          (by cutting his optic nerve) during a drunken brawl. Lieutenant
          Scott Burnett took it upon himself to prove that the blindness was
          faked (&quot;If I could prove to you that
            Tod wasn't really blind, would you leave him?&quot;) and in one extraordinary
            scene led the painter along a cliffside to disprove his disability. In
            the ambiguous ending, when Peggy proved her love to Scott (although
            her past as a nymphomaniacal seductress was revealed - &quot;Go ahead and say it, I'm no good&quot;), her husband Tod
            freed her by burning down their house (&quot;I am free&quot;), consuming
            all of his paintings. The reconciled couple departed to go to New
        York to start a new life, leaving Scott free to return to Eve.</font></p>        </td>
