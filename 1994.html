          <p><font size="2"><b>Clerks. (1994),</b> 90 minutes, D: Kevin Smith<br />
            Writer/director Kevin Smith's amateurishly-acted, slapped-together
                low-budget (about $30,000) comedy - his first feature film -
                went into general release after its successes at film festivals,
                and became one of the most popular and successful comedy independent
                films of all time. The grainy, B/W film was a foul-mouthed, gloomy,
                Gen-X comedy with some outrageous laughs and memorable monologues
                about two ambition-less, minimum-wage clerks in dead-end jobs
                in two Leonardo Township, NJ stores next to each other in a strip
          mall. They were unproductive college drop-out
              and 22 year-old Quick Stop Groceries store clerk Dante Hicks (Brian
              O'Halloran) and his grungy, nihilistic, slacker, anti-social RST
              Video-store clerk friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) who worked
              next door and clearly despised and abused his rental customers
          by often insulting or offending them. The film's tagline accurately
                described the main characters: &quot;Just because they serve
                you doesn't mean they like you.&quot; In the film's opening,
                Dante's day started out badly with multiple problems - he was
                called early at home to work  the morning shift beginning at
                6 AM on his Saturday day-off when a co-worker was reported to
                be sick; when he arrived, he discovered that the metal shutters
                for the storefront were jammed closed by chewing gum stuffed
                into the lock. He left a make-shift message with big letters

                Loughran (Marilyn Ghigliotti) who upset him when she described
                her previous active sex life - detailing 37 blow jobs), and Randal's
                memorable interactions with indecisive, confused, and irate customers
                (including his oblivious phone order of X-rated video titles
                while a Mom and young child stood close by waiting for the title &quot;Happy

             ex-girlfriends, and a lawsuit brought to Dante by a summons-server

          Terry Zwigoff's intriguing R-rated biopic-documentary provided a bizarre
              yet fascinating portrait of the counter-cultural, sex-obsessed,
              underground comic book artist/writer Robert Crumb. It sympathetically
              portrayed the skinny, bespectacled, geeky cartoonist, a misanthrope
              (and ex-acidhead) best known for creating 1960s-era underground
              comic books. He rose to fame with the characters of Mr. Natural

              of his Catholic family, and other acquaintances and critics brought
              out diverse opinions about Crumb - was he just another pornographic
              fetishist, misogynist, and racist releasing his own repressed inner
              demons through art, or was he a brilliant and incisive critic who

          Peter Farrelly's gross-out, un-PC, cross-country road-trip and buddy-comedy
          film was about two 'dumb' and clueless, &quot;dumb &amp; dumber&quot; roommates and
          adventuring friends in Providence, RI. The two were introduced: chip-toothed
              and grinning  limo driver Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey)
               with a bowl-style haircut, and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels), an
              entrepreneur running a mobile dog-grooming
              business (&quot;Mutts Cutts&quot;) - he had customized and converted
              his 1984 Ford Econoline van into a &quot;Poochmobile&quot; (shaped
        like a sheepdog). During an airport delivery, Lloyd became entranced
              by one of his passengers - wealthy heiress Mary Swanson (Lauren
              Holly) who was  on a trip to Aspen, CO. Strangely, Mary left her
              briefcase on the floor of the terminal, and appeared to be followed
              by two thugs:  Joe &quot;Mental&quot; Mentalino (Mike Starr) and
        J. P. Shay (Karen Duffy). Lloyd   raced inside and retrieved the case,
               and made an ill-fated attempt to return it to her. The two slacker
              roommates  were both fired from their jobs, and decided to
               set out to return the briefcase by driving to Aspen, CO. Unbeknownst
              to them, they were being pursued by the two thuggish hit-men from
              the airport. The duo's demanding boss was revealed to be mastermind
          criminal Nicholas Andre (Charles Rocket) who lived in Aspen. There
              were many very funny misadventures for the two as they made their
              way to Aspen - in a truck stop, during an encounter with a motorcycle
              cop, the accidental poisoning of &quot;hitchhiker&quot; Mentolino who was
              trailing after them, and in further instances at meal or gas stops.
              Meanwhile in Aspen, Mary became concerned that the abductors, in
              an elaborate kidnapping and extortion scheme, had not received
              the ransom money <i>intentionally</i> left
              for them in a briefcase as instructed at the airport, in exchange
              for the return of her kidnapped husband Bobby (Brad Lockerman).
              She conferred with her parents and with old family friend and confidant
              Nicholas Andre, unaware that he had masterminded the kidnapping.
              To make matters worse, Lloyd   had mistakenly took
              a wrong turn and detoured through Nebraska. Almost out of gas,
              Harry was exasperated with Lloyd's imbecility and he decided to
              desert him and walk home. Lloyd traded the van for a small mini-bike
              moped, caught up to Harry, and they decided to continue on to Aspen.
              Once there, they broke into the briefcase, saw the money, and went
              on a spending spree. They were able to meet up with Mary at a weekend
        Preservation Benefit (for Snow Owls) at Mary's home, and Harry was able
              to acquire a ski-date with her. Lloyd retaliated
              against Harry for his betrayal with Mary by putting a large dose
              of laxative in his coffee - leading to  a hilarious sequence
              in Mary's bathroom. Lloyd arrived to tell dream-girl Mary that
              he had her briefcase, then  took her to his luxury hotel to hand
              over the briefcase, and to foolishly confess his love to her. After
              mastermind Nicholas Andre (a longtime friend of the Swansons) discovered
              that the ransom money had been spent on luxury goods (and replaced
              with IOUs), he took Lloyd, Harry, and Mary hostage; they were rescued
              during a shootout by a group of trailing FBI agents. As a result,
              Nicholas and Shay were arrested and Mary was reunited with her
              husband Bobby. As the film concluded, the two broke and down-and
              out guys were walking  along a deserted Colorado road, wondering
              to themselves: &quot;When are we ever gonna catch a break?&quot; -  when unexpectedly, a
              bus group of bikinied females on tour representing Hawaiian Tropic
              stopped to ask if they would be their oil boys, but the two idiotic
              guys directed them elsewhere. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Mike Newell<br />
              Mike Newell's surprise R-rated British hit, a romantic comedy with
              explicit language and content,  told about an on-again/off-again
              romance between a British bachelor and an American female - who
              often met at weddings (and one funeral). In the opening scene set
              in London, witty, bumbling but  charming 32 year-old bachelor
              Charles (Hugh Grant) and his quirky, tone-deaf roommate Scarlett
              (Charlotte Coleman) realized that they had overslept
              and were late to a wedding - an habitual practice for both. The
              film's 'first' wedding was between Angus (Timothy Walker) and Laura
              (Sara Crowe), with Charles serving as best man (but he had forgotten
              the ring!). After the service in the church garden, Charles became
              intrigued when he was warned by his ascerbic, jealous, wealthy,
              long-time friend Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas) about one of the
              attendees wearing a very wide-brimmed black hat - an American journalist
              and fashion editor named Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; (Andie MacDowell).
            Afterwards, Charles changed his overnight plans and met up with the
            elusive, pretty and unique American Carrie in her Room 12 accommodations
            at The Lucky Boatman pub after she invited him there. The two slept
              together (an uncommitted, one night stand or tryst) - the first
              of similar encounters. The film's 'second' of four weddings was
              was officiated by nervous trainee-vicar Father Gerald; in the film's
              most hilarious sequence, the confused, inept, fumbling, malaprop-spouting
              Father Gerald mixed up the couples' names as he recited the vows
              for the &quot;awful-wedded&quot; marital
            couple, including saying &quot;Holy Goat&quot; and &quot;Holy Spigot&quot; instead
            of &quot;Holy Ghost&quot; or &quot;Spirit.&quot; Charles became immediately
            depressed when Carrie introduced him to her older, snobbish Scottish
          fiancee Hamish Banks (Corin Redgrave). After her fiancee departed for
            Scotland, Carrie again asked Charles to join her for a night-cap
            in her hotel room, and they had sex a second time. A month later,
          however, Charles was invited to Carrie's wedding in Scotland. Opportunely,
            he helped Carrie shop for a wedding dress, and afterwards, Carrie
            recounted to him that he was her 32nd sexual partner, just one before
            Hamish. Charles also confessed his love to her referencing David
            Cassidy's song: &quot;I Think I Love You,&quot; but it was already
            too late. During the film's &quot;third&quot; wedding ceremony in
            Scotland, Carrie and Hamish were married, but during toasts and dancing,
            the highly-energetic and gregarious Gareth (Simon Callow), one of
            the regular guests, collapsed to the floor from a lethal heart attack.
            In the film's sole funeral ceremony, Matthew (John Hannah) - Gareth's
            gay partner, offered memorable words of remembrance for the  &quot;jolly&quot; and &quot;splendid
            bugger.&quot; In the film's conclusion  ten months later - the film's
            'fourth' wedding, Charles had announced he was tying the knot with
            his troubled ex-girlfriend Henrietta  (Anna Chancellor). Charles
               noticed Carrie was attending - and she informed him that she had
              separated from the older Hamish after a brief marriage of only
            a few months.  They
              both realized that the timing was awful as he was about to
            approach the altar. As they were being wed and repeating their vows,
            Charles admitted, with help from his deaf younger brother David (David
            Bower) speaking in sign language, that Charles' love for Henrietta
            was in doubt and that he loved someone else. Charles'
            bride Henrietta punched him in the face to end the ceremony. The
            film ended with Carrie standing outside Charles'  home in the rain
            to apologize for causing a disruption in Charles' marriage. He was
            finally able to declare his utter and true love for Carrie, although
            in a twist, he awkwardly did <i>not</i> ask for her hand in marriage.
            She agreed: &quot;I do&quot; as the film concluded.</font></p>          </td>

           This contrived, dramatic Capra-esque romance was about
            &quot;A cop. A waitress. A lottery ticket.&quot; - the film's tagline.
            Officer Charlie Lang (Nicolas Cage), a compassionate, generous, and
            virtuous New York City (Queens) cop, bought a lottery ticket (at
            the urging of his obnoxious, shrewish and shrill wife Muriel (Rosie
            Perez)), choosing the number 26 (instead of Muriel's suggestion of
            27). During his lunch break at a coffee-shop/cafe with partner Bo
            Williams (William Pierce), Charlie realized that he didn't have cash
            to tip the friendly, hard-working, down-on-her-luck blonde waitress,
            Yvonne Biasi (Bridget Fonda). On a whim, he impetuously offered her
            1/2 of his lottery winnings the next day - if he won. As luck would
            have it, Charlie won the lottery jackpot of $4 million. The next
            day at the restaurant, Charlie presented Yvonne with a voluntary
            choice between a double-tip or 1/2 the value of his ticket. She chose
            the ticket value (and he exclaimed: &quot;A promise is a promise&quot;),
            assuring herself of his gift of $2 million. The media publicized
            the lottery results at a press conference - announcing the bargain
            between Charlie, his reluctant wife, and the waitress. Yvonne was
            being harrassed by her estranged, sleazy, blackmailing, spend-thrift
            husband Eddie (Stanley Tucci) who suddenly appeared. Optimistic Charlie
            had told Muriel, &quot;We should do the right thing,&quot; and that
            he was confident that they would still become rich and famous due
            to publicity and commercial endorsements. However, there were romantic
            and legal complications when the materialistic and greedy Muriel
            suspected Charlie of an affair with Yvonne, and threatened divorce.
            Muriel was represented by Harvey Hale (Richard Jenkins), while Charlie
            was defended by Walter Zakuto (Red Buttons). During the courtroom trial, Muriel's
              attorney demanded that the entire $4 million belonged to his client.
              Charlie would not agree to giving up Yvonne's share. Charlie testified
              that he and Yvonne were now in love, but had never met before the
              lottery ticket incident. The jury awarded Muriel the entire amount.
              Saddened by the verdict, Charlie and Yvonne visited the diner (which
              Yvonne had bought, but would now lose). Their hard-luck story and
              generosity, even in the face of disaster, was published by a undercover
              reporter/photographer named Angel Dupree (Isaac Hayes) (the film's
              narrator) who was posing as a hungry homeless man and was given
              food by the couple. In response, the generosity of New Yorkers
              brought in over $600K to help pay their debts, and they would soon
              marry. On the other hand, Muriel was swindled out of her money
              by her new husband, <i>nouveau riche</i> con man Jack Gross (Seymour
        Cassel). </font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Madness of King George (1994, UK)</b>, 107 minutes,
        D: Nicholas Hytner<br />
        Playwright Alan Bennett provided the screenplay  derived from
        his own play <i>The Madness of George III</i> that had premiered in London
        in 1991. The fictionalized biographical-historical costume drama (with
        some 'comedy of manners' elements) from acclaimed Broadway
        director Nicholas Hytner (his motion picture debut) was literally about
        the insanity of politics. It was highlighted by George Fenton's selective musical
        score of G.F. Handel's classical music. The film received a well-deserved
        Academy Award for Best Art Direction. It told about the UK's King George
        (Sir Nigel Hawthorne) who served as the regal British monarch from 1760
        to his death in 1820 at the age of 81, and was married to Princess and
        future Queen Charlotte (Helen Mirren) of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, with whom
        he had 15 children. The film mentioned how King George's 'madness' beginning
        in 1788 might have been the result of his loss of the North American
        colonies after the War of Independence (aka The Revolutionary War) from
        1775-1783. He personally lamented the loss (&quot;I've had no peace of mind
        since we lost America. Forests, old as the world itself, meadows, plains,
        strange delicate flowers, immense solitudes, and all nature new to art,
        all ours. Mine. Gone. A paradise lost&quot;). A short description following
        the film described another possible medical cause of his lunacy and unstable &quot;regal
        nonconformities,&quot; due to a bipolar psychological or mental condition known as <i>porphyria</i>         -
         a metabolic blood disease that caused his urine to change color. In
         the early portion of the film, King George III exhibited strange, eccentric
         and bizarre behavior, including excessive talking and hyperactivity,
         frenzied sexuality, and failed memory. While in attendance at a bells-concert
        of &quot;Greensleeves,&quot; he refused to let a pregnant woman sit during a reprised
        performance. He also roused his three sleepy servants at sunrise to go
        on a run with him in an open field, and at one point he was seen conversing with a tiny
        piglet. In particular, during a Handel musical concert, the misbehaving
        King George interrupted the musicians and ordered them to play louder,
        joined them on a harpsicord, and made improper bawdy sexual comments
        toward Lady Elizabeth Pembroke (Amanda Donohoe) and her shapely breasts:
        (&quot;Fine cluster there, eh?&quot;) - his wife's Lady of the Bedchamber. 
		His behavior exasperated his do-nothing son George, the Prince of Wales (Rupert Everett), and a newly-arrived
        personal equerry - Captain Greville (Rupert Graves). At the start of
        the film's palace intrigue, the Prince declared that his father was going
        mad, and separated him from his long-suffering and loving wife - the
        Queen (affectionately known as &quot;Mrs. King&quot;). The King's physician Dr.
        Warren (Geoffrey Palmer), loyal to the Prince, subjected the crazed King
        to painful heated cups applied to his body and the liberal use of laxatives,
        while his archaic, pseudo-quack Dr. Pepys (Cyril Shaps) focused almost
        solely on his piss-pot excretions. Another harsher and more unconventional
        physician, a parson-turned Dr. Francis Willis (Ian Holm), was summoned
        to treat the King's delusions using punishing methods to mold his patient's
        behavior and curb his foul outbursts by binding him to a chair and gagging
        him: (&quot;If he does not strive every day and always towards his own recovery, then
        he must be restrained&quot;). The King vehemently criticized his degrading treatment: (&quot;I am
         the King. I tell, I am not told. I am the 'verb', sir, I am not the
         'object'&quot;). At one point, the King was humiliated in public by wearing a soiled
         diaper and nightclothes, as he fought a battle of wills against his
         oppressive doctor, who was allowed to directly look at him - breaking
         court etiquette. Political machinations of those surrounding him, including
         two political parties or factions in the British Parliament: the reorganized
         Whig Party led by radical Charles James Fox (Jim Carter) that advocated
         a Regency Bill to put the scheming Prince George in power, and the Tory
         party led by the King's cold Prime Minister William Pitt (Julian Wadham).
         To do so, Lord Chancellor Thurlow (John Wood) suppressed the record
         of the Prince's illegal marriage, but then he changed his mind and revoked
         the Regency Bill after attending an outdoor play reading of Shakespeare's
         King Lear with the ousted King George. He explained how he was very
         impressed by the monarch's improved physical condition (&quot;Your Majesty
         seems more yourself&quot;). He uncovered the hidden fact  
         that young prince George had secretly married his Catholic mistress
         Mrs. Maria Fitzherbert (Caroline Harker) - a union that was declared
         invalid by his father, making him ineligible to succeed to the throne.
          In the film's conclusion, the restored and recovered King was again
         reusing his amusing spoken term: &quot;What-what?&quot; He and
          his royal family were greeted with great ceremonial pomp at St. Paul's
          Cathedral. King George III exhorted his son to act properly as part
          of their 'model family' - by waving at adoring crowds: &quot;Smile
          at the people, wave at them. Let them see that we're happy. That's
          why we're here.&quot;</font></p>

            classic from writer/director Tarantino - his second feature, about
            corruption and temptation. An interwoven series of three vignettes
            about low-life criminals, thugs, drug-dealers, hitmen, a washed-up
            crooked boxer, and restaurant-robbing lovers in the sleazy underworld

            Meanwhile, philosophically-talkative hit men Jules Winfield (Jackson)

              minutes, D: Frank Darabont<br />
            This impressive and engrossing piece of film-making was the first
            feature film of director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, who had adapted
            King's 1982 novella <i>Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption</i> (first
            published in <i>Different Seasons</i>). [Note: It was the first of
            three feature film adaptations of King's work by Darabont.] An uplifting,
            engrossing, life-affirming drama/prison tale about camaraderie was
            also a richly-detailed character study about
           the relationship between two jailed prisoners. Wrongly
            imprisoned for life in the Shawshank State Prison in the mid 1940s
            for murdering his adulterous wife and her lover, innocent banker
            Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) met another dignified lifer, kindly black
          Red (Morgan Freeman) known as a retriever who could procure contraband.
          The film was told from wise old Red's perspective (in ubiquitous calm
          voice-over, Freeman's quintessential narration). The evil, Bible-pounding
          Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) used Andy's financial background to cover
          his nefarious activities, and Red obtained a geological rock hammer
          and pinup of screen siren Rita Hayworth at Andy's request. The passage
            of time over two decades was conveyed by the pin-ups on Andy's cell
            wall, which changed from Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe, and then to
            Raquel Welch. Serving as an inspiration to the other convicts, Andy yearned for freedom
          and patiently planned for it. Red recollected about how he thought
          he had provided Andy with a harmless request - a rock hammer for his
          hobby. It proved to be their tool for emancipation, redemption, and
          ultimate salvation. Red internalized Andy's words by the film's closing: &quot;Get
        busy livin', or get busy dyin'. That's god-damn right.&quot; </font></p>        </td>

            minutes, D: Heywood Gould <br />
           In this dramatic
            crime thriller about jury tampering, the tagline described
            one female juror's motivation to obey the convicted crime boss
            on trial: &quot;To protect her child from
            the Mob, she did what any mother would have done. Lie. Deceive.
            Manipulate.&quot; Divorced single mother and small-business owner
            Valerie Alston (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) was summoned for jury duty
            and considered it her civic duty to accept. The case involved ruthless
            mob boss Rusty Pirone (Armand Assante), being prosecuted for murder
            by DA Daniel Graham (Gabriel Byrne), and defended by Attorney Leo
            Greco (Richard Portnow). To ensure a court victory, members of
            the mobster gang, including corrupt, low-life, disgraced ex-cop
            Tommy Vesey (William Hurt), forced Alston into a van at her 7-year
            old son's (Bryan Shilowich) soccer game practice, and threatened
            to kill her (and her son) if she didn't vote Pirone innocent. While
            out on bail, Pirone unlawfully entered Pirone's apartment, threatened
            her with violence if she didn't cooperate, and raped her. During
              the trial, prosecutor Graham's solid strategy was to offer leniency
              to some of the witnesses (convicts in prison) if they testified
              against Pirone. Pirone's uncle was persuaded to cooperate when
              threatened with photographs of himself conducting homosexual acts
              in prison. However, the intimidated Alston remained steadfastly
              firm in voting 'not guilty' in the jury room, where she contended
              that Pirone was set up and that his constitutional rights were
              violated. Eventually, she convinced three other jurors to vote
              with her, and Judge Feld (Robert Breuler) declared a mis-trial.
              To learn how he lost the case, Graham began a personal investigation
              into the jurors, and zeroed in on Alston. A search of her apartment
              revealed an incriminating photograph. The mobsters suspected collusion
              between Graham and Alston, and attempted to murder her (Pirone's
              hard-bitten, jealous hooker/contract killer Wanda (Kathleen Quinlan)
              participated in the murder attempt), but didn't succeed when Vesey,
              who had unexpectedly fallen in love with Alston, saved her, but
              lost his own life. In the striking conclusion, Alston attempted
              to seduce Pirone in his country home as a ploy. As he tried to
              smother her, she knifed him to death - an act of vengeful vigilantism.
              She told Graham:
            &quot;You live your life, believing in things like justice and the
              law. Then someone grabs you off the street in broad daylight. Walks
              right past the police and tells you that he'll reach out from beyond
              the grave and kill your son. You don't think about right or wrong,
        you only think about survival. You do what you have to do.&quot; </font></p></td>
