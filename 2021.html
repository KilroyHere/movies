      131 minutes, Aaron Sorkin<br />
      Writer/director Aaron Sorkin's biopic and show-biz drama, told through
      flashbacks and  various witness-perspectives, followed the fame
      and fortunes of 1950s-TV most-beloved couple: RKO's red-headed studio
      actress Lucille Ball (Nicole Kidman) who had appeared in numerous low-budget
      films, and Cuban-born singer/band-leader Desi Arnaz (Javier Bardem). After
      marrying and moving to Hollywood, Lucy's casting in the successful radio
      show <i>My Favorite Husband</i> in 1948 morphed by 1953 into a very popular
      CBS-TV comedy sit-com show renamed <i>I
      Love Lucy</i>, where the two played husband and wife. Behind the scenes,
      the couple were already facing issues regarding Arnaz's frequent cheating
      and infidelity. On the set of <i>I Love Lucy</i>, Vivian
      Vance (Nina Arianda) and William Frawley (J.K. Simmons) (portraying their
      married neighbors Ethel and Fred Mertz),  continually feuded with each
      other, and Frawley was frequently drunk. However, the hit TV show and their
      own marriage were even more threatened during a tumultuous week (
      a period known as the Red Scare), when political allegations surfaced in
      a newspaper article - claiming that Lucy was a Communist. Although Lucy
      was cleared of the charges, their martial problems intensified and ultimately
      led to Lucy filing for divorce after the taping of their last show in 1960.</font></p>      </td>

      D: Kenneth Branagh <br />
       This semi-autobiographical, B/W political and childhood
      drama, written and directed by Kenneth Branagh, was set amidst the tumult
      and turmoil of life in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s, when conflict
      and problems in the region (known as &quot;The Troubles&quot;) were occurring
      between &quot;Protestants&quot; (composed mostly of Unionists and Loyalists who
      wanted to remain united with the UK) and &quot;Catholics&quot; (composed
      mostly of Nationalists and Republicans who wanted a united Ireland). The
      main character was 9 year-old Irish boy named Buddy (Jude Hill), who had
      a brother named Will (Lewis McAskie). Buddy's grandparents were Granny
      (Judi Dench) and Pop (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds). Buddy's working-class parents 
	  Pa and Ma (Jamie Dornan and Caitriona Balfe)
      were worried that their family was in extreme danger (and might be forced
      to move), especially since they identified as 'Protestants' and were being
      pressured to take sides.</font></p>      </td>

          D: Sian Heder<br />
          The title of writer/director Sian Heder's sweet, highly-emotional,
          coming-of-age family drama and musical was taken from the acronym CODA
          (meaning 'Child of Deaf Adult'). The Best Picture Oscar winner was
          remarkable for having in its cast a trio of hearing-challenged actors.
          The only non-hearing impaired individual in the family of deaf people
          living in Cape Ann's town of Gloucester, Mass. (who were engaged in
          the fishing sales business) was talented, teenaged, 17 year-old Ruby
          Rossi (Britisher Emilia Jones), an aspiring singer with plans to attend
          college at the highly-competitive Berklee College of Music if she could
          acquire a scholarship. By signing for her family's deaf members, her
          father Frank (Troy Kotsur) and mother Jackie (Marlee Matlin) and older
          disgruntled brother Leo (Daniel Durant), they had become almost totally-co-dependent
          and reliant upon her to communicate for them - jeopardizing her chances
          of an educational future. She was also struggling to have a normal
          romantic relationship with shy schoolmate Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo),
          a member of the HS choir and her duet partner, while attending private
          singing lessons with her school's idealistic music teacher Bernardo &quot;Mr.
          V&rdquo; Villalobos (Eugenio Derbez) before auditioning
          for college. However, to fulfill her dreams, she realized that she
          would have to break away from her home and abandon her parents, who
          were pressuring her to continue as an intermediary involved in the
          family's fishing enterprise. She was resigned to her fate, until her
          parents attended her choir recital (and applauded when they saw others
          doing the same), and also secretly watched her Boston college audition
          from a balcony as she sang Joni Mitchell's 'Both Sides Now.' Remarkably,
          they remained supportive when she decided to follow her musical passion
          and proceed with her educational plans. In the film's ending, as Ruby
          was driven away, she flashed her family with one final ASL sign that
          meant: &quot;I Love You&quot; (the symbols of I, L, and Y).</font></p></td>

          minutes, D: Adam McKay<br />
          Writer/director Adam McKay's comedy about a possible, impending apocalyptic
          climate tragedy was prescient. Michigan State University Professor
          Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his astronomy grad student
          Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence) discovered a comet headed directly
          toward Earth that could potentially - in six months - destroy the entire
          planet. Their serious warnings during a whirlwind media tour fell on
          deaf ears and were met with apathy and indifference, from individuals
          including US President Janie Orlean (Meryl Streep), her Chief of Staff/son
          Jason (Jonah Hill) and two upbeat, popular morning talk show (<i>The
          Daily Rip</i>) hosts Brie Evantee (Cate Blanchett) and Jack (Tyler Perry). Individuals
          took sides over the issue - those who wished to save the planet with
          efforts to divert the comet, those who wanted to exploit the comet's
          valuable and scarce previous minerals (led by tech billionaire Peter
          Isherwell who was a prominent financial supporter of the President),
           and those who didn't believe that there was even a problem. The film concluded with a last-minute
          escape plan to avoid being obliterated - an exclusive flight on a spaceship
          to another Earth-like planet with passengers placed in cryogenic sleep.
          The comet struck Earth as predicted and killed nearly everyone (although
          there were some who survived, including Jason). During the end credits,
          22,000 years into the future, the spaceship landed on a tropical alien
          planet where the survivors were immediately attacked and killed by
          wild animals. </font></p>      </td>

      Japanese director/writer Ry&ucirc;suke Hamaguchi's contemplative, heart-wrenching,
      lengthy psychological drama about grief was adapted from  Haruki Murakami's
      2014 short story. Nominated for both Best Picture and for Best International
      Feature Film. In the story, the recently widowed Yusuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi
      Nishijima), a famed and successful stage actor/director in Tokyo, had been
      chosen to direct a new adapted production in Hiroshima of Chekov's Russian
      play <i>Uncle Vanya</i>. Two years earlier, Yusuke's TV playwright wife Oto (Reika Kirishima)
      had suddenly and unexpectedly disappeared and was presumed dead. Soft-spoken,
      initially-intimidated young Misaki Watari (Toko Miura) served as Yusuke's
      chauffeur due to safety rules, and drove him to and from the production's
       many rehearsals. She was hired to drive him in his
        own beloved, red Saab 900 (hence the title &quot;Drive My Car&quot;).
        They bonded together as he began to be haunted by thoughts that his wife
        had betrayed him and been unfaithful with handsome TV star Koshi Takatsuki
        (Masaki Okada), whom he had inexplicably cast in the current production
        as the middle-aged Vanya.</font></p>      </td>

        <font size="2">This was the second version of  Frank Herbert&rsquo;s
        popular and epic 1965 sci-fi novel (its first half), following director
        David Lynch's 1984 box-office failure. The big-budget, messianic hero's-journey
        tale (Part One) was set more than 8,000 years in the future. On the limited,
        foggy and misty oceanic planet of Caladan, gifted heir and son Paul Atreides
        (Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet) was born
        into the noble House of Atreides, consisting  of Duke Leto Atreides
        (Oscar Isaac) and witch-mother concubine Lady Jessica Atreides (Rebecca
        Ferguson), a member of the sisterhood of Bene Gesserit. Troubled by premonitions
        and visions of the future (including a Fremen woman named Chani (Zendaya)),
        Paul was entrusted with traveling
        to Arrakis (aka Dune), a dangerous, inhospitable desert planet, to protect
        the future of his family and people. Arrakis was home to a very precious
        and valuable psychogenic substance known as &quot;melange&quot; (aka &quot;the
        spice&quot;) - a drug that prolonged life and enhanced thinking and perception.
        The desert crop known as &quot;spice&quot; was also required for interstellar travel
        by navigators to instantly cover vast distances through expanded consciousness.
        Also on the planet were giant sandworms that traveled under the desert. Imperial
        politics were in full swing, as malevolent forces known as the Harkonnens
        had been fighting for many centuries over the drug with the planet's
        navite warrior-inhabitants, the Fremen. Deadly war
        was imminent in the future between the House of Atreides and their foes
        - the monstrous House of Harkonnen, once Paul arrived on Arrakis. In
        the film's conclusion, Paul joined the Fremen to fulfill his father's
        goal of bringing peace to Arrakis. </font></p>      </td>

       Disney Animation Studios' 60th  feature film, nominated for Best
       Animated Feature Film. The lively and colorful animated musical with a
       soundtrack of songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, was set in the country of Colombia.
       A magical, multi-generational family-clan known as the Madrigals lived
       there in the hillside town of Encanto (surrounded by mountains) after
       becoming refugees when they fled violence in their native land. They dwelt
       in an 'sentient,' idyllic house known as La Casa Madrigal. Each member
      of the extended family had unique, supernatural and special powers to serve
      the villagers, such as super-human hearing, cooking, flower-blooming,
      communication with animals, super-strength, or shape-shifting - except
      for the youngest daughter - the lonely and quirky 15 year-old Mirabel Madrigal
      (voice of Stephanie Beatriz) - the heroine-Cinderella character in the
      story. To restore her family's &quot;miracle&quot; (represented by a flickering,
      burning candle) and the mystery of her own weakened powers, Mirabel sought
      to investigate the cause of the family's dwindling loss of powerful magic
      (that was also damaging the Casita and creating earthquake fissures in
      the hills).</font></p>      </td>

            D: Michael Showalter <br />
          This biographical drama was based upon an earlier documentary film,
          <i>The Eyes of Tammy Faye (2000)</i>, directed by Fenton Bailey and
          Randy Barbato, and narrated by drag queen RuPaul. In
          the 1960s in rural Minnesota, small-time country-girl Tammy Faye Grover
          (Jessica Chastain) with a strict religious upbringing, met up with
          fellow college student Jim Bakker (Andrew Garfield), a professed man
          of God. They married impulsively, and took their Christian message
          on the road, with programs showcasing Jim's preaching plus Tammy's
          singing. By the mid-1960s, they hosted a popular children's show, <i>Jim
          and Tammy</i>, and then hosted <i>The
          700 Club</i> on Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network
            (CBN). Joined together as evangelists, they rose to fame through
          their inspirational and upbeat message of hope, love, and forgiveness.
          In the mid-1970s, they struck out on their own by establishing
         the world&rsquo;s largest religious broadcasting network, the PTL (Praise
         the Lord) network, centered on  their popular show <i>The PTL Club</i> (aka <i>The
         Jim and Tammy Show</i>) that lasted from 1974-1989. They also established
         a 2,500-acre mixed-use family Christian theme park and resort in Fort
         Mill, South Carolina, known as Heritage USA. However, their ostentatious
         and lucrative lifestyles (of lavishness and luxury, and Tammy's own
         problems with drug addiction) and emphasis on prosperity led to accusations
         of the misuse of financial funds, and Bakker was also charged with various
         sexual misconduct scandals and fraud. They lost control of their entire
          PTL empire when it collapsed by the late 1980s, and eventually divorced
         in 1994. </font></p>      </td>

          minutes, D: Ridley Scott </font><br />
        <font size="2">Director Ridley Scott's crime-drama thriller, a decadent,
        real-life melodramatic tale of jealousy, betrayals and backstabbings,
        revenge, and murder, was based upon Sara Gay Forden's 2001 book <i>The
        House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and
        Greed</i>. In the plot chronicling the rise and fall of a fashion empire, ambitious
        gold-digging outsider Patrizia Reggiani (Lady
        Gaga) - the  social-climbing daughter of a middle-class business owner,
        married into the Gucci family's business by tying the knot with Gucci
        family heir Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver). The Gucci empire was run by
        Maurizio's father Rodolfo (Jeremy Irons) and uncle Aldo (Al Pacino),
        who were hampered by aspiring but untalented son Paolo (Jared Leno). 
		Patrizia's  diabolical, exploitative, calculating motives were to manipulatively gain a controlling
        interest in the company, but she was hampered by Maurizio's own legal
        war against Aldo for control over Gucci after becoming Gucci's majority
        shareholder. She became enraged and resentful by an embittered Maurizio's
        infidelity when he began an affair with an old childhood friend Paola
        Franchi (Camille Cottin), and when he ultimately schemed to acquire a
        controlling number of shares of the company, although mismanagement of
        the company led to his ouster, and acquisition of almost half of the
        company by Investcorp, an equity-investment fund. Now an estranged couple,
        Maurizio sought a divorce but Patrizia initially refused (although their
        split was finalized in 1994), while she made plans to assassinate him
        with the aid of celebrity psychic Giuseppina &quot;Pina&quot; (Salma
          Hayek), who put her in contact with hit-men &quot;from Sicily.&quot; In the midst
          of deep financial struggles and after a major sell-off of Gucci stock,
          Maurizio was gunned down in the spring of 1995 in broad daylight outside
          his Milan office. Subsequently, Patrizia, Pina, and the hitmen were
          arrested for murder, convicted and sentenced to prison. The
          end credits stated that the powerful fashion house no longer involved
          a single Gucci family member. </font></p>      </td>

      minutes, D: Reinaldo Marcus Green <br />
       This biographical drama from indie director Reinaldo Marcus
      Green told about the hard-driving Richard Williams (Will Smith), the persistent,
      over-bearing father (and coach) of two aspiring daughters - tennis stars
      Serena (Demi Singleton) and Venus Williams (Saniyya Sidney). Hard-working
      as a night security guard, he lived in Compton, California with his wife
      Oracene &quot;Brandy&quot; Price (Aunjanue Ellis) and three step-daughters, 
	  plus Serena and Venus. To propel them to stardom and extract them from their tough South Central
      LA environment, he began by assertively writing a 78-page manifesto of
      his unorthodox plans, plus brochures and videotapes. He reluctantly  hired
      pro coach Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn) to coach Venus, but then decided to
      take it upon himself to supervise the coaching of the two girls due to
      the exorbitant expense of hiring a professional. They trained on rugged,
      public tennis courts in their hometown of Compton, CA. The movie mostly
      focused on the rise of Venus' tennis career, while Serena was close-behind
      in the shadows. In the 1990s, the family found themselves treated as outsiders
      amongst the restrictive, predominantly white, upper-class competition,
      on and off the court. Once the girls were recognized for their talent,
      the family relocated to Florida to train at coach Rick Macci's (Jon Bernthal)
      tennis camp. The temptations of being taken advantage of, succumbing to
      media pressures, and being sponsored for extravagant sums of money by big-name
      sports brands were ever-present. The end credits (to the tune of Beyonc&eacute;'s
      &quot;Be Alive&quot;) presented the many accomplishments of the 
	  Williams' players with documentary footage
      - as a teen, Venus signed a lucrative contract with Reebok, won 5 times
      at Wimbledon, and became the first African American woman to be ranked
      number one in the world. Serena's career was even more successful - she
      became a 23-time Grand Slam champion and was one of the greatest tennis
      players in sports history. </font></p>      </td>

            Thomas Anderson<br />
          The title of writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's nostalgic, quirky
              coming-of-age romantic drama was derived from the name of a regional
              record store chain (now defunct) that was established in Southern
              California (San Fernando Valley) in the early 1970s, but was bought
              out by Sam Goody. [Note: Its initials LP stood for &quot;Long Playing&quot;
              - a reference to black vinyl records round-shaped like a pizza.]
              The events of the films were loosely based on the director's own
              youth in SoCal. The main story (about a first love) told of the
              budding relationship between two mismatched youths with clashing
              personalities separated by 10 years of age: 15 year-old opportunist,
              overconfident teen actor Gary Valentine (the late Philip Seymour
              Hoffman's 18 year-old son, Cooper Hoffman in his debut role), and 25-year-old
              Alana Kane (29 year-old Alana Haim also in her film debut - a musician
              in the female trio rock band Haim), a photographer's assistant.
              They first met during a yearbook picture-taking session at his
              HS (Grant), and afterwards, Gary's manager-mother Momma Anita (Mary
              Elizabeth Ellis) allowed Alana to chaperone him to NYC to attend
              a cast reunion for the family comedy-variety show &quot;Under One Roof&quot;
              (a stand-in for the film <i>Yours, Mine, and Ours (1968)</i>).
              In 1973, it was a time of the gas crisis, the 'waterbed' craze
              and legal prohibitions against pin-balling - facts worked into
              the film when budding, entrepreneurial hustler Gary attempted various
              business schemes. He started a waterbed company, partnered with
              Alana, and in a comic sequence, they delivered a waterbed to the
              home of crazed, womanizing hairdresser Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper)
              - a real-life Hollywood producer who was dating actress/singer
              Barbra Streisand. The waterbed destroyed the house during
              a disastrous installation. Gary also took advantage of the legalization
              of pinball in 1973 by opening a game arcade. Through many common
              scenarios and their tumultuous misadventures, they were increasingly
              drawn to each other and became soul-mated friends. </font></p>      </td>

            Gyllenhaal <br />
          Actress-turned-director Maggie Gyllenhaal&rsquo;s feature-directing
          and writing debut - a psychological drama and character study about
          motherhood - was based on Italian author Elena Ferrante&rsquo;s
          2006 novel. In the film's plot, middle-aged, late 40s English professor
          and language scholar Leda Caruso (Olivia Colman as older adult) was
          a single divorcee with two grown children (who had departed to be with
          their father in Canada). While summer beach-vacationing in a rented
          villa in the small coastal town of Spetses in Greece, during a 'working
          vacation,' Leda  grew increasingly obsessed watching an impatient mother named Nina (Dakota
          Johnson) playing with her 3 year-old daughter Elena (Athena Martin)
          (with a favorite toy doll). When the child and her doll briefly disappeared,
          Leda found the girl but inexplicably and strangely purloined her doll,
          took it to her room and secretly cared for it. Other characters included
          the hotel's manager-caretaker-handyman Lyle (Ed Harris), and his resort
          assistant, bartender and beach-keeper Will (Paul Mescal) who became
          involved in an affair with the depressed Nina. It was revealed that
          Nina was in an unhappy marital relationship with her controlling husband
          Toni (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). All of the events and interactions triggered
          the literary academic Leda to suffer from troubling and haunting flashbacks
          decades earlier to her youth (portrayed as younger by Jessie Buckley).
          Feeling guilty, she remembered and perceived her 
		  own period of &quot;unnatural&quot; motherhood as
          difficult (for her own children Bianca and Martha), when her academic
          career was in its ascendancy. She recalled how as an 'unfit' mother,
          she made a life-changing decision to abandon her two daughters after
          three years, when she was in a promiscuous
          affair with fellow Professor Hardy (Peter Sarsgaard, the director's
          real-life husband) during an out-of-town conference. While offering
          advice and warnings to Nina, Leda returned the stolen doll - prompting
          an enraged Nina to stab Leda with her long sun-hat hairpin. Later that
          evening (actually the film's opening scene), the wounded Leda (bleeding
          from her abdomen) packed up and drove off from the resort, but crashed
          her car and ended up collapsing on a beach shoreline. After awakening
          the next morning, Leda phoned her grown daughters - a sign of possible
          reconciliation and healing.</font></p>        </td>

      <p><b><font size="2">Nightmare Alley (2021)</font></b><font size="2">,
          150 minutes, D: Guillermo del Toro<br />
          Co-writer/director Guillermo del Toro's intriguing crime-mystery thriller
          was an adaptation of William Lindsay Gresham's hard-boiled and gritty
          1946 novel, first made into a stylish film noir in 1947 by Edmund Goulding
          and starring Tyrone Power. In the remake's neo-noir plot set in the
          late 1930s and early 40s, traveling carnival worker Stanton &quot;Stan&quot;
          Carlisle (Bradley Cooper), an ambitious and manipulative con-artist,
          had joined after leaving his Midwestern roots, murdering his
          alcoholic father and  burning of the corpse inside his cursed childhood
          home - a wooden cottage. Seedy carnival owner Clement &quot;Clem&quot; Hoately
          (Willem Dafoe) explained how he could easily take advantage of down-and-out
          drifters to work as the carnival's side-show 'geek' - a performer who
          would spectacularly bite off the heads of live chickens for audiences.
          Stan became enamoured by virginal co-worker Molly Cahill (Rooney Mara),
          who stage-performed as an electricity-conductor. The
          smooth-talking Stan also set his sights on success in the world by
          learning the deceptive trickery (coded language signals) of an old
          husband-and-wife couple: carny clairvoyant tarot-card reader Madame
          Zeena Krumbein, the Seer (Toni Collette) and her alcoholic husband
          Pete (David Strathairn). One night after accidentally providing Pete
          with a lethal bottle of toxic wood alcohol, Stan fled from the carnival
          with Molly. Two years later, the pair had become successful as a 
		  stage-performing, mentalist psychic-act
          duo in an Art Deco supper-nightclub for swanky and rich audiences in
          the city of Buffalo, NY. During one evening's performance, psychiatrist
           Dr. Lilith Ritter (Cate Blanchett)
          was in the audience and attempted to expose Stan's deceptive and phony
          techniques - but failed to embarrass him. He thought he had duped her
          - but not for long. Soon after, Stan was employed by wealthy Judge
          Kimball (Peter MacNeill), who believed that Stan could show him and
          his wife how to communicate with their dead son. Meanwhile, Stan had
          fallen in love and collaborated with the blonde<i> femme
          fatale</i> Dr. Ritter as his slinky con-artist associate (to provide
          background information on his scam-victims for their mutual benefit),
          to swindle and con the Judge and other elite members of the local society
          for greater monetary rewards. (Later, the Judge and his wife were found
          dead in a murder-suicide while vainly trying to reunite with their
          son.) During a climactic scam-act to swindle abusive Ezra Grindle (Richard
          Jenkins), Stan convinced Molly (who was on the verge of abandoning
          him) to appear as a dead female named Dorrie - Ezra's lover who had
          died following a failed abortion. The scam failed when Dorrie was revealed
          as a fake, prompting Stan to murder both Grindle and his bodyguard-associate
          Anderson (Holt McCallany). The film's main concluding revelation was
          that Dr. Ritter, in a turn-around battle of wits, had been scamming
          Stan - she threatened to use her audio recordings of their therapy
          sessions to expose his mental illness. She shot Stan in the ear before
          he murdered her by strangulation. He fled from authorities, and ended
          up both alcoholic and homeless, and begging for the &quot;Geek&quot; job
          from another carnival owner. The film's last line was Stan's acceptance
          of the Geek job while simultaneously laughing and crying: &quot;Mister,
          I was born for it.&quot;</font></p>      </td>

      <font size="2">The 25th installment of the long-running spy series: 
	  <i><a href="series-jamesbond0.html">James
      Bond film franchise</a></i>. The blockbuster film's plot opened with a
      prologue explaining how Agent 007 James Bond's (Daniel Craig in his last
      outing as MI6 agent) former partner and psychotherapist Dr. Madeleine Swann
      (L&eacute;a Seydoux) was connected to the film's new and powerful, adversarial
      terrorist villain: Lyutsifer Safin (Rami Malek). When Madeleine was a young
      girl living in Norway, Lyutsifer (wearing a porcelain Noh mask) made a
      failed attempt to murder her father Mr. White (working for SPECTRE), but
      was able to kill her mother. Madeleine responded by shooting Safin but
      he survived, and saved her when she fell through broken ice on a frozen
      lake. In a flash-forward to the present, Dr. Swann was in the hilltop village
      of Matera, Italy with Bond when he was attacked by SPECTRE assassins led
      by  mercenary henchman Primo (Dali Benssalah), during Bond's visit
      to deceased girlfriend Vesper Lynd's tomb (who died in the conclusion of <i>Casino
      Royale</i>). Both escaped, though Bond suspected that Swann had double-crossed
      him. Although she firmly denied the charges, he compelled
      her to leave on a train and they broke up. [Later,
      it was revealed that the SPECTRE ambush was staged and that Swann had not
          betrayed him.]  Flash-forward to five years
          later, when a rogue MI6 scientist Valdo Obruchev (David Dencik), who
          invented a lethal, DNA-targeting bio-weapon during work on Project
          Heracles, authorized by Bond's superior M (Ralph Fiennes), was kidnapped
      from an MI6 laboratory. Slightly facially-scarred bioterrorist Lyutsifer's
      heist motivation was to take possession of the deadly nanobot weapon for
      his own nefarious purposes. Meanwhile, Bond was in retirement from MI6
      in Port Antonio, Jamaica, where he was reluctantly recruited and convinced
      to leave retirement to find Obruchev by his old CIA friend Felix Leiter
      (Jeffrey Wright) (and colleague CIA agent Logan Ash (Billy Magnussen) -
      later revealed to be a duplicitous double-agent). Bond also met the new
      007 agent - his successor - MI6 agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch), who urged him
      to not get involved in her separate search for Obruchev. In Santiago de
       Cuba, Bond met with  Leiter's allied and sexy CIA colleague  named Paloma
      (Ana de Armas), and the two infiltrated a formal SPECTRE party. The imprisoned
      SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), Bond's continuing
      arch-enemy, was conducting a virtual meeting  with
      the SPECTRE members at the party (via a &quot;bionic eye&quot;) with plans
      to kill Bond, but the plan backfired when Obruchev's reprogrammed bio-weapon
      'mist' reverse-infected all of the SPECTRE enemy members and destroyed
      them. Bond recaptured the kidnapped scientist Obruchev, and extracted him
      to a boat to meet with Felix and Ash, but the mission failed when double-agent
      Ash shot and killed Leiter, seized Obruchev, and escaped. Bond confronted
      Blofeld in Belmarsh prison to find out where Obruchev has been taken with
      the nanobots, where he became infected by touching Dr. Swann (she had been
      blackmailed by Safin to agree to being infected in order to kill Blofeld).
      Then during a struggle with Blofeld, Bond unintentionally but lethally
      infected Blofeld during an attempt to strangle him, carrying through on
       Safin's plan. In a backstory explanation, Bond tracked Dr. Swann
      to her childhood home in Norway, where she revealed a 5 year-old daughter
      named Mathilde Swann that she insisted was not fathered by Bond. She told
      Bond that her father Mr. White (through Blofeld's orders) had poisoned
      Safin's parents when he was only a boy. Afterwards, Safin had inherited
      his father Gostan's large pharmaceutical empire. Thus, Safin had been engaged
      in a vengeful rampage against Blofeld and SPECTRE, Dr. Swann and Mathilde,
      and Bond. During a confrontation in the Norwegian countryside, Bond avenged
       Leiter's death by killing Ash and many of his cohorts, but Dr. Swann
      and Mathilde were successfully taken hostage by Safin via helicopter. In
      the film's conclusion at Safin's island lair HQ (a WWII-era missile base
      located between Japan and Russia),  Safin was holding Swann and her
      young daughter Mathilde. He announced his deadly intentions to unleash
      Obruchev's mass-produced nanobots bio-weapon upon the entire world. Bond
      managed to rescue Dr. Swann and Mathilde from captivity and get them to
      safety via boat, with assistance from Nomi, who killed Obruchev by pushing
      him into a nanobot vat. Bond sacrificially remained behind in the HQ's
      control room to open the blast-resistant silo doors - to insure that a
      missile strike, orchestrated by Bond's superior M  from
      the nearby <i>HMS Dragon</i>, would succeed. The missiles were designed to completely destroy the bio-weapons
        within the factory, including killing Safin's remaining men (including
        Primo). In the tense ending, as the clock was ticking after the missiles
        were launched and Bond was being aided by MI6's equipment quartermaster
        Q (Ben Whishaw), he was attacked by Safin who shot him several times
        and infected him by spraying him with mist from a vial of the bio-weapon
       (genetically programmed to lethally infect Swann and Mathilde) into his
      face. After killing Safin, and knowing that he was fatefully doomed, Bond
      opened the silos, and then sorrowfully bid goodbye (via walkie-talkie radio)
      to Madeleine as she confessed that he had fathered Mathilde, before the
      missiles rained down on him and destroyed the factory.</font></p>      </td>

          <font size="2">Wrier/director Pedro Almod&oacute;var's
          family drama involved two strangers, both single females who unexpectedly
          became pregnant: middle-aged, almost 40, professional photographer
          Janis Mart&iacute;nez Moreno (Pen&eacute;lope
          Cruz), and younger, more traumatized, fragile and scared adolescent
          teen Ana Manso Ferreras (Milena Smit). Janis had become pregnant after
          sleeping with well-known, married forensic archaeologist Arturo (Israel
          Elejalde) whose wife was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. Both women
          shared a Madrid maternity ward hospital bedroom where they were about
          to give birth, while building an unexpected, solid and close bond.
          After  two baby girls were born, Arturo questioned the
          parenthood of Janis' baby Cecilia, and a maternity test revealed that
          Janis was <u>not</u> Cecilia's
          biological mother. She kept the shocking news a secret. Months later,
          Janis and Ana were reunited, and figured out that Ana's baby Anita
          had suffered a crib death, and their babies had  mistakenly been
          switched in the hospital. After Janis hired Ana to be a live-in maid
          and nanny, Janis collected saliva samples to take another maternity
          test that confirmed that Cecilia was Ana&rsquo;s
          daughter. Ana also confessed that her pregnancy was the result of a
          gang rape by her classmates, that was hushed up due to pressure from
          her father. Arturo reappeared in Janis' life and told her that his
          wife had recovered from cancer, but that they were separating. In the
          climactic ending, Janis confessed to Ana the truth of Cecilia's birth,
          causing the dismayed Ana to take the baby away, but then called the
          next morning - to reconcile with Janis and allow her to see the baby.
          Months later, Janis revealed to Ana that she was again pregnant (3
        mos.) by Arturo. She had also petitioned Arturo to excavate a mass grave
        in her home village, where her great-grandfather and several other men
          from her home village had been executed in July 1936 by Spain's dictator
          Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. She
          vowed to name the baby depending on its gender - either Ana or Antonio
          (after her great-grandfather).</font></p>      </td>

      126 minutes, D: Jane Campion<br />
      Based upon the 1967 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Thomas
      Savage (a closeted gay family man), this romantic drama, character study
      and western was shot on location in New Zealand, to represent mid-1920s
      Montana. The title of the film referred to a carved shape of a barking
      dog in  the side of a mountain, and to a Bible verse. In
      the plot with themes of bullying-masculinity and repressed homosexuality,
      brazen, hard-hearted rancher Phil Burbank (Benedict Cumberbatch) constantly
      ridiculed his kind-hearted, likeable brother George's (Jesse Plemons) new
      wife - the previously-widowed inn owner Rose Gordon (Kirsten Dunst) and
      especially her frail and effeminate son Peter Gordon (Kodi Smit-McPhee)
      who had a lisp. With great animosity, cruelty and harsh anger, Phil believed
      that Rose had married George for his money and often mocked, belittled
      and taunted her, causing her to secretly begin to excessively drink alcohol.
      George's wealth helped to send Rose's &quot;sissy&quot; son Peter to medical
      school to study diseases and surgery, following in the footsteps of his
      alcoholic medical-doctor father who had committed suicide by hanging. When
      Peter came home for the summer, he came across evidence that the abusive
      Phil was hiding the fact that he was attracted to men - he found a stash
      of magazines of nude men, and spotted Phil bathing naked with a handkerchief
      around his neck. Clues  to Phil's sexual orientation
      were clear - the handkerchief belonged to  his late homosexual
      mentor - a mysterious character he loved known as Bronco Henry. Peter realized
      that his own mistreatment was Phil's defense mechanism regarding his own
      self-hatred. Over time, the tormenting Phil began  to express a strange
      friendship for Peter and taught him western skills, such as riding a horse
      and roping with a rawhide lasso. Peter also learned that Phil's life had
      been saved by Bronco Henry during freezing weather, when the men laid naked
      together in a bed roll. Phil acquired a serious hand wound acquired while
      repairing a fence, and after the open gash became severely infected, he
      unexpectedly died. At his funeral, the doctor diagnosed that Phil probably
      died from the infectious disease anthrax - although Phil had always avoided
      diseased cattle. In the anti-climactic finish, Peter read a passage from
      the Book of Common Prayer about burial rites, and stopped on Psalm 22:20: &quot;Deliver
      my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.&quot; In
      the film's twist, there were strong implications that Peter had deliberately
      infected his uncle Phil (to bring harmony to his family) by having him
      come into contact with a piece of rawhide (for the construction of a lasso
      rope) that he had cut from an diseased cow. </font></p>      </td>

      The 27th film in  <i><a href="superheroes-marvel.html">Marvel's Cinematic
      Universe</a></i> was a continuation of the <i>Spider-Man franchise,</i> and featured an appearance
      by all three of the actors who  starred as the title character in <i>Spider-Man</i> movies
      over the past 20 years. Peter Parker's (Tom Holland) true identity
      was unmasked by his old enemy Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) (posthumously)
      - when he was revealed as web-slinger Spider-Man. Doctored video footage
      of the identity reveal was released by J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons)
      of sensationalist news website <i>TheDailyBugle.net, </i>as  Spidey was
      declared a murderer and war-criminal. Parker was relieved that his smart
      girlfriend MJ (Zendaya), his best friend Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) and
      Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) knew the truth about him, but so did the entire
      world and it immediately became problematic. Parker, MJ, and Ned also found
      themselves rejected from attending MIT. To remedy the situation, Parker asked 
	  world-reknowned surgeon Dr. Stephen
      Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in the New York Sanctum Sanctorum (on Bleeker
        St.) to make his identity a secret again. Dr. Strange devised a dangerous
        spell, but it became corrupted and damaged by destabilization caused
      by repeated alterations. The spell went awry and ripped a hole in the
      multiverse. As a result, dangerous villainous bad-guy foes (&quot;visitors&quot;)
        from alternate realities (from earlier iterations of the <i>Spider-Man</i> saga)
        arrived and began wreaking havoc. The deadly enemies included (in order):
        Doc Ock/Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), the Green
        Goblin/Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the Lizard/Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys
        Ifans), Electro/Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), and Sandman/Flint
        Marko (Thomas Haden Church). In addition,  alternate Peter Parkers known
        as &quot;Peter-Two&quot; and &quot;Peter-Three&quot; (Tobey Maguire and
         Andrew Garfield) were also summoned from a different universe.
        Dr. Strange's objective was to send the villains back to their respective
        universes, although there were serious delays and other tragedies (i.e.,
        the death of Aunt May) after Parker argued that the villains had to first
        be reformed and cured of their evil powers. Ultimately,
        Beck's damage was undone when  Strange eventually magically erased  the
        world's knowledge of Peter Parker's existence from everyone's memory. </font></p>      </td>

      115 minutes, D: Lin-Manuel Miranda<br />
      This magical musical drama, director Lin-Manuel Miranda's debut feature
      film, adopted the title of gifted 1990s 
      composer/lyricist Jonathan &quot;Jon&quot; Larson's (Andrew Garfield)
      own 1992 semi-autobiographical solo rock monologue. The biopic portrayed
      the brief life of Larson, who suddenly died at the age of 35 (due to an aortic aneurysm)
      on the night  before his groundbreaking Broadway rock opera <i>Rent</i> opened
      for  its first preview performance in 1996. The film opened as aspiring
      playwright Larson sensed that his time was limited, since he had been hoping
      to write and produce a great musical since the early 1980s. Now in 1990
      before turning the age of 30, he was living in a cheap SoHo apartment while waiting tables
      at NYC's Moondance Diner. He was preparing rehearsals for
      a workshop (at Playwrights Horizons) on a futuristic, sci-fi rock musical
      that he had been working on for many years - a '1984'-inspired work titled <i>Superbia. 
	  </i>He compared himself to his revered idol Stephen Sondheim (Bradley
      Whitford) who had made his Broadway debut at age 27. The 
      small circle of friends surrounding Jonathan included ex-dancer/teacher-girlfriend
      Susan (Alexandra Shipp) who was pressuring him for a commitment, and his
      best buddy and former roommate Michael (Robin de Jes&uacute;s), an ex-actor 
      who had been diagnosed with AIDS and had given up theatrical acting for
      a more lucrative and successful career in advertising. Jonathan was upset
      by news that fellow waiter Freddy (Ben Levi Ross) was HIV-positive and
      hospitalized. As a struggling and aspiring creative artist in musical theatre,
      the increasingly-anxious Jonathan was distracted by challenging personal
      issues that blocked his song-writing talents, his own lack of self-confidence
      and feelings of failure, and temptations to take more stable corporate
      work to make ends meet. Although his workshop performance of  <i>Superbia</i> was
      highly praised, he received no offers, and he viewed it as rejection. Nonetheless,
      he persevered with the support of Susan and Michael, and was on the verge
      of success with <i>Rent</i> (about five years later) when he died.</font></p></td>

            Director Joel Coen (with his first solo feature without brother Ethan's
            help) adapted Shakespeare's 1623 classic that
            has been filmed many times from the silent film era to the present
            (from filmmakers such as Orson Welles in 1948, Akira Kurosawa in
            1957, and Roman Polanski in 1971), in addition to many TV adaptations.
            In this B/W historical drama (filmed and interpreted as a neo-noirish
            crime-thriller), the film opened after Scottish general Macbeth (Denzel
            Washington) fought a victorious battle for King Duncan (Brendan Gleeson),
            but was rewarded with the lesser title of Thane of Cawdor, while

            become convinced by a trio of witches (a  contortionist triumvirate
            of &quot;weird sisters&quot; all played by Kathryn Hunter) that he was destined
            to become King of Scotland. His ambitious, cruel and childless Machiaveillian
            wife Lady Macbeth (Frances McDormand, director Coen's wife) supported
            him and plotted with him to seize power. The first to suffer the
            machinations of Macbeth and his wife was the current King Duncan
            himself (and his servants) in a ruthless act of regicide. Duncan's
            heir-son Malcolm fled to England, as Macbeth assumed the kingship.
            Further assassinations were ordered to solidify Macbeth's reign,
            including the murder of Macbeth's friend and fellow warrior Banquo
            (Bertie Carvel) and attempted murder of Banquo's son Fleance (Lucas
            Barker). As the tyrant Macbeth took power and more blood was spilt,
            he began to suffer from fearful, guilt-ridden hallucinations (of
            the ghosts of his victims, including Banquo's appearance at a royal
            banquet), and his sleeping-walking wife Lady Macbeth became increasingly
            mad as she babbled about her complicity in the &quot;unnatural deeds.&quot;
            The witches appeared again to cryptically and prophetically foretell
            that Macbeth should remain wary of fugitive Malcolm (who was raising
            troops) and of Scottish lord Macduff (Corey Hawkins), who sought
            revenge for the earlier brutal executions of his wife (Moses Ingram), son (Ethan
            Hutchinson) and servants. Ultimately, 
            the treacherous Lady committed suicide (off-screen). The premonitions
            came true - Malcolm's troops marched on Macbeth's stark castle at
            Dunsinane, and Macduff (not born of a woman but instead &quot;untimely
            ripped&quot;) challenged Macbeth to a duel, resulting in Macbeth's beheading. Malcolm was
            crowned the new King of Scotland. Banquo's son Fleance, who had been
            prophesied to be in the line of kings, survived the bloodbath and
            was whisked away to safety by intermediary Ross (Alex Hassell) who
            had been shrewly playing both sides.</font></p>      </td>

      <p><b><font size="2">West Side Story (2021)</font></b><font size="2">,
      156 minutes, D: Steven Spielberg<br />
      Steven Spielberg's reimagined remake version (his first musical) was again
      loosely based on Shakespeare's &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;
      - it was  originally a Broadway stage musical in 1957 that became a
      Best Picture-winning film in 1961 from co-directors Robert Wise and Jerome
      Robbins.  In the familiar musical romantic drama (with a racially-charged
      love story at its center), gang rivalry in the mid-1950s in Manhattan's
      Upper West Side was occurring in numerous &quot;rumbles&quot; between Puerto
      Rican youths (the Sharks led by hot-headed Bernardo (David Alvarez), who
      was in love with Anita (Ariana DeBose)) and nativist white gangs (the Jets
      led by Riff (Mike Faist)). As the film opened, Bernardo's
      beautiful and charming sister Maria (Rachel Zegler in her feature film
      debut) was engaged to marry Sharks' gang-member Chino (Josh Andr&eacute;s
      Rivera). However, at a HS dance, Maria met Tony (Ansel Elgort), a friend of Jet
      leader Riff, and the two fell in love at first sight, angering Bernardo.
      A secret, star-crossed love affair defying blood ties developed between
      the two members of the opposing groups. As a parolee, Tony's past was marred
      by a one-year prison term  he had served after nearly killing a rival
      gang member. In the &quot;balcony&quot; scene on a fire escape at the Cloisters
      Museum, the couple expressed their love for each other by  singing
      the lovers' duet  &quot;Tonight.&quot; Tony and Maria's efforts
      to forestall a large rumble between the gangs failed, and during the conflict,
      Bernardo fatally stabbed Riff. In raging retaliation, Tony stabbed Bernardo
      to death. Afterwards, Chino plotted to vengefully kill Tony. When Maria
      sent Anita to warn Tony about Chino's intentions, she was nearly gang-raped
      by the Jets. Traumatized by the attack, she spitefully and falsely claimed
      that Chino had killed Maria. When Tony heard the rumored news of the death
      of his lover Maria, he emerged in the streets begging for Chino to kill
      him. The film's conclusion climaxed in a sad and violent finale-showdown
      when Tony was shot by Chino and died in Maria's arms. Sorrowful
        and distraught, Maria confronted both gangs and chastized them for the
        senseless deaths they had caused. </font></p>      </td>
