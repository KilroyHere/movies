          <p><font size="2"><strong>Animal Farm (1954, US-UK)</strong>, 72 minutes,
              D: Joy Batchelor, John Halas<br />
              Halas and Batchelor's intelligent, British-American adult-oriented
              production was the first feature-length animated film (in
              general release) made in England. The animation was a visualization
              of George Orwell's &quot;memorable fable&quot; - a political and
              allegorical 1945 novella about farm animals (all voiced in the
              film by Maurice Denham), who suffered abuse and rebelled against
              their cruel and sadistic human owner - but their new, victorious
              revolutionary socialistic government led by a dictatorial, Stalinist
          leader became even more tyrannical. At the previously-thriving Manor
              Farm in the English countryside in the springtime, a farmyard's
              abused animals (representing Bolshevik and liberal revolutionaries)
              were being neglected and unfed by their mean and sadistic owner
              Mr. Jones. All of the disgruntled animals called for a secret
              meeting in the barn led by wise old prized boar-hog Old Major (representing
              Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin). The meeting was
              attended by the strong, old and hard-working Boxer (a horse), his
               young friend Benjamin (a donkey), two other pigs: Snowball and
              Napoleon amongst other pigs, and many other animals. The aging
              Old Major (before  his own predicted death) encouraged
              the other animals to overthrow their tyrant owner to gain their
              freedom. The infuriated animals determinedly broke into the locked-up
              supplies of grain and feed in the barn's storehouse. Mr. Jones
              gathered reinforcements from neighboring farmers with pitchforks
              and other implements to recapture his farm; the fighting was fierce,
              due to Snowball's organized offensive tactics and strategies, and
              the humans were ultimately forced to flee. Snowball  (representing
              Leon Trosky) - the first leader of the new society (dubbed &quot;ANIMAL
              FARM&quot; - MANOR was crossed out), set up a new code of conduct
              in which the animals would all be equal, free, and happy. Five
              established Commandments or laws of the community were painted
              on the wall of the barn, including: &quot;No
              Animal Shall Sleep in a Bed&quot;, &quot;No
              Animal Shall Drink Alcohol&quot;, &quot;Four
              Legs Good Two Legs Bad&quot;, &quot;No Animal
              Shall Kill Another Animal&quot;, and &quot;All
              Animals Are Equal.&quot; The farm lands became very productive
              and successful, especially due to the tireless efforts of workhorse
              Boxer and Benjamin. Snowball also suggested
          building a windmill as a way to generate and produce energy (electricity,
          heat, and light) to improve the animals' living conditions. The sly
              and devious Napoleon (with his second-in-command Fat
              Pig Squealer) secretly plotted against Snowball, with the backing
              of Napoleon's grown-up litter of powerful and obedient <i>black</i> guard
              dogs that served as his powerful security force. Napoleon criticized,
              heckled and voted down Snowball's plan as fanciful and nonsensical,
              and then ordered his trained, vicious and snarling dogs to attack
              and chase Snowball out into the snow and maul him to death. Then,
              he heartlessly became the new controlling, self-proclaimed leader
              of Animal Farm. He denounced Snowball  as a traitor, and announced
              that he would serve as the sole animal to look after everyone and
              make all the decisions for the community. Then, Napoleon co-opted
              Snowball's energy-producing idea of a windmill as his own. The
              pigs would supervise the exhausting work to be conducted by all
              the other lower animals from dawn to dusk. Napoleon (and other
              pigs) were discovered sleeping in the beds in the farmhouse by
              Boxer and Benjamin, and a revised law appeared: &quot;No
            Animal Shall Sleep in a Bed <i>With Sheets.</i>&quot; After establishing
            trade in town with Mr. Whymper, Napoleon conducted a 'show trial'
              (a Stalinist purge) for  alleged, convicted traitors who didn't
            want their eggs confiscated (the hens, plus a sheep and a duck),
            who were forced to confess to their crimes (and charged with being &quot;in
            league with Jones and Snowball&quot;) before they were executed by
            his pack of dogs (off-screen). Another commandment was amended (with
            the blood of the dead): &quot;No Animal Shall Kill Another Animal <i>Without
            Cause.</i>&quot;  The dictatorial Napoleon announced that
              the revolution was over and complete, and should be forgotten -
              and therefore the animals' revolutionary song was banned &quot;under
              penalty of death.&quot; An attack on Animal Farm by Jones and other
              envious farmers was repelled by Napoleon's dogs, but many animals
              lay dead, and Boxer had been shot in the right leg. Over the next
              few years, the windmill was painstakingly rebuilt by the work animals
              led by the exhausted Boxer and Benjamin, as the gluttonous, autocratic
              Napoleon grew more and more obese in the farmhouse, and produced
              many lazy offspring.  The exhausted and elderly Boxer was seriously
              wounded by a heavy block of rock that fell onto him during the
              windmill's re-construction. Napoleon and Squealer privately sold
              Boxer to Mr. Whymper's glue factory. When Boxer was taken away
              in a strange truck (not a veterinarian's vehicle or ambulance),
              the suspicious Benjamin protested and raced after the &quot;death
              wagon,&quot; but failed to stop Boxer's slaughter. After drinking
              from a case of whiskey (payment for Boxer), another law had to
              be modified on the barn's wall: &quot;No Animal Shall Drink 
			  Alcohol<i> to Excess.</i>&quot; As the film
              was concluding, more years went by and the windmill was completed,
              but the ascendant, thriving pigs still had unquestioned power over
              all the other animals whose lives had not improved.  The pigs began
              to walk upright, dress in human clothing, drink whiskey, and treat
              the lower animals as slaves. 'Animal Farm'
            became a showplace for delegations of pigs that arrived to celebrate
            &quot;the new era&quot; and emulate its success. The animal leader
            Benjamin protested loudly that there was now only one law on the
            side of the barn, a modified Commandment: &quot;All Animals Are Equal <i>but
            Some Animals Are More Equal than Others</i>&quot;; Benjamin envisioned
            that the pigs had become like their original human oppressor, Mr.
            Jones.  The animals knew that they must unite and gather
            at Animal Farm from all directions, and must
            rise up and revolt against their false utopian world. The film concluded
            with Benjamin leading an uprising. The lower farm animals vindictively
            marched on the Jones' farmhouse, broke through barriers, smashed
            Napoleon's portrait, and trampled Napoleon and his pig cohorts to
            death before reclaiming the farm and overthrowing the autocracy.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Barefoot Contessa (1954, US/It.)</strong>,
              128 minutes, D: Joseph L. Mankiewicz<br />
              Writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's cautionary showbiz melodrama
              and cynical depiction of Hollywood (conveyed through a rich script),
              with gorgeous Technicolored cinematography by Jack Cardiff,  
              was his first film for his own independent production company Figaro,
              Inc. - financially backed by United Artists. It told a &quot;Cinderella
              tale&quot; about the tragic life of the fictional title character
          - a Spanish sex symbol. The misogynistic and depressing film pushed
          the boundaries of the Production Code, with its themes of an independent
          female destroyed by stardom, unfaithful sex leading to pregnancy, and
          her punishment by an insecure and impotent male. The structure of the
          film was composed of many flashbacks (with voice-over narration provided
          by three main male characters) reaching back to three years earlier
          and providing different perspectives (similar to <a href="citi.html"><i>Citizen
          Kane (1941)</i></a> and <i>Rashomon (1950, Jp.)</i>), to survey the
          short life and loves of Maria Vargas (Ava Gardner) (aka film star Maria
          D'Amata). She was noted for being a flamenco dancer who was often  &quot;barefoot.&quot;
           In the tragic rags-to-riches story, the peasant-born Maria was 'discovered',
          became a movie star, and rose from poverty to become Italian Countess
          Torlato-Favrini. The opening introductory voice-over narration occurred
              at Maria's rain-soaked funeral on the Italian Riviera, delivered
              by washed-up, world-weary, recovering alcoholic and has-been American
          writer/director Harry Dawes (Humphrey Bogart).  The hang-dog character
          spoke about the mythic title character. In the first flashback set
          in a crowded Madrid cabaret-nightclub before a hypnotized audience,
          little-known Maria Vargas performed a flamenco dance (off-screen).
           The film's three main characters were introduced in the nightclub,
          scouting for a possible glamorous actress for their future movie production.
          They had just missed Maria's sole dance performance for the night:
          movie tycoon-producer (similar to Howard Hughes) and &quot;Wall Street
          wizard&quot; Kirk Edwards (Warren Stevens), Dawes (who had been hired
          to write and direct Edwards' first film production), and Edwards' heavily-sweating,
          slimy press agent - Hollywood studio and PR man Oscar Muldoon (Oscar-winning
          Edmond O'Brien) - the three were interested in enticing Maria (as a &quot;new
          face&quot;) to appear in Edwards' first movie production: <i>Black
          Dawn. </i>Backstage in her dressing room and later at her humble family's
          home, Dawes enticed Maria to audition for a 'screen test' in Rome - 
		  to be a star in his next movie. Assured that
          Dawes would be her platonic and protective mentor, Maria agreed to
          the screen test and easily passed. Muldoon remembered how she
              had attended the US premiere of her first film - <i> </i>
          unescorted - unlike most starlets. Maria's first film was a major hit
          and she emerged as a huge international movie star. PR publicist Muldoon
           became worried about negative PR and box-office losses when Maria
              chose to fly from Hollywood to Spain to appear in court to passionately
               defend her infirm father (Renato Chiantoni) who
              had been accused of murdering (by strangulation) her abusive mother
              (Maria Zanoli). His fears were unfounded - her raw testimony in
          court made her an even bigger and more popular star. Two years later during Edwards'
          hosted party in her rented Hollywood home, Maria fell for one
              of Edwards' invited guests - rich millionaire and Latin American
          playboy Alberto Bravano (Marius Goring). She had become restless in Hollywood after making three films with
            Harry and her bankrolling producer Edwards; Maria
          considered herself to now have a 'Cinderella' life,  but there was
          no Prince in her life. Against Harry's advice, Maria  followed
          Alberto back to Madrid, and   joined his international jet-setters
          to cruise  on his white yacht on the French Riviera. The opportunistic
          Muldoon told Harry that he had also maneuvered  to switch his
          allegiance away from Edwards after four years of slaving for him, to
          provide public relations for the ultra-rich Alberto overseas. Unfortunately,
          Maria's pairing with Bravano remained shallow and not fully satisfying:
           (&quot;She showed no pain, no pleasure, no interest. No nothing&quot;).
          And then one night in a luxurious French Riviera casino, the &quot;half-crazy&quot; Alberto
          embarrassingly and abusively accused Maria of stealing from him, causing
          him bad luck and putting a &quot;curse&quot; on him. She was rescued by wealthy Italian Count
          Vincenzo Torlato-Favrini (Rossano Brazzi), who had earlier in the day
          seen Maria in the open outdoors of an olive grove in a French gypsy camp on the border with Italy, as
          she performed a flamenco dance. With her happy permission, the Count
          drove Maria to his magnificent Italian palazzo villa in Rapallo, where
          he introduced her to his widowed sister Eleanora (Valentina Cortese).
          Later during a private and cryptic conversation, Eleanora told Vincenzo
          that she objected to her brother's plans for a wedding to Maria and
          told him that he was being unfair, and &quot;senselessly cruel and
          destructive&quot; to her. After a six-week courtship, the two were married. About three
          months later in Italy in Harry's hotel room, a week before her death,
          Maria visited with Harry and told him (visualized in a brief flashback)
          the devastating details of her wedding night. The Count had informed
          her that he was impotent (the result of a severe WWII wound-injury in 1942) and could not
          provide her with offspring. Maria told the incredulous Harry that she was planning to inform Vincenzo
          the next day that to satisfy herself - and also to please him, she
          had taken it upon herself to continue his family's blood line - and
          had already become pregnant (with the villa's chauffeur). Afterwards,
          Harry was unable to prevent a tragic murder sequence from occurring,
          as he raced after Maria to the villa. The jealous and suspicious Count
          assumed  that she was having an affair with the chauffeur and didn't realize that Maria had already become
          pregnant and wanted to give him a child fathered by someone else. Before
          she was able to explain herself, Vincenzo killed both of them with
          two gun shots (off-screen), and then summoned the police. The film
          concluded with mourners departing at the end of the funeral (as the
          rain stopped); the sun shone on the previously rain-drenched stone
          statue of the barefoot Maria (as a marker for her grave in the villa's
          garden). </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Edward Dmytryk<br />
          Director Edward Dmytryk's war-time military drama was based upon Herman
          Wouk's best-selling and Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <i>The Caine Mutiny</i> published
          in 1951. In the plot, young and inexperienced
          Princeton graduate Ensign Willie Keith (Robert Francis) told how he
          was assigned to a dilapidated and rusty destroyer-minesweeper named
          the <i>USS Caine</i>, newly appointed and captained by stern disciplinarian
          Lt. Commander Francis Philip Queeg (Oscar-nominated Humphrey Bogart).
          Queeg reprimanded the crew for messy shirttails, haircuts, and other
          petty things, and soon it was apparent he might be paranoid, irrational,
          eccentric, and mentally unbalanced - possibly due to long and arduous
          combat duty. The Captain began to demonstrate how disturbed he was,
          especially during a beach-landing incident in which he was dubbed &quot;Old
            Yellowstain&quot; (named after  the yellow dye marker used to indicate
            the landing zone) for his alleged cowardice. The question arose:
          Could the naval officers take control of the ship, without being accused
          of mutiny? The last straw was Queeg's incompetence and mis-treatment
          of a minor incident involving the disappearance of a quart of leftover
          strawberries in the officer's mess, and when Queeg mismanaged the course
          of the ship during a typhoon and executive officer Lt. Steve Maryk
          (Van Johnson) stepped in and took charge. Steve Maryk and Willie Keith
          were court-martialed for mutiny, to be defended by counselor Lt. Barney
          Greenwald (Jose Ferrer). Cynical novelist and communications officer
          Lt. Tom Keefer (Fred MacMurray) testified that taking the ship from
          Queeg was in error, to save himself. The
          prosecution's case faltered when Queeg was cross-examined,
          and he became agitated, frantic, anxious, and paranoid, and blamed
          everyone for the <i>Caine's</i> problems,
          while nervously rolling  clanking steel balls in his hand - a habit
          that he had developed. He also rambled on to defend himself - displaying
          his obviously unbalanced nature. The two officers were acquitted, and
          afterwards during a celebration of their case,  a drunken Lt. Greenwald
          Barney argued that the officers should have supported Queeg, and then
          accused Lt. Keefer of being the true instigator and mutineer of the <i>Caine</i>. </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Carmen Jones (1954)</strong>, 105 minutes,
              D: Otto Preminger<br />
              Daring, risk-taking director Otto Preminger's musical film (for
              Fox Studios) of seductive passion, obsession, and murder  was
              remarkable for its all-black cast and its original and exciting
          premise. The basis of the film was Georges Bizet's 1875 opera <em>Carmen</em>, refitted
        for the big screen as a romantic musical, transposing the tale from 19th
        century Spain to the WWII era in the US, with the main cast composed
        of African-Americans who were stationed at a military base. In the film's
        opening, virtuous, hometown sweetheart and girlfriend Cindy
          Lou (Olga James) arrived at a parachute-making plant
        next to an army camp. She was there to meet her fiancee - handsome, honorable
        military Corporal Joe (Harry Belafonte). Within 24 hours, Joe was scheduled
        to leave for officers' flying school, to become a paratrooper trainee
        destined to be a fighter pilot (&quot;fly boy&quot;) to fight in the
        war, and he proposed that he and Cindy Lou get married just before his
        departure. Meanwhile, the free-spirited,<i> femme
        fatale</i> title character Carmen Jones (Oscar-nominated Dorothy Dandridge in a career-defining
        role) was introduced as a carnal, red-hot, free-spirited 
        factory civilian employee. After brawling with a co-worker, she was arrested,
        and Joe's spiteful superior officer Sgt. Brown (Brock Peters)  ordered
        the off-duty soldier to transport Carmen as a military prisoner to a
        civilian judge in Masonville over 50 miles away, to sentence and punish
        her. On their way to Masonville after a series of misadventures, the
        two ended up at the shack of Carmen's grandmother - and the seductive
        Carmen and Joe made love (off-screen). The next morning, however, she
        escaped with a farewell note telling him of her love. Joe was
        subsequently court-martialed, demoted to private, and placed in a stockade.
         Cindy Lou visited Joe a few weeks later when a package
        was delivered to him from Carmen - containing another love note and a
        cut rose-flower. Disgusted, Cindy Lou departed. While awaiting Joe's
        release, Carmen hung out for him at Billy Pastor's Cafe in Louisiana.
        Once wealthy Chicago heavyweight prize-fighter Husky Miller (Joe Adams)
        saw Carmen at the Cafe, he desired her, and bribed Carmen's friends Frankie
        (Pearl Bailey) and Myrt (Diahann Carroll) to also entice the very reluctant
        Carmen to join them on the train to Chicago. She refused, and then Joe
        suddenly arrived at the Cafe, but he told Carmen that he had to get back
        to the base to take a bus and report for attendance at flying school
        400 miles away. To spite Joe, Carmen decided to accept an offer to accompany
        Joe's superior officer Sgt. Brown for the evening, inciting Joe's angry
        and jealous lust. After a fistfight with Brown who was  &quot;hurt real
        bad,&quot; Carmen suggested that Joe
        desert his regiment and go AWOL to avoid detainment by the MPs (military
        police) and an inevitable 4-year jail term. The two ended up on Husky's
         train to Chicago.  Once there, Joe was forced to seclude
          himself and hide out with Carmen from MP's in a shabby
          rented Chicago apartment, while she was free to come and go. 
		  Once their money started to dry up, Carmen
        was eventually enticed by her friend Frankie to join her at Husky's luxury
        hotel suite, and live a better life. It marked the declining end of their
        ill-fated affair when Carmen tired of Joe and deserted him. She chose
        to become romantically-involved with Husky, who offered her clothes
        and diamonds and material comforts. While the MPs closed in on
        him, Joe located Carmen at Husky's training facility and ordered Carmen
        to leave with him. After he called her &quot;a double-crossin' tramp,&quot; she refused to join him, and
        he was forced to flee when two MPs approached. The film's tragic conclusion
        was set at an arena where Husky defeated his opponent in the ring in
        two rounds. In the audience, Joe - in a jealous rage - grabbed Carmen
        from the arena's crowd and pushed her into a store room. He begged for
        her to return to him, but she rebuffed him and claimed that what they
        had was over and there was no going back for them. Joe gave her the option
        of death or freedom: (&quot;I'll have no man laugh at me while you're
        rollin' around in his arms. Stay with me, or I'll kill you&quot;), and
        she decided: &quot;OK, kill me now, or let me go.&quot; He chose to strangle her to
        death. After murdering her, the MPs arrived to arrest Joe. </font></p></td>

        Lovers, or A Chikamatsu Story)</b>, 102 minutes, D: Kenji Mizoguchi</font><br />
          <font size="2">Director Mizoguchi's romantic drama, based on a 1715
          Japanese puppet theatre play (<i>bunraka</i> or <i>jurori</i>), was
          a passionate tale of star-crossed lovers involved in a forbidden adulterous
          love affair that also involved financial scandal, jealousy and rigid
          feudal duties, roles, and social norms. The film opened in feudal Japan
          in 1693 in Kyoto, at the scroll-making, printing factory of wealthy
          miserly, but reputable older nobleman Ishun (Eitaro Shindo). His business
          included an exclusive contract for the Royal Palace's calendars, and
          he was nervous about any scandal or gossip in the business community
          that would ruin his prosperity. Meanwhile, Ishun's younger wife Osan
          (Kyoko Kagawa) was approached by her indebted brother Gifuya D&ocirc;ki
          (Haruo Tanaka) for a monetary loan of five <i>kan</i> (five gold coins,
          a very small amount). To prevent scandal regarding her family's finances,
          Osan was too embarrassed to ask her stingy husband  for the money.
          Meanwhile, Ishun was pressuring his young maid Otama (Y&ocirc;ko Minamida)
          to be his mistress by sexually advancing on her, when he would periodically
          visit her room to ply her with promises of wealth. Otama
        claimed, deceptively to avoid him, that she was &quot;engaged and getting
        married&quot; to Mohei (Kazuo Hasegawa), Ishun's top employee and meek trusted apprentice-assistant.
        Otama and Mohei  agreed that telling Osan about her profligate husband's
        infidelity would cause an unwanted scandal and ruin the family's reputation.
        Osan asked a favor of Mohei who took care of her husband's business
        accounts - to acquire the money to pay her brother's debt. Mohei made
        an attempt to steal some of Ishun's money by putting his master's seal
        on a blank monetary payment note. However, he was seen by  greedy head
        clerk Sukeimon (Saka Ozawa) (who asked for half of the amount to keep
        quiet). Mohei decided to come clean and reported directly to Ishun, by
        openly presenting his master with the blank note and requesting a loan.
        Mohei was unjustly accused of wrongdoing, even
        though Otama  claimed that she was the one who had asked Mohei
        to lend her the money (for her old jobless and suicidal samurai
        uncle), and Osan begged her husband to take pity. However, Mohei
        confessed to the fraud-crime. Ishun had finally found his opportunity
        to punish his romantic rival (for Otama's romantic interest): &quot;These
        two are in love and they betrayed me!&quot; - he exclaimed. After being
        intensely humiliated, Mohei was cruelly punished by Ishun and locked
        up in a hatch within a storeroom. Osan came to Otama to apologize (&quot;It
        was all my fault&quot;) and thank her for trying to help shield Mohei from Ishun's anger; she was
        surprised when Otama told her that her husband had been trying to sexually
        abuse her. To catch her husband sneaking into Otama's bedroom,
            Osan took Otama's place for the night. Mohei escaped that evening
          and crept into Otama's dark night chamber to thank her, and was totally
            shocked when in the light,  he realized he was speaking to Osan.
          She explained she was there to catch her cheating husband &quot;red-handed.&quot;
          She blamed herself for Mohei's predicament, before he fled to save
          himself after Sukeimon reported that he saw him speaking to Osan. Due
          to misunderstandings and the chain of events, Ishun  now suspected
          a secret and illicit relationship between his wife Osan and Mohei,
          and accused her of infidelity. Both Osan and Mohei escaped to evade
          police (Mohei had already been accused of stealing Ishun's seal). She
          realized her husband was duplicitous, but unfortunately,  their flight
          actually implicated the two as  adulterous lovers, and Mohei worried: &quot;They're
          going to crucify us.&quot; Adultery was actually punishable by crucifixion.
          There were concerns in many places that if the two were
          found by police, they would be charged as adulterers, and related houses
          would suffer with the loss of &quot;dignity&quot; and assets. The couple
           fled together to the mountainous area around Lake Biwa. In the film's
          most dramatic scene, Osan considered committing suicide
          by having Mohei bind her legs and throw her into Lake Biwa; as he was
            preparing her for death, he confessed his love for her: &quot;I have
            always loved you with all my being&quot;; she responded that what
            he had told her changed things - they truly loved each other and
            must remain alive: &quot;What you just said changed everything...I
          don't want to die anymore. I want to live!&quot; After evading authorities
          for awhile, the two lovers were reunited at her family's home, where
          Osan vowed: &quot;We will never part again.&quot; Again, they fled from Kyoto police, but
          were caught and voluntarily confessed to the crime
          of adultery.  In the film's downbeat conclusion,
          government officials found Ishun guilty of deception: (he had &quot;failed
          to report the crime of adultery pertaining to his wife and employee
          Mohei&quot;); the government punished him by seizing and confiscating
           his property, and banishing him to exile (along with Sukeimon
           for his dishonesty). The two adulterers (holding hands together)
            were paraded through town on horseback on their way to being crucified
        - they were happily holding hands. </font></p>        </td>

            D: Jack Arnold</font><br />
          <font size="2">This classic Universal creature-horror film  by director
          Jack Arnold was originally shot in 3-D, and the last great prototypical
          classic from Universal Studios. The campy film began with a voice-over
          from a narrator (Art Gilmore) reading from the Biblical book of Genesis.
          A startling discovery was made in an upper Amazonian jungle in Brazil
          of a fossilized claw or hand (with webbed fingers) embedded in rock
          by Dr. Carl Maia (Antonio Moren). On his way to   the Institute of
          Maritime Biology at Morajo Bay in Brazil with his amazing fossil find,
          Dr. Maia met with another scientist, ichthyologist Dr. David Reed (Richard
          Carlson), who was studying specimens of lung-fish. Reed was one of
          Dr. Maia's previous students. He was accompanied by his dark-haired
          girlfriend-fiancee and research colleague Kay Lawrence (Julia Adams).
          Back in the Amazon jungle campsite, Dr. Maia's two local assistants,
          Tomas (Perry Lopez) and Luis (Rodd Redwing), were suddenly attacked
          by a humanoid creature (seen with a disembodied claw). An
          anthropological expeditionary group was quickly organized by Dr. Maia
          and funded by Reed's boss Dr. Mark Williams (Richard Denning), to journey
          back on the  Brazilian river into the Amazon on board the dilapidated <i>Rita. </i>Once
          the group arrived at Dr. Maia's campsite, they discovered the destroyed
          campsite and the two dead assistants. It was
          eventually discovered that a prehistoric web-fingered Gill-Man (Ben
          Chapman) could be found in a dark unexplored lagoon downstream
          known as the &quot;Black Lagoon.&quot; As the scuba-diving Reed and Williams gathered rock samples
          underwater, they were unaware that they were being stalked and watched
          by the Gill-Man. In a scary and superbly-photographed underwater
          sequence, the creature expressed 'Beauty-and-the-Beast' love interest
          in bathing beauty Kay, stalking and watching her from below as she
          swam above him in a white one-piece suit. After
          some deadly encounters with the aggressive Gill-Man, and two more crew
          members were killed and scientist
          Dr. Edwin Thompson (Whit Bissell) was seriously wounded, the group
          was compelled to depart, but discovered that the Creature had deliberately
          blockaded their exit from the Black Lagoon. Underwater, as Reed tried
          to clear the blocked passage a second time, Williams approached with
          the spear-gun and hit the Gill-Man in the abdomen. Reed watched
          from nearby as the Creature dragged Williams down and mauled him to
          death. The Creature was also able
          to climb on board and reach in through a porthole in an attempt to
          attack the bandaged and ailing Dr. Thompson.  As the crew was then
          distracted while working to clear the blockade, suddenly, Kay was grabbed
          and kidnapped from the boat. The Creature dove back into the water
          with her and took her to its swampy cave or grotto hidden by the bank.
          Dr. Reed with a spear-gun came to Kay's rescue. As the Creature was
          attacking Dr. Reed and Kay was cowering nearby, it was shot with bullets
          (by Dr. Maia and Captain Lucas) and severely injured in the chest with
          multiple bullet wounds. Dr. Reed allowed the Creature to retreat back
          to the lagoon's beach (&quot;Let him go&quot;) where it swam off, disappeared,
          and sank lifelessly back into the deep watery depths of the lagoon.</font></p>        </td>

                  (1954)</a>, </b>105 minutes, D:
              Alfred Hitchcock<br />
              This was Hitchcock's screen version of English playwright Frederick
              Knott's successful stage play. It was filmed in 3-D with the technology
              that was available at the time, and judged as one of the greatest
              3D films ever made. [Note: It was remade as <i>A Perfect Murder
              (1998).</i>] Hitchcock's crime-thriller and mystery masterpiece
              told about a charming, sophisticated yet villainous husband - an
              ex-tennis pro named Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), who masterminded
              the murder of his unfaithful wealthy socialite wife Margot Wendice
              (Grace Kelly) for having an affair with American crime-mystery
              writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), so that he could inherit
              her fortune. Wendice blackmailed or &quot;influenced&quot; C.A.
              Swann/Captain Lesgate (Anthony Dawson), a former classmate with
              a petty-criminal record, to commit her &quot;perfect
              murder&quot; for &pound;1,000 pounds cash. During the attempted
              strangulation scene, the tension was ratcheted up. Tony's plan
              was to have his wife leave her bedroom to answer the living room
              phone, to enable Swann to strangle her from behind the drawn window
              curtains where he was hiding. In one of the most suspenseful scenes,
              Tony dialed his home number (dialing M for murder) from a hotel
              lobby's payphone, but because his watch had unexpectedly stopped,
              he was about eight minutes too late. Tension was intensified and
              his plan was botched because he was planning to call at 11:00 pm,
              but the call was at about 11:08 pm. The assassin was frazzled and
              about to leave because of the delay. When the phone finally rang,
              the camera slowly panned to the left around Margot as she came
              into the living room and answered. The camera moved to view Swann's
              position behind the living room curtains. He approached with a
              twisted scarf and wrapped it around her neck, but she foiled his
              strong attack by fighting back. She reached behind her - searching
              for a weapon (a pair of scissors) to defend herself and then killed
              the assassin by stabbing him in the back. Tony's new plan to outwit
              the police seemed to succeed - making it appear that Margot had
              an ulterior motive for killing Swann (he made it appear that Swann
              was blackmailing her), and she was rapidly brought to trial and
              convicted. However, there were anomalies in Tony's story that didn't
              add up (mixed up keys, switched raincoats, etc.), and wily Inspector
              Hubbard (John Williams) was on the case. His objective
              was to prove Margot's innocence and establish Tony's guilt. During
              much of the second half of the film, Mark theorized or speculated
              with Tony about what actually happened to save Margot's life, and
              in fact, his theory was extremely close to the truth - that Tony
              had paid Swann to kill his wife Margot. Tony blamed Margot for
              an attache case with 'blackmail' money to pay off Swann, but she
              claimed she knew nothing about it. In the concluding scene, Hubbard
              had set up a trap for Tony after he found that Tony had hidden
              Margot's stolen front-door key in the hallway - and it was still
              there; he showed the key to the astonished Mark and Margot. The
              guilty Tony opened the door with the crucial duplicate latchkey
              (using Margot's front-door key that he had stolen from her handbag,
              and then planted for Swann's use) that Swann had earlier retrieved
              from under the carpet on the 5th step of the stairs outside the
              apartment. That was the reason why there was no key  found
              on the dead assassin Swann (and there was no forced entry either,
              because he didn't have mud on his shoes) - Swann had entered using
              the planted key and immediately replaced it under the stairs' rug.
              When Tony entered (using the key under the carpet stairs) and turned,
              he realized that he had been found out: (The Inspector predicted
              Tony's downfall: &quot;Once he opens that door, we shall know everything&quot;). As the lights
          went on inside the apartment (symbolic of his revealed crime), he turned
          and found himself face-to-face with the Inspector, Margot and Mark
          waiting inside. With restrained British reserve, Tony congratulated
          the Inspector for solving the case.</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Far Country (1954)</b>, 97 minutes, D: Anthony
            Mann<br />
            This dark revenge western was the fourth pairing of
            director Anthony Mann with actor James Stewart, in films between
            1950 and 1955. The script was written by Borden Chase. It was filmed
            in Technicolor in the Great Canadian Northwest. The setting
            was In 1896, during a cattle drive into the 'far country,' from Wyoming
            to Seattle, and then to the port city of Scagway (in the Alaskan
            Panhandle), and further northward into Canada to Dawson City (in
            the Canadian territory of the Yukon). During the Klondike Gold Rush,
            self-reliant, misanthropic anti-hero cattle herder and loner Jeff
            Webster (James Stewart) (advertised as a &quot;stranger
            with a gun&quot;) and his trusted, grizzly sidekick pal Ben Tatum
            (Walter Brennan) were herding their cattle from Wyoming, with Ben's
            ultimate objective to fund their dream ranch in Utah. The film opened
            in the coastal city of Seattle, where Webster directed his cattle
            onto a steamship bound to the North, after being accused by two cowhands
            of unlawfully murdering two other cattle thieves. Upon their arrival
            in Scagway, the two interrupted a hanging on a platform erected in
            the town's streets, being conducted by the film's
            despotic antagonist: wealthy yet affable top-hatted
            judge/Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire). The self-appointed Gannon arrested
            Webster on false charges, and then held a bogus and unfair trial
             in the saloon of seductress Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman), who was one
            of Gannon's corrupt business associates. (The seductress had earlier
            helped shelter Jeff from authorities onboard the steamship in
            her stateroom's bed, and she had taken  a liking to him.) The
            annoyed and tyrannical judge, who was quoted as saying: &quot;I'm
            gonna like you. I'm gonna hang you but I'm gonna like
            you,&quot; acquitted
              Jeff of the murder of two cattle thieves, but then confiscated
            Webster's entire herd for the crime of disturbing the peace in town.
            However, within a short time, Webster and Tatum were hired by Ronda
            to lead a caravan to the lawless, isolated, gold-rush settlement
            town of Dawson City. During their first night, their ploy to steal
            back their herd of animals succeeded, and they were able to find
            refuge outside of Gannon's jurisdiction across the border in Canada.
            After reacquiring his herd, Jeff was threatened by the perturbed
            scoundrel Gannon that he would be hanged if he ever returned south
            thru Skagway. During their further trek northward, Jeff insised on
            taking a diversionary valley trail with his cattle, while he watched
            Ronda and the others take a faster, more treacherous mountainous
            2-Mille Pass trail prone to avalanche - without warning her. After
            begrudgingly being forced to rescue her, the caravan finally arrived
            in Dawson City, Yukon, featuring a local hash house with bear stew,
            a school and a community church. To his greedy surprise, Jeff was
            able to auction off his herd for a high bid of $40,000. The surprising
            highest bidder was Ronda, who outbid the lower offer of the co-owners
            of the hash house. As a new arrival in town, the savvy, strong-willed
            entrepreneur was opening up a saloon known as Dawson Castle, in partnership
            with Gannon, that would inevitably usher in more lawlessness and
            greedy corruption. With her advantages of endless cash and beef,
            the self-interested Ronda would become the new overlord of the town.
            Jeff was determined to resist the amorous, love-triangle intentions
            of both 'bad girl' Ronda and a pigtailed, tomboyish, freckly-faced
            French-Canadian immigrant named Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). He
            also urged the townsfolk to avoid conflict and withdraw from interfering,
            rather than opposing Gannon and his henchmen. With their cash, Jeff
            and Tatum bought an existing gold mine claim, and were planning to
            evade Gannon and his hired men and leave town, but Tatum inadvertently
            and foolishly tipped them off (by buying extra coffee for the long
            trip). As the two men were by their river escape route by raft, they
            were attacked and robbed - Tatum was shot dead while Jeff's right
            hand was hit and incapacitated. After returning to Dawson where he
            was cared for by Renee, he now chose to participate in an inevitable
            shoot-out between himself and the villainous Gannon and his lawless
            men. Jeff's tiny bell on his horse Pie's saddle-horn announced his
            arrival for a showdown. He held his Winchester rifle across his injured
            arm with his left hand, to take a stand with the community's residents
            (intimidated, powerless and persecuted miners) against the cheating
            Gannon and his gang led by Madden (Robert J. Wilke) and Newberry
            (Jack Elam). Jeff evaded a surprise ambush by the two henchmen, but
            as Ronda ran out into the street to warn him, she was lethally shot
            in the back by Gannon. Jeff fired back at Gannon under the saloon's
            porch floorboards and killed him. He was supported by the armed and
            courageous townfolk, to take back their city. </font></p>        </td>

            (1954, Jp.) (aka Godzilla)</b>, 96 minutes,
            D: Ishir&ocirc; Honda<br />
            The influential classic Japanese horror film, with effective special
            effects, was later released in 1956 as a shortened, re-edited Americanized
            version (with Raymond Burr as US reporter Steve Martin). The film
            served as an allegory for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki attacks almost
            10 years earlier. In the original 1954 Japanese film, Godzilla was
            a dormant (but revived) giant, fire-breathing, dinosaur-like, reptilian
            monster/creature. It had been awakened, irradiated and mutated by
            atomic H-Bomb tests in the ocean, revealed when ocean waters turned
            boiling hot. In the area near Odo Island, two mysterious,
            devastating explosions (signaled by a flash of light) and boiling
            water destroyed two Japanese freighters. A fishing boat that rescued
            some survivors also sank. A superstitious,
          villager-inhabitant elder blamed everything on the ancient legend
          of a creature named Godzilla (&quot;I knew it. It must be Godzilla&quot;)
          - an enormous, destructive and ancient sea creature. The
        devastated residents of Odo Island, after the destruction of their fishing
          industry, demanded disaster relief in Tokyo. Paleontologist Professor
          Kyohei Yamane (Takashi Shimura) ordered  an emergency research
          team to the island to immediately investigate; a research vessel was
          quickly dispatched (including Yamane with his daughter Emiko (Momoko
          K&#333;chi) and her new fiancee, South Seas Salvage ship captain Hideto
          Ogata (Akira Takarada) on board). On the island, traces of radioactivity
          were discovered, plus  the presence of a giant ancient
          dinosaur (with radioactive footprints) was hypothesized. The monstrous
          Godzilla was briefly sighted - Yamane called it  &quot;a creature from
          the Jurassic era&quot; that was emitting high levels of H-bomb radiation. He
          theorized that Godzilla had appeared in Japan's territorial waters
          only after being awakened in its sea cave &quot;sanctuary&quot; by
          repeated underwater H-bomb testing in the Pacific region.  Dr.
          Yamane was more interested in studying, understanding and researching
          Godzilla (and understanding its resistance to radiation) rather than
          killing him - and actually admitted that Godzilla was invincible. It
          was rumored that Dr. Daisuke Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata), a reclusive
          colleague of Emiko's father, and Emiko's ex-fiancee, was working on
          a Godzilla-related secret project (&quot;a
          major breakthrough in defeating Godzilla&quot;) at his research laboratory.
          He privately demonstrated his secret weapon to Emiko that he had devised
          to destroy Godzilla - but only if she promised to keep quiet: (&quot;you
          mustn't tell a soul&quot;). She was horrified
          by what she saw (OFFSCREEN, a tank full of fish were turned to skeletons
          in mere seconds) - she covered her eyes, and screamed.  The
          beast further rampaged through mid-50s Tokyo Bay and then the ward-city
          of Shinagawa. A barbed-wire security barrier
          (100 feet high and 165 feet deep) was constructed along the entire
          Tokyo-Yokahama coast and then electrified with 50,000 volts, but it
          proved ineffective when Godzilla continued
            to ravage the city of Tokyo by producing huge fires and &quot;a sea
          of flames&quot; everywhere, before retreating back to the ocean. During
          a flashback sequence, Emiko divulged to her
          fiancee Ogata what she had actually seen in Dr. Serizawa's laboratory.
          He had developed a device known as an &quot;Oxygen Destroyer&quot; that
          sucked all the oxygen from an aquarium water tank filled with fish,
          asphyxiating and then liquefying the living creatures instantly. In
          the flashback, Serizawa explained to Emiko how he was reluctant to
          use the device against the <i>kaiju</i>,
          knowing that its potential power could destroy all of mankind. After
          the flashback ended, Ogata and Emiko approached and confronted the
          scientist, begging him to save humanity. Serizawa decided that he must
          destroy his research documents and lab notes-materials in order to
          prevent the Oxygen Destroyer from getting into the wrong hands, but
          he still feared that he had knowledge of the device's construction
          in his head. After he agreed to use the superweapon, a naval ship transported
          Ogata and Serizawa near to Godzilla's last known location, using a
          radiation Geiger counter. The device was taken 
          into Tokyo Bay on a naval ship.  Ogata and Serizawa wore diving
          suits to plant the Oxygen Destroyer deep into the water. Ogata surfaced
          as Godzilla approached, when Serizawa unexpectedly decided to deliberately sacrifice
          himself (to save humanity from further destruction if the horrible
          weapon's plans were revealed to the world's superpowers). Alone, he
          released and detonated his device underwater and cut his own diving
          suit's air-hose - killing both Godzilla and himself. The film concluded
          with Dr. Yamane's cautionary final statement of his worries on the
          deck: &quot;I can't believe that Godzilla was the last of his species. If nuclear
          testing continues, then someday, somewhere in the world, another Godzilla
          may appear.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Human Desire (1954)</strong> <b>(aka The
        Human Beast)</b>, 91 minutes, D: Fritz Lang<br />
        Fritz Lang's grim, noirish, melodramatic tale of fate, infidelity, blackmail
        and obsessive passion was based on Emile Zola's 1890 novel <i>La Bete
        Humaine</i>. This remake was already filmed twice before: the silent
        film<i> Die Bestie
        im Menschen (1920, Germ.)</i> and Jean Renoir's French film <i>La B&ecirc;te
        Humaine (1938, Fr.) (aka The Human Beast)</i>. After
        three years of service, returning Korean War veteran and train engineer
        Jeff Warren (Glenn Ford) was beginning to adjust to life on the homefront
          and work in New Jersey for the railroad. Jeff was introduced on the
        job to the assistant railway yardmaster Carl Buckley (Broderick Crawford)
        - he was a violence-prone, moody, brutish, abusively sloppy drunk
            and depressed older man. Carl had recently married a trophy wife
            - no-good <i>femme fatale</i> Vicki Buckley (Gloria Grahame), an
            amoral, erotic, brassy, manipulative and sexually-frustrated, unloved
          wife (described in the film's tagline as: &quot;She
          was born to be bad...to be kissed...to make trouble!&quot;). Due to
          his quick anger, Carl was fired from his job for his insubordination
          toward his boss John Thurston (Carl Lee). He pressured his wife Vicki
          to intervene with powerful John Owens (Grandon Hughes), her mother's
          former boss and a childhood acquaintance, to restore his job. Owens
          was an influential and powerful businessman who
          conducted alot of shipping business with the railroad. In NYC, Vicki
          met with Owens over a period of five hours, and the brutish and jealous
          Carl suspected that she had slept with him 
          in exchange for favors. The black-hearted, vengeful Carl forced Vicki
          to confess to adulterous infidelity, and pressured her to hand-write
          an intimate message to Owens who was due to take the night train to
          Chicago. Vicki requested another rendezvous-meeting with Owens that
          evening in his sleeping car train compartment. It was part of Carl's
          devious plan to stalk and then murder Owens with a knife in the train
          compartment. The murder occurred off-screen behind the compartment's
          door. The crime scene was made to look like a robbery had been committed;
          Carl took Owens' wallet and his pocket-watch - and he also removed
          Vicki's incriminating message. On the same train during the murder,
          the off-duty Jeff witnessed that Vicki was present at the murder scene,
          and he became inextricably involved in the crime. Carl had instructed
            Vicki to distractedly seduce Jeff so that Carl could escape unnoticed.
          Later, Carl blackmailed Vicki when he  threatened to take the message
          to the police if Vicki accused him of the lethal stabbing. Jeff was
          immediately attracted to Vicki when she followed Carl's orders inside
           Jeff's compartment. Afterwards, Carl refused to burn the message:
           (&quot;This letter is gonna keep us together. There's not gonna be anybody else,
          Vicki&quot;). During the subsequent trial, Jeff protectively avoided
          identifying Vicki as the passenger he saw near Owens' compartment.
          Soon, Vicki was confessing to Jeff how her abusive marriage was crumbling
          and together, they entered into a passionate adulterous affair. Jeff
          knew he was getting embroiled into something dangerous that could
          incriminate him  as an accomplice to the crime. Vicki again lied to
          Jeff and told him that her alleged affair with Owens didn't happen,
          even though she told him that under pressure when beaten by Carl, she
          had blurted out that it was true. Jeff's  libidinous
          desire for her led him to try
          to work things out with Vicki. When Carl was again fired from his job,
          Vicki told Jeff about her newest predicament, and planted a murderous
          seed in Jeff's head, suggesting that Carl might have an accident in
          the yard, to prevent Carl from continuing to threaten blackmail toward
          her. That evening, Jeff was tempted to nearly kill her violence-prone,
          drunken, and unstable husband, but then he relented and failed to carry
          through on murder, but he was able to take the letter from Carl's pocket.
          Jeff accused Vicki of playing him for a fool, making him lie on the
          stand, and then deceiving him and setting him up as Carl's murderer.
          Jeff decided to end their affair and reject her (&quot;It is finished&quot;)
           - he felt completely manipulated and used - and gave up on her, but
          before leaving, he gave her the black-mail message. In the
          film's doom-laden, deadly conclusion, as the jilted Vicki was riding
          on Jeff's train to leave town, Carl entered her compartment and begged
          her to not desert him; he also offered to give her back the message
          - but she snapped back that he couldn't bargain with her because the
          letter was no longer in his possession. Carl accused her of infidelity
          with Jeff, but she claimed she was leaving on her own. She
          taunted him by admitting her affair with Jeff and that she had enjoyed
          seducing Owens  to reacquire Carl's job. Insanely jealous,
          Carl then strangled Vicki to death.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Johnny Guitar (1954),</b> 110 minutes, D: Nicholas
              Ray<br />
              Nicholas Ray's off-beat Western and bizarre psychological film
              for Republic Pictures was often called a 'lesbian western' (with
              major role-reversals) and a visually-excessive melodrama. In the
              1800s, gun-crazed drifter and reformed gunslinger Johnny  &quot;Guitar&quot; Logan
              (Sterling Hayden) with a guitar strung over his shoulder, arrived
              in a small Arizona cattle town and entered into Vienna's - a deserted
              gambling saloon. Its owner was non-conformist, strong-willed 
        Vienna (Joan Crawford) who had built the saloon on the outskirts
              of town in lucrative anticipation of the transcontinental railroad
        coming through with a station nearby. A recent stagecoach robbery brought
              a group of intolerant 'good guy' vigilantes (composed mostly of
        cattle ranchers) to the saloon to confront Vienna. They were led by blood-lusting,
              mean-spirited, sexually-repressed, bull-dyke rancher Emma Small
        (Mercedes McCambridge), whose brother was killed during the robbery.
              Without any proof, the group, including influential and wealthy
              cattle rancher John McIvers (Ward Bond) and Marshal Williams (Frank
              Ferguson) and others, accused Vienna of collusion with the suspected
              gunslinger leader of the gang, the Dancin' Kid (Scott Brady). Part
              of the reason for the group's animosity toward Vienna was because
              they were opposed to the railroad bringing in &quot;dirt
        farmers&quot; and &quot;squatters&quot;
          who would fence off and subdivide the land (with fence posts and barbed
        wire), push out the ranchers, and support her business.  The Marshal
           refused to believe the Dancin' Kid's claim that his gang, at the time
          of the robbery, was mining a secret silver lode, and not breaking
        the law.  McIvers unfairly allowed Vienna only 24 hours
        to close up her casino on the outskirts of town and leave. After the
          group departed,  Johnny promised to remain in town, back
              Vienna up and work for her business - as a guitar player and as
        a gunfighter. They were also interested in rekindling their previous
          romantic relationship from five years earlier. After returning to their
        secret mountain hideout, the Dancin' Kid (who was also interested in
          Vienna) with his 3-member gang decided to move to California, but first
          planned to rob the local bank to finance their trip. At the bank withdrawing
          her funds the next day, Vienna was implicated in the town's bank robbery
          when she suspiciously happened to be inside the bank during
           the heist, although she tried to dissuade the Kid from carrying through
        on the robbery. Emma and her vigilante mob (with McIvers)
          again formed a posse to seize both the Dancin' Kid's
        gang and Vienna and punish them for the crime. The youngest gang member
          - boyish-faced Turkey Ralston (Ben Cooper), was ultimately caught and
          hanged by the posse-mob. Vienna was also seized and about to be hanged,
          but was rescued by Johnny, although she watched as her saloon was burned
          to the ground. Eventually, the two 
        made it to the Dancin' Kid's secret hideaway cabin the next day.  The
          posse found its way to the  cabin through a hidden waterfall
        entry and surrounded it, but stood back and watched as a deadly personal
          vendetta played out between Emma and Vienna. The two women faced off
          with a bloody one-on-one pistol duel on the outer porch of the cabin;
          in the midst of their shoot-out, the Dancin' Kid died from a gunshot
          to the forehead by Emma as he raced up to the cabin. Although Vienna
          was wounded in the right upper arm, she shot and killed Emma who tumbled
        off the porch and rolled down the hill. Johnny helped Vienna to walk
        past the posse, through the waterfall and away for a new life, as Peggy
        Lee sang the title song &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; with the words: &quot;There
        was never a man like my Johnny.&quot;</font></p></td>

                or Voyage to Italy)</b>, 97 or 85 minutes,
          D: Roberto Rossellini<br />
          Roberto Rossellini's evocative romantic drama was an example of Italian
          neo-realism. It explored a reserved but troubled British couple traveling
          in Italy together during a vacation, who were struggling in their 
          marriage. The unhappily-married, wealthy, sophisticated, and childless
          British couple (after eight years of marriage) was driving toward
          Naples, Italy; the two were sensitive-minded Katherine Joyce (Ingrid
          Bergman) and her husband - workaholic, cold-hearted, often-bored, and
          brusque Alexander 'Alex' Joyce (George Sanders). They found themselves
          alone but together for one of the first times in their troubled, uneasy,
          eroding and dissatisfying marriage and fractured relationship. Their
          undivided, transplanted time together in non-familiar and unstructured
          circumstances (unlike their lives in London) magnified their unhappy
          situation and all its strains, and how they didn't really know each
          other. They were in Italy for a short visit to put up for sale a villa
          property on the Gulf of Naples left to Alex through inheritance. The
          rift in their marriage intensified when the neurotic and romantic Katherine
          told Alex a melancholy tale involving a former &quot;pale and spiritual&quot; 
		  acquaintance of hers named Charles Lewington. Alex reacted coldly to
		  her recollected story of lost and unrequited passionate love and called
		  Charles &quot;a fool.&quot; Afterwards, both of them started to follow different
          and independent pursuits - Katherine
          hastily left the villa to drive back to Naples by herself for a day
		  of visiting cultural and historical Neapolitan sites and museums on
		  her own. The often smug, condescending and sarcastic Alex, who sometimes
		  expressed hostility and lashed out at strange customs he encountered,
		  departed to enjoy the socializing and 'company' of past acquaintances
		  on the island of Capri; meanwhile, Katherine visited more sites. Alex
		  visited the island of Capri  to be with other British
		  tourists and womanize with married socialite Marie (Maria Mauban).
		  After a few days when Alex returned on  a boat from Capri to the
		  mainland at 5:00 pm, he picked up an unnamed morbid, depressed and
		  almost-suicidal prostitute (Anna Proclemer) in his car, but soon decided
		  to abandon her and drop her off. Back at the villa the next day,
          Alex chided Katherine for taking the car on another &quot;love pilgrimage&quot; (&quot;another
          ruin immortalized by Charles?&quot;) to the Fontanelle
          catacombs (with rows of skulls); he also meanly criticized
          her: &quot;Everything you do nowadays seems so utterly senseless.&quot; When she called
          him &quot;intolerable,&quot; he suggested that they get a divorce. At a
          crossroads in their relationship and in a pivotal scene together, Alex
          and Katherine  were pressured to visit the ancient ruins and site
          of archaeological excavations of the lava-covered city of Pompeii in
          79 AD. Katherine was shocked by the real-life,
          slow uncovering, reconstructing and unearthing of the disintegrated
          yet preserved remains of two people who died together, and asked to
          leave. As Alex and Katherine drove back through Naples to the villa,
          they were seriously threatening to break up and divorce each other
          when they found themselves engulfed in the midst of a religious processional.
          They abandoned the car and soon became separated within the surge of
          humanity - Katherine felt emotionally alone and desperately called
          out for Alex's help. The two lost individuals began to search for each
          other and found relief and a sense of mutual completeness once they
          found each other, hugged, and were reunited.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b><a href="onth.html">On the Waterfront (1954)</a>,</b> 108
              minutes, D: Elia Kazan<br />
            Best Director-winning Elia Kazan's compelling, evocative, gritty,
            Best Picture-winning drama was about trade union corruption, racketeering
            and violence on the New York waterfront and the struggles of an ex-prize
            fighter, with a symbolic Christian
            martyr theme. Inarticulate, Irish ex-boxer champ Terry Malloy (Oscar-winning
            Marlon Brando), a longshoreman-worker on the docks, was introduced
            as a caretaker for pigeons on the roof of his tenement apartment.
            He helped to set up the murder of a fellow dock worker named Joey
            Doyle - a victim of gangster union boss Johnny Friendly's (Oscar-nominated
            Lee J. Cobb) oppressive hold over the longshoremen. Joey was being
            punished for threatening to 'sing' to the New York State Crime Commission.
             Another dockworker Timothy &quot;Kayo&quot; Dugan (Pat Henning)
             who testified was also deliberately killed on the job. When Terry
             began to fall in love with shy and frail Edie Doyle (Oscar-winning
             Eva Marie Saint), the dead man's grieving and distraught sister,
             his allegiances were challenged. She wanted him to help find out
             the truth about Joey's suspicious death, and she also challenged
             the local parish priest Father Barry (Oscar-nominated Karl Malden)
             to stand up to the corruption of mob rule. Father Barry delivered
             a symbolic and memorable &quot;Sermon on the Docks&quot;  
            in the hold, a speech to commemorate Dugan's death, about the sin
            of keeping silent. As Terry gradually fell
             in love with Edie, he became more and more conflicted about testifying
             against the mob, and about disobeying his crooked, scheming lawyer
             and older brother Charley Malloy (Rod Steiger), who worked for Friendly
            as an accountant. Terry
              made two confessions about his complicit involvement: (1) To Father
              Barry: &quot;I just thought they was gonna lean on him a little
              bit. I never figured they was gonna knock 'em off....You know,
              if I spill, my life ain't worth a nickel&quot;; and (2) To Edie
              - a prolonged blast from a ship's whistle drowned out and accentuated
              his words. She reacted with horror, turned and ran away from him
            and never turned back. The film's most famous
            scene was Terry's  &quot;I coulda been a contender&quot; speech in the back seat of a taxi-cab
            with Charley who  worried that Terry would testify against the
            mob. It was mostly a conversation about Terry's failed career
            as a boxer. Terry chided his brother about not looking out for him
            properly and allowing him to become a failure and a bum, by urging
            him to take a fall in his last fixed fight (&quot;...Whadda
            I get? A one-way ticket to Palookaville....You was my brother, Charley.
            You shoulda looked out for me a little bit. You shoulda taken care
            of me - just a little bit - so I wouldn't have to take them dives
            for the short-end money....You don't understand! I coulda had class.
            I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum,
            which is what I am. Let's face it (pause) ... It was you, Charley&quot;).
             Terry shockingly discovered Charley's corpse
            hanging on a longshoreman's hook in a back alley, illuminated by
            a truck's headlights. He was presumably murdered as a reprisal because
            it was thought he couldn't convince Terry not to testify. After the
            murder, Terry defiantly  testified against
            Friendly to break wide open the case of Joey
            Doyle. He found himself threatened with unemployment, and the murder
            of his pigeons on the rooftop. In  the finale, Terry defiantly
            challenged the work boss and other workers, but found himself shunned
            by the other longshoreman as a &quot;rat&quot; and informer.  Terry
            marched down to the union office-shack (followed by workers-onlookers)
            to personally confront Johnny Friendly and accuse him of murder.
            Terry was beaten unmercifully behind the waterfront shack at the
            pier and nearly killed in a fight to the death. However, he was
            able to rally the longshoremen to his cause against the exploitative
            dock bosses by refusing to lose his union job. He broke
            the strangle-hold power of the union boss when the dockworkers defiantly
            claimed: &quot;He don't work, we don't work.&quot;  The workers, forming
          a line on the side, rallied around their new leader as he led the
          loitering longshoremen back to work through the gate past the shipping
        boss, although he was dizzy and unsteady on his feet. He had convinced
            the others to refuse to work unless he was allowed entry into the
            warehouse. The desperate Friendly was unable to persuade the   
        workers from following Terry as he screamed out: &quot;Where you guys
        going? Wait a minute? I'll remember this! I'll remember every one of
        ya! I'll be back, don't you forget that. I'll be back.&quot; </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
            Hitchcock's  masterpiece of obsessive human curiosity and
            voyeurism was based upon Cornell Woolrich's short story first published
            in 1942, and titled as "It Had
            to Be Murder." It was a suspenseful,
            nail-biting mystery-thriller about a wheelchair-bound, immobilized
              NY magazine photographer who believed he had witnessed a murder
            during his convalescence in a wheelchair. During a  New York summer
            heat wave, bachelor, free-lance photo-journalist L. B. 'Jeff' Jeffries
            (James Stewart) recuperated in his Greenwich Village, NY apartment
            from a broken leg. He wiled away the time by &quot;peeping&quot; and
            observing - and spying on neighbors through his rear window (with
            both binoculars and his long telephoto-lens camera), while being
            cared for by his fashionable, socialite girlfriend-model Lisa Carol
            Fremont (Grace Kelly) and nurse-therapist Stella McCaffery (Thelma
            Ritter). He experienced all of life's extremes through his neighbors
            seen through their framed windows - a honeymooning newly-wed couple
            (Rand Harper and Havis Davenport), shapely blonde exerciser-dancer
            Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy), lonely and suicidal spinster Miss Lonelyhearts
            (Judith Evelyn), a struggling pianist-songwriter (Ross Bagdasarian),
            and an intriguing, bickering couple - a traveling costume jewelry
            salesman Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), and his little-seen invalid
            wife Mrs. Thorwald (Irene Winston). Stella  cautioned Jeff about
            his lack of roots and commitment, his sidestepping of marriage and
            his lukewarm attitude toward Lisa, his fashion-model girlfriend. After
            a late-night suspicious female scream and breaking glass, and views
            of Thorwald making repeated late-night trips carrying a suitcase,
            Jeff persisted with attentive observations and suspicions about Thorwald
            killing his wife, although he was dissuaded by his NYC police detective
            friend Lt. Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey) and Stella to not exaggerate.
            Over time, Lisa became convinced and concluded that Jeff's insane,
            sinister, and imaginative conclusions might be accurate. Jeff
            reported that the salesman wrapped a saw and a butcher knife in
            newspaper, and put a rope around a large trunk. Lisa 
            speculated that Thorwald was involved in an adulterous relationship
            with a female accomplice in the murder of his wife; she became convinced
            of the truth of Thorwald's guilt. There were
              further concerns when an upstairs older couple's (Sara Berner and
              Frank Cady) dog (that was seen digging in the garden) was found
            dead from strangulation in the courtyard, and Jeff
            noticed that the only person who didn't emerge from inside when the
            dog was discovered was Thorwald, seen smoking a glowing cigarette
            in his darkened apartment. To confront
            the possible killer, Jeff had Lisa deliver an anonymous note asking, &quot;What
            have you done with her?&quot; Jeff also daringly
            had Lisa and Stella dig in the garden for evidence (while Thorwald
            was lured away), but when they didn't find anything, Lisa decided
            to enter Thorwald's apartment  to look for the wife's
            wedding ring. In the film's most  suspenseful
            scene, Lisa tensely explored and searched in suspected wife-murderer
            Thorwald's apartment for incriminating evidence just before he returned
            - she was ecstatic when she found an alligator hand-bag, proof of
            Thorwald's guilt - he <i>must</i> have murdered her because, according
            to Lisa, no woman goes on a trip leaving behind her favorite jewelry
            (or handbag). Jeff nervously reacted as he watched powerlessly and
            helplessly from across the courtyard when Lisa was trapped and confronted
            face-to-face in the apartment by Thorwald. Caught, she was assaulted
            but rescued when  the police arrived in the apartment's
            corridor just in time to prevent any serious injury. During questioning,
            to signal that she had found the ring, Lisa pointed to Thorwald's
            wife's wedding ring <i>on her own finger</i> that she waved behind
            her back. Lars noticed her signals and the wedding ring, and
            followed the sight-line  sent by Lisa (behind her back)
            to Jeff in his apartment. He  triangulated the view - and spotted
             the mortal threat. He looked up and discovered that Jeff, his tormentor,
            was watching from the apartment window across the courtyard, looking
            directly into his telephoto lens. It was the first time he had noticed
            the voyeuristic spy in the apartment complex - it was a chilling
            moment in the film as he saw the threatening spectator and knew where
            he lived. Thorwald was alerted to the fact that he was being watched,
          and the tables were now turned. When a phone call came in to Jeff's
            apartment from Thorwald, Jeff accidentally identified himself as
            the voyeur. Soon after, Thorwald broke
            into Jeff's dark place across the courtyard. Defensively, Jeff set
            off bright flashbulb bursts to temporarily blind Thorwald, but eventually
            was overpowered and thrown out the window to the ground, after which
            Thorwald was apprehended by police. Jeff was shortly later seen now
            with a cast on both of his broken legs, and congratulated that his
            suspicions were well-founded - Thorwald
            had confessed that he had distributed his wife's body parts in the
            East River. Earlier because the dog had become &quot;too inquisitive,&quot; Thorwald
            was forced to dig up Mrs. Thorwald's head from the flower garden
            bed and move it to a hat box in his apartment.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Sabrina (1954), </b>112 minutes, D: Billy Wilder
        </font><br />
          <font size="2">Director Billy Wilder's delightful romantic comedy,
          with a light-hearted story, was a version of the <i>Cinderella</i> tale.
          Chauffeur's daughter Sabrina Fairchild (Audrey Hepburn) worked and
          lived at the large Larrabee estate on Long Island, NY with her widowed
          father, the family chauffeur Thomas Fairchild (John Williams). The
          youngest ultra-rich Larrabee son was light blonde, ne'er-do-well, womanizing,
          unattached playboyish David Larrabee (William Holden) who was three
          times divorced; his older brother was stuffy, formal, workaholic, middle-aged,
          conservative and uptight businessman Linus Larrabee (54 year-old Humphrey
          Bogart) who was running Larrabee Industries Ltd. and associated companies.
           Sabrina became  depressed and in despair about her unrequited
           love for David, and  tried to asphyxiate herself in the closed
            garage via carbon monoxide poisioning. She was dramatically rescued
           by Linus and carried back to her bedroom above the garage. During
           the next section of the film, Sabrina was urged by her father to find
           a cure for her hopeless romantic urgings and ambitions. She departed
           for Paris for chef and culinary training at Le Cordon Bleu. Sabrina
           failed miserably at cooking in the school, but was trained in becoming
           more sophisticated and poised. Back in the Larrabee household, Linus
           manipulatively encouraged David, for solely business reasons, to enter
            into an engagement and marriage of convenience (and $20 million business
           deal) to wealthy socialite-heiress Elizabeth Tyson (Martha Hyer).
           David agreed to the &quot;merger,&quot; but was immediately overwhelmed by Sabrina
           who unexpectedly returned after two years. She had been transformed
          into a costumed <i>Cinderella</i> - a refined, sophisticated and cultured 22 year-old woman
           with a new hairdo and sleek clothes. Sabrina's father
           cautioned her about falling in love with David again, since he was
           engaged (and was planning to be married in 10 days). Linus schemed
          to waylay David's interest in Sabrina that would endanger the arranged
          marriage, but then found himself falling under Sabrina's romantic spell.
          The stodgy Linus continued his maneuverings to wean Sabrina away -
          to romance her and distract her from David.
          Gradually, however, Linus began to fall in love with Sabrina, although
          she was unaware that he had dishonest intentions
           regarding her future. Linus was thinking of 
           sailing her back to Paris on a French cruise liner within a week to
           get her out of the way (although she assumed that he would be traveling
           alone to Paris to rejuvenate his own unfulfilled romantic life). Actually,
           Linus' devious plan was to send Sabrina back to Paris <i>alone</i>,
           even though he had reserved two spots on the cruise liner for them.
           He would pay for Sabrina's living expenses in Paris and support her
           with a car, apartment, bank credit ($50,000), and 1,500 shares of
           preferred Larrabee stock would be granted to her father. When Sabrina
            saw two tickets to Paris on Linus' desk, she believed that he had
           booked passage for both of them. In a dramatic revelation, Linus dashed
           her hopes and dreams, by admitting his plan was to send her back to
           Paris <i>alone</i> - as part of his scheme to keep her away from David. She
            departed with her ticket to sail away alone (the next day), and sadly
            said farewell. The next morning during a Larrabee board meeting,
            Linus shockingly announced that he had called off his brother's wedding
           - he had arranged for David to take his place to Paris with Sabrina.
           However, David appeared and showed off an afternoon newspaper announcement
            of Linus' elopement with Sabrina to Paris. In the film's major plot
            twist, David explained that the expected romance between himself
            and Sabrina had been transferred to Linus. After orchestrating an
            entirely different scenario and role reversal (that placed the importance
            of love over business), David encouraged Linus to end up with Sabrina
            in Paris. David's own marriage and merger would proceed as scheduled, while 
            David had arranged for Linus to sail to Paris with Sabrina -
            a tugboat was prepared to take him to the ocean liner. Linus rushed
            off from the meeting to rendezvous with Sabrina - on the boat to
            Paris.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Salt of the Earth (1954)</b>, 94 minutes, D: Herbert J.
            Biberman<br />
          Director Herbert J. Biberman's and writer Michael
              Wilson's independently-made, political and social commentary historical
              drama was about American working people. It was the only theatrical-length
          film ever openly made in the US by a group of blacklisted film-makers.
          The film was based upon a real-life zinc miners
              strike in Grant County, NM of Mexican workers in 1951 against
          the Empire Zinc Company. The film's
                narrator and heroine, Esperanza Quintero (Rosaura Revueltas),
                lived with  her oppressed miner husband Ramon Quintero (Juan
                Chac&oacute;n) who had worked in the mines for 18 years. They
                were a typical impoverished Mexican-American family with two
                young children, living in a run-down shack (without utilities)
                owned by the mining company (Delaware Zinc) in San Marcos, renamed
                to Zinc Town. After her husband
               Ramon experienced a nearly-tragic dynamite explosion in the mine
                with unsafe working conditions and racial prejudice, he complained
                to the company's white representative Chief Foreman Barton (David
                Wolfe) who was unsympathetic, and a second accident brought the
                same result.  The miners' union threatened to stop
              their work and initiate a strike. A months-long
              struggle of the striking miners (and their picketing wives in support)
              began, to overturn the oppressive system and its owners, provide
              safer working conditions, equal pay for equal work, better sanitation
              (hot running water, plumbing) and health care. For his resistance,
              Ramon was handcuffed, arrested by two bigoted policemen, beaten
              in the back of a squad car, and jailed for a month - charged with
              assault and resisting arrest, and meanwhile Esperanza gave birth
              to their third child. The strike  was extended for many  months
              when the company refused to negotiate,
              forcing some mining families to leave the area. The situation became
              desperate for those who remained. There was some help and aid in
              the form of letters and contributions that poured in from everywhere
              to support them. A crisis arose when the Sheriff brought a Taft-Hartley
              Act injunction (supportive of the mine owners)  against
              the unionized male miners to end their strike. To counter-act and
              bypass the injunction, the wives decided to band together and 
               picket for the men. A motion (with the women voting) was carried
              to allow the women to picket for the men. Forming a picket line,
              the women stood fast when the Sheriff and his deputies attempted
              to disperse them, and successfully fought back. In retaliation
              against the resistance, the Sheriff (with pressure from mine representatives
               and the company) was given orders to arrest the determined Esperanza
               (and other leading female ring-leaders). Esperanza refused to
               be separated from her baby and children and was hauled off in
               the back of a pick-up to the local jail. After Esperanza's release
               from jail four days later, she told Ramon that they wouldn't be
               arrested again, since they had caused such a ruckus. During a
               domestic argument with her husband, Esperanza stated: &quot;You can't win
               this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!&quot; One
               final back-breaking tactic was to issue eviction orders to remove
               all of the striking families from their company-owned homes, beginning
               with the Quintero family. Everyone gathered around the house to
               defy and resist the eviction order peacefully - with solidarity
               and dignity, and soon vastly outnumbered the police. They were
               able to successfully protest the unjust eviction by their adversaries
               and save the home from eviction. In the conclusion, the Delaware
               Zinc Company admitted defeat and began negotiations with the union
               of mine workers to settle the strike.  </font></p>        </td>

        124 minutes, D: Kenji Mizoguchi<br />
          Kenji Mizoguchi's very moving and sad drama (about a family torn apart)
          was set in medieval 11th century Japan during a time of warring social
          classes and rampant slavery and brutality. A family in 11th century
          feudal Japan was comprised of the idealistic father Masauji Taira (Masao
          Shimizu), his wife Tamaki (Kinuyo Tanaka), their daughter Anju
          (Ky&ocirc;ko Kagawa) and his young son Zushi&ocirc;  (Yoshiaki Hanayagi).
          The virtuous, humanitarian and compassionate feudal
          governor and father Masauji treated his peasant subjects fairly
            (and refused to overtax them). Before
            his ouster and exile, Masauji offered wise advice to his young son
            Zushio - along with a small golden statue-amulet representing the
            Goddess of Mercy, Kwannon: &quot;Zushio, I wonder
            if you'll become a stubborn man like me. You may be too young
            to understand, but hear me out anyway. Without mercy, man is
            like a beast...Even if you are hard on yourself, be merciful
            to others. Men are created equal. Everyone is entitled to their
        happiness.&quot;  The feudal governor was ousted, banished
            and exiled to a remote province for not enforcing the harsh tax laws
            (on rice) and the military draft. His aristocratic
            family embarked on a lengthy search for him. In a devastating
            sequence, the members of the family were separated during a lakeside
            seizure - tricked by a priestess and sold to the estate 
			of Sansh&ocirc; (Eitar&ocirc; Shind&ocirc;),
            a ruthless, cruel and corrupt bailiff, tax-collector and manager
            of a lordship's manor, who maintained a large slave contingent; the
            two children became indentured servants when sold into slavery, and
          the mother Tamaki was sold into prostitution on Sado Island. While
            enslaved in the camp's compound, Anju retained her humanity,
            while Zushio lost his compassion by mercilessly punishing and
            executing other slaves and becoming one of Sansho's enforcers. Zushio
            neglected his father's advice as he became a barbaric henchman for
            Sansho and carried out murder and torture (branding the foreheads
          of attempted escapees with a hot sword) of other slaves. In a tragic
            scene, the two children were ordered to take a sick slave girl into
            the woods to die, and they decided to make an escape attempt. Anju
            persuaded Zushio to flee with the sick female, while she self-sacrificially
            drowned herself (off-screen) in a lake (to avoid capture and torture
            - &quot;Isn't life torture?&quot;). She created a diversion to save
          her brother by not revealing his location. Zushio successfully escaped
            and hid out in a monastery before appealing for mercy to the Emperor's
            Chief Advisor in Kyoto. After being recognized
            as the son of a once-respected governor, Zushio was reinstated to
            the position. Now elevated and converted, he was determined to criminalize
            slavery and fight against injustice. During a nihilistic sequence,
            the former slaves revolted and burned down Sansh&ocirc;'s manor,
            and exiled the nefarious bailiff. Later, Zushio resigned his governorship
          and was determined to locate his mother. In the
          film's catharctic ending, after twenty years, Zushio and his hobbled,
          half-mad mother (now aged, lame and blind, and with a shattered life)
          were tearfully reunited on the tsunami-devastated beach of the island
          of Sado. He heard his mother's singing - at first she didn't believe
          he was her son, but did identify him by using her fingers to trace
          the shape of his face. Then she was saddened to hear when he revealed
          that both Anju and her husband were dead: &quot;It's just you and
         I. We're all alone now.&quot; Zushio  claimed
            that he had finally adopted his father's teachings. </font></p>        </td>

          <font size="2"> Director Luchino Visconti's 3-Strip Technicolored historical
          period fantasy and melodrama was about an illicit, destructive and
          ill-fated romance, with lush sets and costuming. Its historical context
          was the 1860s - a time of Italian independence and unification. The
          film's setting was during the brief war between Italy (and Prussia)
          against the Austrian Empire in the summer of 1866. The film opened
          in the Austrian-occupied city of Venice, in a scene set in La Fenice
          Opera House half-way through a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's four-act
          opera <i>Il Trovatore</i> ('The Troubadour'). A political demonstration
          (considered sedition by the Austrians) broke out during the intermission
          due to Italian Nationalists stirring up protest in the audience. Leaflets
          were  distributed to express dissatisfaction with the presence
          of white-uniformed officers of the occupying-Austrian
          troops, who were sitting in the best seats in the house. An unhappily-married,
          well-educated and proud Italian aristocrat, Countess Livia Serpieri
          (Alida Valli), who was married to older businessman Count Serpieri
          (Heinz Moog), observed from her opera box. A shouting match of offending
          insults had broken out on the floor of the opera house between her
          radical, freedom-fighting cousin Marchese Roberto Ussoni (Massimo Girotti),
          the leader of the Resistance who had organized the protest, and handsome,
          young, vain and dashing adventurer - Austrian Lieutenant Franz
          Mahler (Farley Granger). Fearing for her cousin's life, the conniving
          Countess sought out the Lieutenant to prevent a scheduled duel-challenge
          from taking place. During a late-night curfew in the city, she again
          encountered  the womanizing, seductive Lieutenant and spent the entire
          evening with him strolling through the city's back alleys and canals.
          She was immediately smitten by him and struck up an ultimately-treacherous,
          indiscreet friendship and romance with him.
          The Countess recklessly betrayed her husband by remaining with the
          Lieutenant in a sordid and secretive relationship that soon became
          public knowledge. They often met in a room for sex that she had rented
          in the Old Quarter of Venice. By giving herself over to their promiscuous
          affair and living only for the present moment, she
          began to realize that she had lost control of her feelings. At the
          same time, she was blinded to the Lieutenant's real flawed and opportunistic,
          womanizing nature. The uncommitted, unworthy, manipulative cad and
          cheap phony was exploiting her while also entertaining other lady friends.
          Desperate to see him after he suddenly disappeared for a few days,
          she became paranoid, agonized and unreasonably jealous. Due to the
          war, the Countess was forced to flee from the city for safety to her
          husband's palazzo in the countryside. The Lieutenant risked following
          the Contessa there and snuck into her bedroom from the balcony, and
          expressed his sincere love for her before making love (off-screen).
          However, she began to wonder whether she had betrayed
            her country's revolutionary cause of independence and her highest
            ideals during their forbidden affair. The unprincipled Franz - using
            false pretenses - betrayed the Contessa, by asking for much of her
            money (funds that she had saved to support the &quot;cause&quot; of
            the Italian partisan rebels including her cousin Roberto, to fight
            the Austrians). The cowardly Lieutenant claimed that he could bribe
            a military doctor to certify him as unfit for duty so that he
            wouldn't have to go into battle. She was convinced to give up most
            of her fortune of over 3,000 florins earlier promised to her cousin
            Roberto. As a result of her betrayal of the rebels, the partisans
            were massacred and forced to retreat. As battles
            were being fought in the region during the war, the Contessa became
            anxious when she was unable to see the Lieutenant or receive further
            communications. Eventually, a letter arrived from Verona, thanking
            her for her financial support that effectively provided an exemption
            for him from the home-front. Ignoring the Lieutenant's specific directions
            to stay where she was, the Countess risked a dangerous coach ride
            to Verona through the war zone to see him. She surprised the gold-digger
            and &quot;drunken deserter&quot; Franz in a rented apartment that
            she had financed for him, where she found him in the company of young
            tart-prostitute Clara (Marcella Mariani), as he noted: &quot;I pay
            her with your money.&quot; He crassly and insultingly called the
            Countess his &quot;wealthy patroness&quot; who wasn't much better
            than the hired streetwalker. He claimed that she thought like he
            did - that love could be purchased. He had  enough of her love for
            him and yelled: &quot;I'm not your romantic hero! And I don't love
            you anymore,&quot; before he ordered her to get out.  The humiliated,
            abandoned, cuckolded and vengeful Contessa decided to find moral
            redress by betraying Franz (evidenced by his written letter) to a
            General in the Austrian Army. Afterwards, she was left all alone
            to cry out Franz' name as she staggered away. Franz was seized
            from the residence and immediately sentenced to be executed   
            by a firing squad for treasonous and dishonest desertion from
          the battlefield. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Stanley Donen<br />
              This successful MGM, Stanley Donen-directed film, in CinemaScope,
              was one of the best musicals of the mid-50s. It received a Best
              Picture nomination and had an Oscar-winning Musical Score (by Saul
              Chaplin and Adolph Deutsch). Other nominations included Best Color
              Cinematography, Best Film Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay.
              It featured great Gene de Paul/Johnny Mercer songs in the score,
              plus incredible dancing segments (although shot entirely on a sound
              stage). The musical was derived from a Stephen Vincent Benet short
              story titled <i>The Sobbin' Women</i>. Set in the 1850s
              in the Oregon Territory, it told about the six brothers of Adam
              Pontipee (Howard Keel) - an Oregon farmer (the eldest of seven
              brothers), who abducted maidens from town for purposes of marriage.
               In the early scenes, Adam journeyed to town to buy winter supplies
              (corn, farm equipment, etc.), and spotted the beautiful, hard-working
              Milly (Jane Powell), who was chopping wood and serving home-made
              stew to customers at a local boarding house. He decided that they
              would get married since she would make a great cook and house-keeper.
              On the way back to the remote Pontipee farm, she sang about her
              married future with him - not knowing that she would be caring
              for six younger, rough lumberjacking brothers as well. After meeting
              Adam's six unmarried, unruly and rambunctuous brothers and their
              unkempt house, Milly realized that Adam had married her for her
              maid skills. Milly took it upon herself to civilize the
              brothers, and taught them about the etiquette of courting women.
              About a month later came the film's highlight - a lively and large-scale
              dance number - an 8-minute barn-raising dance sequence in the local
              town. It began with a competitive challenge dance of acrobatic
              leaps and balletic steps (between the local suitors in town and
              the Pontipees). The barn-raising was followed by a rowdy fist-fighting
              brawl between the brothers and other jealous suitors in town who
              were all vying for the attention of the young women. After the
              brawling fight in town and the approach of winter, during chore-time,
              the lovesick brothers lamented their situation and pined for female
              companionship, while chopping wood (with rhythmic axe blows and
              saw strokes). Adam came up with a dubious
              plan for the brothers, based on the ancient Roman
            legend of the Rape of the Sabine Women. The
            brothers went to town to kidnap the women, then brought them home,
              and as they were pursued, a snowslide on a mountain pass blocked
              the road behind them. They were saved, but the six females were
              also trapped for the winter. When Milly discovered what had happened,
              she banished the brothers to sleep in the barn for the winter and
              prohibited any more courting. Adam was also a target of Milly's furious wrath and
            he was forced to leave for the mountains and exiled for the winter
            in his hunting cabin. With the arrival of spring, the women were
            now wishing to pursue romance and get married after a long winter
              - and the six couples were reunited. Meanwhile, Milly gave birth
              to a baby girl in the spring. Adam returned and made up with
              Milly, and helped to care for their newborn child Hannah. He was
              also  ready to announce that the women would be returned to
              their families, but the plan was opposed by the brothers - and
              the women who wanted to stay - they ran off. At the same time,
              the fathers of the abducted women and their angry suitors arrived,
              caused a fracas, and threatened to hang the brothers. However,
              the sounds of Hannah's crying prompted all of the females to claim
              that the baby was theirs (&quot;Mine!&quot;). The Reverend Elcott (Ian Wolfe),
              Alice's father, conducted a six-way shot-gun wedding ceremony.
              The film concluded with a sweethearts' song sung by the brothers
              and their new brides, in various springtime settings for each of
              the courting couples.</font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Seven Samurai (1954, Jp.) (aka Shichinin
                No Samurai)</strong>, 207 minutes, D: Akira Kurosawa<br />
                Director Akira Kurosawa's epic dramatic masterpiece set in the
                year 1586 was later used as a template for the western <i>The
                Magnificent Seven (1960). </i> It was about a Japanese peasant
                village protected from roving hordes of bandits by seven unemployed,
                recruited samurai or ronin (swordsmen), who were compensated
                with three meals of rice a day and lodging. The 16th century
                epic plot was set during the Sengoku Period, a lawless time of
                civil wars when farmers were at the mercy of ferocious brigands
                of bandits.  The villagers met together to ask: Should they surrender
                their harvest to the bandits, or fight back against them?   
              The village's elder-patriarch Gisaku (Kokuten K&ocirc;d&ocirc;)
              who lived in an old mill advised briskly: &quot;Find <i>hungry</i> samurai.&quot;
              Wise veteran leader ronin (samurai warrior) Kambei Shimada (Takashi
              Shimura), after saving a hostage child from a thief, attracted
              a wealthy, idealistic, and immature young nobleman named Katsushiro
              Okamoto (Isao Kimura), who eagerly begged to be Kambei's disciple-acolyte.
              The farmers asked Kambei (and Katsushiro) to help defend their
              village, who agreed and then went about recruiting  
              four more masterless samurai warriors (seven in total, including
              himself). The  last to be recruited was a burly,
              wild, eccentric, annoying, amusing and arrogant Kikuchiyo (Toshiro
              Mifune). Back in the mountainous village, the farmers  were trained
              to fight in small squad groups with spears for an anticipated siege.
              Master Kambei surveyed the village with a hand-drawn map and prepared
              for the strategic defense of its perimeter by flooding some of
              the fields,   creating a moat, evacuating three outlying houses
              that would be impossible to protect, and establishing  high bamboo
              fence-barriers. One surprising revelation was that Kikuchiyo wasn't
              really a samurai after all, but the son of a village peasant who
              clearly identified with the plight of the villagers. A secret and
              private romantic relationship developed between Katsushiro and
              the pretty young daughter Shino (Keiko Tsushima) of paranoid villager
              Manzo (Kamatari Fujiwara), who had ordered her to disguise herself
              as a male by cutting her hair. After subduing and killing three
              bandit scouts, the samurai decided to conduct
              a pre-emptive strike on the bandits' large encampment a half-day
              ride away, by burning it down. One samurai - a woodchopper named
              Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki) unfortunately lost his life (a musket
              shot in the back) during the conflict.
              The climax of the film was a lengthy 3-day battle against about
              40 armed bandits who returned to assault the village; they first
              attacked and burned the outlying huts and old mill barn across
              the stream, where they murdered the stubborn Old Man elder and
              a young couple (with a child). During hand-to-hand combat and the
              use of spears by the farmers, several of the bandits were killed
              attempting to scale the barricades or cross the moats. The smart
              strategy of the samurai was to allow only a few bandits (in the
              cavalry) at a time to enter into the village on horseback through
              a small gap or entryway - before surrounding and ambushing them
              one-by-one. An unnecessary breach in the fortifications led to
              the death of more villagers, and expert archer Gorobei Katayama
              (Yoshio Inaba) was also slain (off-screen) at his post (it was
              the second of four samurai casualties). Kambei knew that the third
              and last day of fighting would be a showdown and &quot;a fight
              to the finish.&quot; Realizing
              that they might die, Shino encouraged Katsushiro to have sex with
              her, but then they were embarrassed after being caught by her father
              Manzo, who considered her now to be &quot;damaged goods.&quot; The
              rain-soaked  last day of fighting was in the mud during torrential
              downpours against the remaining 13 bandits. Samurai swordsman Kyuzo
              (Seiji Miyaguchi) with his sword drawn outside was shot in the
              back by the dishonorable Bandit Chief (Shinpei Takagi) hiding in
              the woman's hut. The fourth and final samurai casualty was Kikuchiyo
              who was charging into the hut to avenge Kyuzo's death when he was
              shot in the abdomen. He briefly revived and retaliated against
              the bandit chief by skewering him with his sword before dying of
              his own lethal wounds. The remaining bandits were defeated. The
              final scene was of the farmers finally at peace again - planting
              their next crop of rice. Due to class differences, Katsushir&#333; and
              Shino could never fulfill their romance. With Katsushiro, Kambei
              and Shichir&#333;ji (Daisuke Kat&ocirc;) viewed
           the graves or funeral mounds of their four dead comrades (each
              with a samurai sword sticking out), above the graves of the fallen
              villagers. Kambei spoke the final lines of dialogue to Shichir&#333;ji
              about how the victory belonged to the farmers, but not to the samurai: &quot;In
              the end, we lost this battle too...I mean, the victory belongs
          to those peasants. Not to us.&quot; </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Silver Lode (1954)</strong>, 81 minutes,
              D: Allan Dwan<br />
              Director Allan Dwan's and RKO's taut and suspenseful, Technicolored
              psychological low-budget western was a 'guilt-by-suspicion' allegorical
              film masking as a succinct and timely criticism of the Cold War's
              McCarthy era (and very close in theme and plot to <a href="high.html"><i>High
        Noon (1952)</i></a>). During a July 4th
        celebration in the frontier town of Silver Lode in Nevada, four men
        on horseback arrived from the town of Discovery, California. The
        foursome group of law officials was led by accusatory and vengeful
        'Marshal' Fred McCarty (Dan Duryea) (the name was a clear reference
        to Sen. Joseph McCarthy). The Marshal's three 'deputies' were Johnson
        (Harry Carey Jr.), Kirk (Alan Hale Jr.) and Wicker (Stuart Whitman).
        A marriage ceremony in progress in the town's church was abruptly interrupted.
        The couple being married was respected, wealthy rancher/citizen and town
        sheriff Dan Ballard (John Payne) (a reformed, ex-gunslinger from two
        years earlier) and his pretty fiancee Rose Evans (Lizabeth
        Scott), the daughter of wealthy Zachary Evans (Morris Ankrum). The zealous
        McCarty claimed they were on a manhunt with an arrest warrant for 
        Ballard for the crimes of murder and theft committed two years earlier
        - the robbery of $20,000 from McCarty's brother by Ballard who cheated
        during a poker game, and then  murdered the brother (with a bullet in
        the back). Ballard who knew of McCarty and his brother (both rustlers
        and outlaws from the past) called him a liar and the charges false. McCarty
        demanded that Ballard be extradited and accompany them to California
        where the murder occurred. The wrongly-accused Ballard decided to hold
        off on his wedding. Ballard confessed to Rose that the brother's murder
        was in self-defense: &quot;I did kill his brother&quot; - but not in the back. In front of the
        town's Judge Cranston (Robert Warwick), McCarty's extradition request
        was upheld; however, the judge allowed Ballard two hours to delay
        (or stall) the proceedings to track down evidence to clear his
        name and prove his innocence.  The telegrapher Paul Herbert (Frank Sully)
        was pressured by Ballard to send the same message to two Sheriffs in
        Discovery, and a third to the US Marshal in San Francisco, to receive
        verifications to confirm McCarty's identity and warrant. However, the
        transmissions failed - the lines appeared to be down (Ballard immediately
        suspected that the wires had been deliberately cut by McCarty). Ballard
        was able to bribe or buy off Johnson, one of McCarty's 'deputies', for
        $5,000 cash to reveal the truth and turn on McCarty and expose him. In
        the town's livery stable, Johnson admitted that McCarty had cut the telegraph
        wires and also possessed forged Marshal paper credentials and then killed
        the forger. Listening from the upper stable loft, McCarty shot Johnson
        dead, and then blamed Ballard for the murder: &quot;Ballard
        just shot Johnson!&quot; And then when Sheriff Wooley in the loft overheard
        McCarty's incriminating conversation with Ballard, he was
        also shot dead. McCarty blamed both murders
        (Johnson and the Sheriff) on the guilty-looking Ballard. When pressured
        to surrender, Ballard was forced to escape and flee on horseback and
        defend himself, and he killed the other two 'deputies' (Kirk and Wicker)
        and slightly wounded Rose's brother Michael &quot;Mitch&quot; Evans (John
        Hudson). Pursued by McCarty and other deputized townsmen during a house-to-house search,
        the very desperate and wounded Ballard - filmed with a series
        of masterfully-choreographed tracking shots - was followed as he ran
        across town from the Evans' home and down Main Street to the church,
        where he found sanctuary granted by the town's Reverend Field (Hugh Sanders).
        Meanwhile in the telegraph office, Ballard's bride-to-be Rose and Ballard's
        ex-mistress and saloon girl Dolly (Dolores Moran) (who had joined forces)
        pressured Herbert to forge a phony telegram return-response showing that
        McCarty's credentials had been falsified. Rose raced with the manufactured
        telegram to Judge Cranston at the church, who read it outloud to all
        the townsfolk: (&quot;McCarty not what he represents himself to be. Wanted
        for murder and cattle rustling. Dan Ballard innocent of charge&quot;)
        - the news exonerated Ballard and proclaimed his innocence. Simultaneously,
        there was a climactic confrontational showdown scene high up in the church
        bell-tower. The cornered, defenseless, unarmed and wounded Ballard was
        stalked by the evil, gun-shooting antagonist McCarty. Ballard was saved
        -- literally, when McCarty's own bullet ricocheted off the giant swinging
        church bell, and he was struck in the heart by his own deflected bullet.
        The reprieved and saved Ballard descended from the church bell-tower
        and angrily scorned the townsfolk who only retroactively apologized.
        In the film's epilogue, Ballard's name and reputation were cleared and
        it was confirmed that he was innocent all along and had been telling
        the truth. The receipt of a real telegram from Sheriff Harper in Discovery,
        CA completely and truly exonerated him: (&quot;Fred McCarty wanted. Murder
        and Rustling. US Marshal on way to Silver Lode&quot;). </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: George Cukor<br />
              Director George Cukor's  dramatic musical and classic
            tearjerker was a superior remake of  William Wellman's
            non-musical, classic 1937 film of the same name, starring Janet Gaynor
            and Fredric March that was inspired by <i>What Price Hollywood? (1932)</i> also
            directed by Cukor. [Note: It was also updated to
              modern times twice as a musical drama - first as <i>A Star Is Born
              (1976)</i> with Barbra Steisand and Kris Kristofferson, and second
              as <i>A Star Is Born (2018)</i>, starring director/actor Bradley
              Cooper and Lady Gaga.] The film opened during a late-night gala
          benefit &quot;Night of Stars&quot; held at Hollywood's Shrine Auditorium,
          where boozing, womanizing, brilliant, but fading alcoholic movie actor
          Norman Maine (James Mason) lurched onstage during a song and dance
          act being performed by young, aspiring newcomer-star actress and vocalist
          Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland). Impressed by her, later that night
           Norman tracked her down and found her in an empty, after-hours Sunset
          Strip musicians' hangout where he watched her sing. He drove her home
          and expressed how impressed he was with her star quality and spark
          of genius. He promoted her with his studio for a screen test, and her
          career was quickly launched and on the rise in Hollywood - as a singing
          sensation with a new name Vicki Lester. Her film debut preview was
          a sensational success, compared to the lukewarm reception that Norman's
          film received - Norman's popularity was definitely in reverse and on
          the decline. Although Vicki was concerned about Norman's drinking,
          she accepted his impulsive proposal of marriage and they had a very
          private ceremony. Afterwards, their marriage was tested by the tragic
          consequences of Norman's personal self-destruction, disintegration
          and loss of fame. Norman was told that he was being dropped at the
          studio, because he had become too big a risk, lapsing in his screen
          performances due to his alcoholism. Norman soon realized how much attention
          Vicki was receiving <i>and</i> how much the public
          had already forgotten him, and he took to drinking more heavily. In
           the annual Academy Awards Banquet Ceremony scene, Norman abruptly
          interrupted the proceedings. He gestured wildly on stage and accidentally
          slapped Vicki while she was delivering her acceptance speech for Best
          Actress. Norman was admitted to a sanitarium for treatment of his alcoholism.
          After Norman's discharge months later, he spent some of his spare time
          at the Santa Anita Race Track, and his initial efforts to sober up
          seemed promising. However, he went on a monumental drinking binge and
          was arrested and threatened with jail-time. Esther
          was willing to sacrifice her career to help her husband Norman regain
          his stability and sobriety, and she brought him back under her custody
          to their Malibu home. She told Niles that she planned to quit Hollywood
          so that she could go away for good and take care of him, to restore
          his health. Norman overheard their conversation and - in the film's
          shocking, tragic but inevitable sequence, he  committed suicide
          by walking into the ocean from the beach house at dawn. In the film's
          memorable conclusion, Vicki was persuaded  by her  studio
          accompanist Danny McGuire (Tommy Noonan) to come out of mourning
          to perform and keep Norman's memory alive. She posthumously honored
          her husband onstage at a Shrine
          Auditorium benefit concert where she proudly introduced herself
          as Mrs. Norman Maine (&quot;Hello everybody. This is Mrs. Norman Maine&quot;).</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>La Strada (1954, It.) (aka The Road)</strong>,
        94 minutes, D: Federico Fellini</font><br />
        <font size="2">Director Federico Fellini's romantic, tear-jerking drama
        and timeless modern-day spiritual fable about domestic/sexual abuse and
        oppression  was the first-ever Academy Awards winner for Best Foreign
        Language Film (Italy). In war-ravaged Italy after 
        the war, traveling strongman and circus performer
        Zampano (Anthony Quinn) appeared at the seaside family village of his
        recently-deceased female companion Rosa. He bargained with Rosa's widowed
        mother (Anna Primula) to  purchase another daughter - naive, wide and
        saucer-eyed young  Gelsomina (director Fellini's wife Giulietta
        Masina), for 10,000 lire, to replace Rosa as his acting companion and
        partner. The simple-minded, free-spirited waif and gamin had
        no choice but to accept the arrangement. On the road, the itinerant,
        brutish street-performer Zampano performed a chain-breaking act with
        his chest and &quot;lungs of steel&quot;, and taught Gelsomina to preface his street
        act with music (banging on a drum) and by dressing as a clown. Zampano
        was revealed to be physically and psychologically abusive - he beat Gelsomina
        with a tree switch when she didn't obey, and then went off and abandoned
        her one evening with a red-headed prostitute. Zampano continued to deflect
        probing questions that Gelsomina asked about his life with Rosa. She
        decided to rebel against him, and announced her decision to leave him: &quot;I
         go away - Back to my village.&quot; Gelsomina was led into a nearby town
         by three musicians, and after following a religious procession, she
         watched another street performer's
         act  on a high-wire tightrope - executed by Il Matto (&quot;The
         Fool&quot;)
        (Richard Basehart). Zampano tracked her down, and
        forcibly ordered her back into the truck (&quot;Get in&quot;). Soon
        after, they joined Giraffa's circus, where it was discovered that Il
        Matto was also employed. A compulsive, feuding conflict immediately developed
        between the mindless Zampano and the
        taunting and witty Il Matto (who couldn't help but recklessly
        tease, antagonize and insult Zampano), causing Zambano to become enraged.
        After a wild altercation between them, Zampano angrily drew a knife and
        chased after Il Matto; Zampano was handcuffed and briefly jailed by police,
        and both men were permanently fired from the circus. Both the circus
        owner and Il Matto offered Gelsomina a chance to accompany them, but
        she felt compelled to remain with Zampano. In one memorable scene, Il
        Matto convinced Gelsomina of her own life's worth, and she brightened
        up, but then interpreted  his advice as a justification for selflessly
        remaining dedicated to Zampano. During an overnight stay in a barn next
        to a nun's monastery,  Gelsomina asked Zampano to marry
        her, but he rejected her request and remained silent. After leaving the
        monastery, Zampano's truck came upon Il Matto fixing his broken-down
        car's flat tire on a rural road. During a brutal brawl between the two,
        Il Matto suffered severe head injuries, complained about his broken watch
        (a symbol of his life's end) and then collapsed dead next to the road.
        To cover up the crime, Zampano dragged Il Matto's body (in a crucifix
        pose) and dumped it in a creek and then pushed his car off a bridge (with
        a fiery crash). They were now on the run from the law and a predictable
        prison term for Zampano. Traumatized by Il Matto's (The Fool's) demise,
        for the next ten days, the lifeless, mute, soul-injured Gelsomina couldn't
        perform in the sideshows, and Zampano decided to abandon her for good.
        Four to five years later, Zampano was working for the traveling Medini
        Circus. While walking in town, he heard the same unforgettable song
        that Gelsomina often played on the trumpet - it was being sung by a woman
        hanging up sheets. He was told that the woman's father had taken in the
        feverish, sickened, mute and a &quot;little bit crazy&quot; vagabond
        (Gelsomina) after she had left the circus and was found near the beach.
        The woman had often heard her play a trumpet, but then Gelsomina became
        severely ill and didn't wake up one morning. In the tragic film's conclusion,
        the  stony-hearted Zampano became drunk, brawled in a bar, and then stumbled
        alone to the seashore in the darkness while yelling:
        &quot;I want to be alone. Alone!&quot;  There, he waded into the
        edge of the water, fell onto the sand, looked up to the heavens,
        broke down into tears (showing true emotion), and vainly grasped
        at the sand that slipped through his fingers. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Them! (1954)</b>, 94 minutes, D: Gordon Douglas<br />
          Director Gordon Douglas' paranoic mid-50s, sci-fi horror film creature
              feature  reflected the time period of the Cold War mid-1950s,
              when a new era of testing dangerous atomic weapons in the mid-1940s
              was feared to have caused mutations. It was one of the most classic
              mutant monster B-flicks - &quot;THEM!&quot; was noted as the first &quot;Big
              Bug&quot; Monster feature with great special effects and a convincing
              story - setting off a science-fiction trend.  The main terror facing
              mankind was ants that had mutated into giant creatures - they
              were considered the only other species that engaged in war.   The
              sci-fi film opened in the New Mexico desert, where two state troopers
              Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) and his partner Ed Blackburn
              (Chris Drake) found a traumatized, mute five
            or six year-old girl (Sandy Descher) (later identified with the
            last name of Ellinson) wandering in shock and trance-like, carrying
            her doll. The child was found near her  
            trailer camp (where she was staying with her parents and brother);
              they were missing and there was evidence that they had been attacked
              and the trailer was destroyed. While the girl was lying in
              an ambulance and about to be taken to a hospital, a peculiar, vibrating
              sound prompted her to sit up. Twelve miles away  was &quot;Gramps&quot; 
          Johnson's General Store that had also been ransacked and destroyed,
          and  the store owner (Mathew McCue) was found dead. A large wooden
          barrel of sugar was knocked down and open, and the sweet powder was
          being consumed by small ants. Left alone at the murder scene, Officer
          Blackburn was  attacked and killed as  he went to investigate another
           high-pitched sound off-screen. FBI agent Robert Graham
          (James Arness) from Alamagordo, NM was called in, and two scientists
          (ant entomologists) from the Department of Agriculture in Washington
          DC arrived: Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn) and his pretty daughter
          Dr. Pat Medford (Joan Weldon). At the hospital, the young
              girl was revived out of her shocked state by a sniff of formic
          acid provided by Dr. Medford, and she screamed: &quot;THEM! THEM!!!!
          THEMM!!!!&quot; While exploring during a raging sandstorm at the
              site of the destroyed trailer, Pat screamed when one giant ant
          attacked her from behind and was able to attract the attention of the
          others. It was pulverized with submachine
            gun fire. Dr. Medford identified the creature as a mutation
              - part of a race of giant radioactive and carnivorous ants
              with large mandibles that had decended from a radiated ant. Its
           odor of formic acid was what triggered the girl to violently react,
          and Gramps' corpse was filled with the substance after being injected
          through the ant's stinger: &quot;Ants use their mandibles to rend,
          tear and hold their victims but they kill with that, by injecting formic
          acid.&quot; The Medfords both suggested locating the colony
              of the foraging &quot;scout&quot; ant. The cone-shaped mound of
              the ant's nest was located from the air - it was a deep hole in
              the desert ground. At noon the next day, 
              the nest's opening was bombed and burned with bazookas and the
              tunnels were then gassed with cyanide. To determine the results,
              Pat, Graham, and Sgt. Peterson rappelled into the nest and its
              deep tunnels to explore.  The Queen Ant's chamber with two empty,
              hatched eggs was ordered to be incinerated. Dr. Medford was worried
              that two young Queen Ants had hatched and escaped, and would now
              mate and produce further nests elsewhere. Further unusual sightings
              or disturbances included a report from Brownsville, Texas by ranch
              foreman Alan Crotty (Fess Parker) who crashed his plane after sighting
              three ant-shaped flying saucers.  Traveling from Acapulco, Mexico
              to Singapore, the <i>S.S. Viking</i> was infested
              with giant killer ants and had to be sunk  with naval gunfire.
              Two troubling incidents were also reported in Los
            Angeles - probably the result of the hatched Queen Ants: (1)
            40 tons of sugar had been stolen from a railroad car, and (2)  a
            father named Thomas Lodge was killed and his two sons Jerry and Mike
              mysteriously disappeared while they were flying a model airplane
              in LA's concrete river basin near the opening to 700 miles of storm
              drain sewer tunnels below the city. Martial law and a curfew were
              issued for the city of Los Angeles, and an informative descriptive
              news bulletin was broadcast over TV about the emergency. During
              a rescue attempt with the cooperation of the Army (Jeeps were driven
              into various sections of the LA tunnel system), Sgt. Peterson rescued
              the two threatened boys by aiming his flamethrower at the giant
              ants, but then was killed by one of them when grabbed around the
              waist with its giant mandibles. Dr. Medford ordered the destruction
              of the nest's chamber (with unhatched Queen eggs) in Drain # 267
              with bazookas and flame throwers. The film concluded with more
              ominous words (the film's final line of dialogue) from Dr. Medford: &quot;When
              Man entered the Atomic Age, he opened a door into a new world.
              What we'll eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict.&quot;</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Three Coins in the Fountain (1954)</b>, 102 minutes,
            D: Jean Negulesco<br />
        Director Jean Negulesco's Fox's light, glossy, vapid and Technicolored
        CinemaScopic sentimental, escapist romantic travelogue was a big-budget
        film about the blossoming of love affairs for three romance-minded American
        secretaries in Rome. While wearing designer clothes and experiencing
        an unusually uncrowded Rome (&quot;The Eternal
        City&quot;), they became romantically involved with three Italian men
        while working there. It received three Academy Awards nominations (including
        Best Picture) and won two Oscars: Best Color Cinematography (for Milton
        Krasner) and Best Song (the title song &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; sung
        by Frank Sinatra in the film's opening). In the early 1950s, young American
        Maria Williams (Maggie McNamara) arrived for a new job as a secretary
        at the U.S. Distribution Agency (USDA) for boss Mr. Burgoyne (Howard
        St. John). Maria was picked up by the secretary she was replacing - Anita
        Hutchins (Jean Peters), who was returning to the US to allegedly marry
        her fiancee. She was taken to Villa Eden, where she met 
        Miss Frances (Dorothy McGuire) who had been employed for 15 years as
        the secretary for great American author John Frederick Shadwell (Clifton
        Webb), a stuffy, anti-social and elderly ex-pat who owned the villa.
        At the famous Trevi Fountain, the three followed the custom of throwing
        a coin into the pool over one's shoulder while making a wish (&quot;a
        penny's worth of hope&quot;)
        - yet the wish would only come true  if one wished to return to Rome.
        Anita declined to make a wish since she was leaving Rome to be married
        in the US.  At her place of work, Anita
             introduced Maria to  the agency's handsome translator
            Giorgio Bianchi (Rossano Brazzi), one of her co-workers for two
            years. It was office policy that American and Italian employees weren't
            allowed to fraternize: (&quot;Secretaries are not allowed to go out
            with local employees&quot;), to avoid labeling the American girls
            as trampish. During a swanky afternoon cocktail party, Maria  
            met rumored, notorious wealthy womanizer Prince Dino di Cessi (Louis
            Jourdan) at the party and was entranced by him. Shortly later, Anita
            confessed to Maria that she had lied about being engaged to a
            fiancee in the US. Contrary to the agency's rules, Giorgio invited
            Anita (before she left Rome) to attend his family's country farm <i>festa</i> (or
            celebration) the next day for his sister's engagement. At the festa,
              Anita was endangered by his cousin's runaway brakeless truck, and
            Giorgio's efforts to save her brought out their unspoken love for
            each other. Meanwhile, Maria was invited by playboyish Prince Dino
            to accompany him on his plane to Venice for the day. She maneuvered
            to have Miss Frances chaperone them. Due to Mr. Burgoyne's suspicions
            about Anita's social time with her co-worker over the weekend, Giorgio
            was fired on Monday &quot;without a recommendation.&quot; Anita was
            extremely upset by Giorgio's predicament - she told him that she
            wanted to be with him and then admitted that she didn't really have
            a fiancee. Meanwhile, Maria was maneuvering to impress the Prince
            by feigning considerable interest in his various likes and dislikes
            (that she had researched). Her ploy worked too well, and she met
            his mother Principessa (Cathleen Nesbitt) who blessed their relationship.
            Maria was so overwhelmed with guilt about her heartless deceptions
            and betrayals to Dino that she was compelled to confess her manipulative
            dishonesty. Dino was stunned by her admission and angrily drove her
            home. The romantic prospects for both Anita and Maria were now shattered.
            Anita returned to her apartment after spending time with Giorgio's
            family at the farm after his firing, and although she was in love
            with Giorgio, they had decided that they couldn't marry because he
            was &quot;dreadfully
          poor&quot; and  it wouldn't work between
          them. The guilt-stricken Maria had also decided to  pack and leave
          Rome. Now it was Miss Frances' turn to make a momentous decision and
          influence her own romantic ambitions - she would join Anita and Maria
          to go home. After 15 years of being an &quot;old maid in Rome,&quot; she
          announced her exit to Shadwell. To dissuade her from leaving, Shadwell
          casually made a &quot;genuine&quot; but &quot;rash offer&quot; of marriage,
           and Miss Frances promptly accepted.  The next day, Shadwell received
           a diagnosis from Dr. Martinelli (Vicente Padula) of terminal illness
           and that he had only a year to live. Back in the villa, Shadwell abruptly
           told Miss Frances that he had mistakenly, impulsively, and unseriously
           asked for her hand in marriage - and he retracted his offer. At a
           cafe, both of them became drunk on six double-scotches while they
           discussed his matter-of-fact reaction to his mortality and his refusal
           to be treated. While she recovered from being drunk, Shadwell decided
           to try and  help her friends with their complicated romances. He was
           able, with reverse psychology, to convince Prince Dino of his true
           love for Maria - who had gone to great lengths to pursue him and capture
           his interest. Off-screen, he also negotiated for Giorgio's job reinstatement
           with Mr. Burgoyne. Although both Anita and Maria were  leaving
           for the train station, they received a phone call from Miss Frances
           to meet her at the Trevi Fountain. In the film's concluding sequence,
           all three couples were reunited there - as the fountain's waters were
          revitalized and began to flow again after being emptied for cleaning:
          (&quot;Look!
        The fountain's coming to life again&quot;).</font></p>        </td>
