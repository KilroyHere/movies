        <p><font size="2"><b>Amour (2012, Fr.)</b>, 127 minutes, D: Michael Haneke<br />
        Writer/director Michael Haneke's grim and raw French-language romance
            drama told of the emotionally-complex difficulties of aging for an
            octogenarian couple when one of them suffered a debilitating stroke.
            In the story (told in flashback), elderly Georges and Anne (Jean-Louis
            Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva) were presented as retired classical-music
            teachers who lived together in a Paris apartment. Their daughter
            Eve ((Isabelle Huppert), also a musician, lived in Britain with her
            family, and often toured throughout Europe. One day over breakfast,
            Anne suffered a silent but severe stroke that made her catatonic.
            After surgery in the hospital to repair a blocked carotid artery,
            Anne was left paralyzed on her right side
            and confined to a wheelchair. Her devoted
          and dutiful husband declared that he was committed to becoming Anne's
            full-time caretaker at home, and refused to
            send her to a hospital or to a long-term care nursing home. On one
            occasion, he was  distressed when she became suicidal. After a
            second stroke, Anne underwent  a steep decline
            in both her mental and physical capacities and
            was unable to communicate in her demented state. The stresses and
            strains on the very-valiant Georges were becoming evident during
            his formidable and challenging task, even though he was assisted
            by a nurse three days a week. Eventually, the agonized Georges impulsively
            smothered Anne with a pillow. He prepared her corpse on a bed, adorned
            with cut flowers.</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Argo (2012)</b>, 120 minutes, D: Ben Affleck<br />
          Director/actor Ben Affleck's tense political thriller and historical
              docu-drama, a Best Picture-winning film, told about a secret rescue
              mission (known as &quot;The Canadian Caper&quot;) that occurred during the
              1979-1981 Iran hostage crisis. Its story was based upon two sources:
              CIA agent Tony Mendez's 1999 book <i>The Master of Disguise</i>,
              and by Joshuah Bearman's 2007 <i>Wired</i> magazine
              article, &quot;The Great Escape: How the CIA Used a Fake Sci-Fi Flick to Rescue Americans
              from Tehran.&quot; The historical background of the film involved the
              November, 1979 militant Iranian assault on the US Embassy in Tehran
              where 66 American Embassy staff members were taken hostage. However,
              during the siege, six of the hostages escaped and sought refuge
              in Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor's (Victor Garber) home. Consultant
              and CIA agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) devised a secret and daring
              rescue mission. With the cooperation of two film-industry veterans
              in Hollywood, film producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) and make-up
              artist John Chambers (John Goodman), they concocted a fake film
              production and film studio (Studio 6) as a cover story. Mendez
              would serve as the film's Canadian producer, and the film would
              be heavily advertised. The incredulous, deceptive, and clandestine
              idea of &quot;exfiltration&quot; was for Mendez (with the alias name of Kevin
              Harkins) to scout desert locations in Iran for the fictitious sci-fi
              film titled &quot;ARGO,&quot; and in the meantime, execute a rescue of the
              six hostages by flying them out on a commercial jet as part of
              the film's Canadian film crew. The tense rescue, with unexpected
              delays, was finally accomplished when the group boarded a Swissair
              flight at the Tehran airport and narrowly escaped - on day 87 of
              the continuing hostage crisis.</font></p>        </td>

        dwellings: a ramshackle, broken-down trailer and shack, located in the
        Southern Delta bayou town of Bathtub, LA that was occupied by many poor
        squatters. It was physically isolated and separated from the main town
        by a major levee. A major storm approached and threatened their lives
        with flooding, devastation, and contamination of the fresh water supply.
        (The sequence of the fierce storm waters was backed up by a climate change
        narrative being taught in school by Hushpuppy's teacher Miss Bathsheba
        (Gina Montana), who warned about the release of fierce, beastly, prehistoric
        frozen  <i>aurochs</i> (cattle)
        from the melting ice caps.) After the hurricane submerged their homes,
        and Hushpuppy attempted to blow up the levee with dynamite to drain
        the water, the residents were given mandatory evacuation orders and taken
        to an emergency shelter for refugees. At
        the same time - linked with nature's disorderly wrath, Hushpuppy faced
        the serious debilitating illness of her father who was coughing up blood
        and required surgery, and whose health was rapidly failing. She sought
        help on a fantastical journey to find her absent biological mother (that
        she never knew), but was unsuccessful. After a fearless stand-off face-to-face
        with the auroch creatures, Hushpuppy returned home just in time to say
        goodbye to her dying father. After listening to his last heartbeat, she
        set his funeral pyre on fire and watched as it burned with some of the
         residents of Bathtub.</font></p>        </td>

        Mark Andrews<br />
        Setting various milestones, this computer-animated, adventure-fantasy
        film by Pixar/Disney Studios was Pixar's first film with a female protagonist,
        the first to be a period piece, and the studio's first fairy-tale film.
        The film opened in the medieval Scottish Highlands, in the kingdom of
        King Fergus (voice of Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (voice of Emma
        Thompson), who had a young, six year-old Scottish princess daughter named
        Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald). Merida was
        gifted a bow and arrow for her birthday and would soon train to become
        a skilled archer. Her father 
        battled a fierce, demonic bear named Mor'du and
        lost one leg while saving the family. (In a legend-story told to Merida
        by her mother, the bear was originally a prince.) A decade later, the free-spirited,
        self-reliant, impetuous and reckless teenaged Merida refused to live
        a traditional life and defied age-old customs in her Dunbroch clan. She
        was being compelled to marry  the first-born son of one of her father's
        three allies (Lords MacGuffin, Macintosh, and Dingwall) - the victor
        in the upcoming Highland Games. Refusing to marry and also proclaiming
        herself a &quot;first-born,&quot; she proved her ability by out-performing all
        of the male competitors with her archery skills. Then, she ran away after
        arguing with her controlling and demanding mother and damaging one of
        her tapestries. In the cottage-hut of a witch in the forest, she asked
        for a spell and received a fateful, enchanted pie-cake that hid a terrible
        ancient curse. After her mother ate some of the pie-cake, she was soon
        transformed into a large black bear. The witch's added message added
        a warning - it declared that Merida had to &quot;mend
        the bond torn by pride&quot; before the 2nd sunrise or the unleashed
        spell on her mother would become permanent. In a quest to reverse the
        curse, Merida realized that she had made a mistake and had to atone for
        bringing a curse upon her mother in order to save her land, her kingdom,
        and her mother's life. She successfully reconciled with her mother after
        mending and repairing the   tapestry she had slashed the day before.</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Cabin in the Woods (2012)</b>, 95 minutes, D:
            Drew Goddard<br />
        Director Drew Goddard's directorial debut film was  specifically intended
        to be a satirical, tongue-in-cheek and self-aware horror film that deconstructed
        the entire genre of horror films within its twisty plot. The imaginative
        sci-fi horror-thriller plot commenced as a typical 'cabin in the woods'
        horror film - a group of five American college students traveled in an
        RV to a secluded, lakeside forest cabin - virginal, bookwormish Dana
        (Kristen Connolly) and her friends: athletic jock Curt (Chris Hemsworth),
        Curt's blonde and horny girlfriend Jules (Anna Hutchison), druggie-stoner
        and goofy, comical Marty (Fran Kranz), and nice-guy Holden (Jesse Willaims),
            for a weekend of promiscuous sex, drinking, swimming, and pot-smoking.
            Simultaneously, two engineering-technicians or operators - Gary Sitterson
            (Richard Jenkins) and Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford), who were led
            by their agent-supervisor Lin (Amy Acker) - were inside a mysterious,
        high-tech, underground control room where they were monitoring, controlling,
            staging, and manipulating the actions and environment of the students.
            (It appeared that there were a total of three similar arcane lab
            'experiments' or 'rituals' being held around the world - also 
            in Stockholm, Sweden and Japan.) The students stumbled into the cellar
            of the cabin and found various artifacts and curios, including an
        old diary of one of the cabin's young, abused residents named Patience
        Buckner (Jodelle Ferland) from the early 1900s. It described horrifying
        events that occurred amongst the sadistic Buckner family. After Dana
        read some of the incantations in the diary, she unwittingly unleashed
        the redneck family - composed of homicidal, backwoods zombies. In the
        completely mind-boggling conclusion, two of the surviving teens, Marty
        and Dana, entered the laboratory  where they unleashed caged monsters
        that killed all of the lab's workers. Then, inside an ancient temple,
        they were confronted by the Director (Sigourney
            Weaver) who explained that their experience at the cabin was part
            of a worldwide annual ritual of human sacrifice. It was conducted
        to appease cruel Ancient Ones or dark gods who once ruled the Earth -
        to keep them dormant. In the US version of the required ritual, five
        slasher-film stereotypical characters were to be sacrificed: the whore
        (Jules), the athlete (Curt), the scholar (Holden), the fool (Marty),
        and the virgin (Dana). The ritual would only be successful if the whore
        died first (she did), and the virgin was the last-survivor. Marty and
        Dana were left with a choice - should they cooperate, obey and save humanity
        by following the Director's stipulations, or not? The film ended with
        the angry gods emerging on the surface with a giant hand - to destroy
        mankind.</font></p>        </td>

          83 minutes, D: Jan Ole Gerster <br />
          In this B/W tragi-comedy
          with a moody jazz score from first-time feature film writer/director
          Jan Ole Gerster, aimless, 20-something, indebted slacker and law school
          drop-out Niko Fischer (Tom Schilling) was having multiple hardships
          on one pivotal day in his life. He suffered a breakup with his girlfriend
          Elli (Katharina Sch&uuml;ttler), lost his bank card in an ATM, was
          declared 'emotionally unstable' after a DUI by a state psychiatrist
          and thereby lost his license, was found to be lying for two years by
          his father, and failed at repeated attempts to have his morning coffee.
          The self-ironic dramedy became a love-letter to contemporary Berlin
          (constantly in transformation similar to Niko) as he wandered around
          its streets, almost oblivious to the fact that he was lost and out-of-place.
          In the final uncomfortable encounter of the film, Niko met an elderly
          drunk German man (Michael Gwisdek) (first named Friederich) with no
          relatives who had vivid memories of living under Nazi rule, but then
          collapsed and shortly later died in the hospital. This caused Niko
          to realize that he might need to change his aimless, disconnected drifting,
          when he finally was able to have a cup of coffee in a diner as the
          sun rose at dawn. </font></p></td>

          (2012)</a></b>, 164 minutes, D: Christopher Nolan<br />
          This was the concluding film of director Nolan's epic <i>Batman</i> trilogy,
          composed also of <i><a href="series-batman5.html">Batman Begins (2005)</a></i> and <i><a href="series-batman6.html">The
          Dark Knight (2008)</a></i>. Themes and characters were interwoven into
          the narrative from both previous
          <i>Batman</i> films. During the film, set eight
          years after the previous film, a new, gas-masked guerrilla-revolutionary
          anarchist Bane (Tom Hardy), a muscular ex-member of the League of Shadows,
          arrived to terrorize Gotham City, that had been mostly free of crime.
          After being trained by Ra's al Ghul (Liam Neeson), Bane's  mission
          was to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham. His criminal
          activities lured reclusive, and physically crippled billionaire-socialite
          Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) out of exile and hiding to resume
          his old vigilante role as Batman to save Gotham City from the threat
          of nuclear destruction. One of Bane's first crimes, working from his
          base in the city's sewers, was to attack the Gotham Stock Exchange
          and bankrupt Wayne Enterprises, with an ultimate objective to cut off
          Gotham from the rest of the world. Meanwhile, Wayne fell in love with
          his new acting CEO Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard). Bane was able to
          convert Wayne Enterprises' fusion reactor core-generator prototype
          into a decaying, unstable 4 megaton neutron bomb set to go off in a
          few months, while Batman was overpowered and captured by Bane and sent
          to an underground 'Hell on Earth' prison (a deep circular stone-wall
          shaft). Five months later, Bruce miraculously escaped from the prison
          shaft and was able to return to Gotham to protect the city and defeat
          Bane, with the aid of elusive cat burglar Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Anne
          Hathaway). During their conflict, Miranda stabbed Batman - revealing
          herself as Talia al Ghul, Ra's al Ghul's daughter (who as a child had
          escaped from the 'Hell on Earth' prison). She was seeking revenge for
          Batman's murder of her father. As Bane was about to kill Batman, the
          cunning Kyle saved him and mortally wounded Bane by blasting him with
          the Pod's large cannons. Talia died in the
          crash of the truck carrying the nuclear weapon. Batman was
          able to hoist the about-to-explode nuclear bomb with his sleek Bat
          aircraft away from the city to detonate it safely over the bay, while
          faking his own death. The film concluded with Batman having redeemed
          his former image to GCPD Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) (after
           also revealing his true identity), and the city was rebuilt in his
          memory as the heroic Dark Knight who had sacrificed himself. However,
          Wayne was discovered alive in Florence, Italy (by his trusted butler
          Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine)), seemingly retired with Kyle. Evidence
          suggested that Wayne/Batman had passed on access to the Batcave (through
          the contents of a duffel bag) to resigning GCPD rookie officer John
          Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - his legal first name was Robin!</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Django Unchained (2012)</b>, 166 minutes, D: Quentin
          Tarantino<br />
          Visionary writer/director Quentin Tarantino's violent, revisionist
          western slavery drama generally paid tribute to Italian 'spaghetti
          westerns.' It also specifically paid homage to and was influenced by
          director Sergio Corbucci's <i>Django
          (1966, It./Sp.) </i>starring
          Franco Nero in a breakout role as the title character - a coffin-dragging,
          blue-eyed cowboy-drifter gunslinger. [Note: Corbucci's film had purposely
          capitalized on the success of Sergio Leone's 'spaghetti western' <i>A
          Fistful of Dollars (1964, It./Sp.)</i> starring Clint Eastwood (in
          his first major film role), that itself was a 'remake' of Akira Kurosawa's <i>Yojimbo
          (1961, Jp.)</i>.] Tarantino's 'grindhouse' western was set in the Antebellum
          Deep South during the mid-1800s. In the film's plot, German-born dentist-turned-bounty
          hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) offered to purchase black
          slave Django (Jamie Foxx), in exchange for $75 dollars and his future
          freedom. Schultz's purchase was for the specific purchase of gaining
          Django's knowledge of his next bounty target - three outlawed Brittle
          brothers, overseers at the Tennessee plantation of Django's previous
          owner, Spencer &quot;Big
          Daddy&quot; Bennett (Don Johnson). After their successful first venture,
          Django and Schultz's next object was to rescue  Broomhilda &quot;Hildi&quot;
          von Shaft (Kerry Washington), Django's wife from a Mississippi plantation
          (named Candyland) owned by cruel and tyrannical taskmaster &quot;Monsieur&quot;
          Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). To gain access, their strategy
          was to pose as potential investors in a &quot;Mandingo&quot; fight racket. Candyland's
          slaves were often forced - gladiator-style - to wrestle to the death
          in  brutal fights. Their plan went awry when Candie's loyal house slave
          Stephen Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) learned that Hildi knew Django,
          and he alerted Candie about the deception. In a deadly altercation
          during a final purchase deal of $12,000 for Hildi, both Candie and
          Schultz were shot dead, and Django was forced to surrender when Stephen
          took Hildi as a hostage. Django avoided torture and death when Calvin's
          sister Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly (Laura Cayouette) interfered and sold
          him off to a mining company, but he soon escaped and returned to Candyland
          to seek vengeance. He freed Hildi, killed Lara, crippled Stephen with
          gunshot blasts to his knees, and dynamited the Candyland mansion with
          Stephen inside. </font></p>        </td>

          Director Peter Jackson's first installment in his three-part  adaptation
          of J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s 1937 novel <i>The Hobbit</i> was this fantasy
          epic adventure. Its two sequels in the trilogy were <i><a href="series-lordoftherings5.html">The

          Battle of the Five Armies (2014)</i></a> - all serving as prequels
          to the earlier-filmed, three part epic film franchise-series <i><a href="series-lordoftherings.html">The
          Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)</a></i>. Set in
          the fictional world of Middle-Earth, the film opened with 111 year-old
          hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman as young, Ian Holm as old) from
          the Shire telling his favorite nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) about his
          exploits many decades earlier, before the Fellowship of the Ring had
          been formed. As a young hobbit, Bilbo had been hired as a &quot;burglar&quot;
          by wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany exiled King
          Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and his company of 13 dwarves
          on a quest to reclaim their homeland, including the Kingdom of Erebor
          and the Lonely Mountain, that had been seized by the gold-hungry dragon
          Smaug (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch). The monstrous Smaug had destroyed
          the nearby town of Dale and had seized the dwarves' hoard of gold hidden
          in the mountain. Thorin's intent was to reclaim his birthright
          as King of the mountain from Smaug. For much of the lengthy film, their
          adventures were followed as they met many foes and obstacles, including
          Trolls, Stone Giants, and Goblins, but most notably Azog the Defiler
          (Manu Bennett) and his army of fiercesome Hunter Orcs. A side trip
          brought them to the peaceful sanctuary and Elven homeland of Rivendell
          where they were sheltered by Elven Lord Elrond (Hugh Weaving), and
          Gandalf was pledged support from co-ruler Galadriel (Cate Blanchett).
          During the journey, Bilbo encountered the treacherous Gollum (Andy
          Serkis) - a wretched, hobbit-like creature that had been corrupted
          by his discovery of the One Ring, forged at Mount Doom by the Dark
          Lord Sauron. Bilbo was able to pocket the Ring for himself. The film
          concluded as the group approached closer to Lonely Mountain where the
          sleeping dragon Smaug was awakened. </font></p>        </td>

          Ross<br />
          The basis of the 4 films in <i>The Hunger Games</i> franchise-series
          was author Suzanne Collins' best-selling series of young-adult science-fiction
          novels: <i>The Hunger Games (2008), Catching Fire (2009), </i>and<i> Mockingjay
          (2010)</i>. The books (and films) presented the futuristic, dystopian story
          of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), who sought to unify the 12
          Districts of the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in an effort to revolt
          and rebel against a tyrannical Capitol, led by totalitarian and ruthless
          President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland). This film was the first
          of a four-part theatrical film series, from 2012 to 2015. In the film's
          opening, an annual competition was held for 24 teenagers, when each
          of the 12 Districts was compelled to send a male and female 'tribute'
          (aged 12-18) to represent them and compete in the 74th Hunger Games.
          The brutal competition presented as entertainment for the masses, a
          government-sponsored fight to the death with only one survivor, was
          &quot;reality&quot;-televised to the nation. District 12 was represented by two
          tributes: 16 year-old Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), a childhood friend.
          While Peeta declared his true love for Katniss, she was also mentored
          by District 12's hard-drinking, troubled Haymitch Abernathy (Woody
          Harrelson), the District's only surviving past champion, and she also
          received hunting tips from her friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth).
          The games were headed by Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley), the Head Gamemaker.
          The fiercely capable but selfless young Katniss was forced to rely
          on sharp instincts, reflexes, and know-how to survive and overcome
          her opponents. A change in the rules mid-way in the death match by
          Crane allowed for there to be two winners provided they were from the

        <p><font size="2"><b>Life of Pi (2012)</b>, 127 minutes, D: Ang Lee<br />
          Director Ang Lee's meditative, coming-of-age, adventure-drama was based
              upon Canadian author Yann Martel's best-selling novel of the same
              name, published in 2001. The remarkable and emotionally-moving
              film was highlighted by its stunning visual-effects work and cinematography. The
              storyline set  told about the title character, Piscine
              &quot;Pi&quot; Patel ( (Irrfan Khan as adult), a Hindu Indian man and son
              of Santosh Patel (Adil Hussain), a local zoo-keeper, grew up in
              Pondicherry, India. He  related his incredible life story as
              a spiritual-minded, curious boy aged 11/12 (Ayush Tandon as boy)
              and at age 16 (Suraj Sharma as teenager) to an eager young novelist-writer
              (Rafe Spall) in Montreal, Canada. As a boy, he had adopted a hybrid
              faith, embracing three religions (Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam)
              in an effort to find and love God. When he joined his family to
              move to Winnipeg, Canada (with all of the exotic animals to be
              sold) on the Japanese freighter <i>Tsimtsum</i>, their ship experienced
              a fierce storm that caused a shipwreck that took the ship to the
              bottom of the ocean. Although the crew and all of his family drowned,
               Pi survived adrift on the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat stranded
               with some of the animals, including an injured zebra, an aggressive
               hyena, a friendly orangutan (Orange Juice), and a hungry, unpredictable
               Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Soon enough, all of the animals
               cannibalized each other, leaving the dominant Richard Parker alive.
               Pi relied on prayer for rescue and his own resourcefulness to
               fish and feed himself and the tiger so that he wouldn't be harmed.
               After a scary experience with an acidic, 'carnivorous' floating
               island with trees and meerkats, Pi reached the west coast of Mexico
               and parted from the tiger, who fled into the jungle. When questioned
               by insurance agents, Pi changed his story about what had actually
               happened, and replaced each of the animals with crew members and
               his own mother Gita (Tabu). In Pi's metaphoric second version
               of his story, he had become the adult Richard Parker. </font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Lincoln (2012)</b>, 149 minutes, D: Steven Spielberg<br />
          In Spielberg's great  political biopic and wartime costume drama with
              rich dialogue (including folksy homespun yarns, outhouse humor
              and parables spun by the title character), based upon Doris Kearns
              Goodwin's 2005 biographical book <i>Team
              of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</i>,
              Best Actor-winning Daniel Day-Lewis convincingly portrayed the
              16th US President who presided over the country from 1861 to 1865.
              It mostly concentrated on the final four months of his life in
              1865, when he faced divisive politics, ongoing family issues, and
              his own personal demons. It opened with President Abraham Lincoln's
              re-election in 1864, followed Lincoln's conflicts with Congress
              over passage of the 13th Amendment (to outlaw slavery and involuntary
              servitude in the Union), and the end to the bloody Civil War in
              1865. Lincoln's dilemma was whether the Amendment should be passed
              before or after the defeated Confederate states were readmitted
              and returned to the Union. There were rumors that a southern peace
              delegation had journeyed to Washington, DC, and was ready to discuss
              terms, although Lincoln kept stalling and denying their existence
              (to avoid postponing the amendment's vote) with a carefully-worded
              statement that the envoys were not <i>in
              Washington</i>. Lincoln was aided in his
              effort to end slavery by assistance from his trusted Secretary
              of State William Seward (David Strathairn). He also hired political
              negotiators, including Republican operative William N. Bilbo (James
              Spader) and his two lobbyist cronies: Democrat Richard Schell (Tim
              Blake Nelson), and Republican operative Col. Robert Latham (John
              Hawkes) to secure at least 20 votes from lame-duck House of Representatives'
          Democrats (most of whom staunchly opposed the amendment) to vote for
              the bill (in exchange for patronage positions or federal jobs -
              or greenbacks!). The political struggle was aided by uncompromising,
              Radical Republican abolitionist congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy
              Lee Jones) from Pennsylvania who staunchly believed in racial equality
              (and personally had a bi-racial housekeeper Lydia Smith), but in
              the end compromised by stating that he only believed in &quot;legal
              equality.&quot; The vote on the amendment passed by only two votes,
              but still needed ratification by the states. Arranged by Republican
              politician Francis Preston Blair (Hal Halbrook), Lincoln's subsequent
              meeting with the Confederate State officials failed, and the bloody
              war continued for a few more months. In early April of 1865, Lincoln
              - on horseback - was dismayed as he surveyed the carnage on the
              battlefield at Petersburg, Virginia. In
              the meantime in his own personal life, Lincoln faced further challenges
              from his fragile,  high-strung and emotionally-unstable
               First Lady wife Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) - nicknamed Molly,
              who was still grieving from the loss of her ill son Willie three
              years earlier, and was worried about the desperate wishes of son
              Robert Todd Lincoln (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to end his law school
              education and enlist in the Union Army before the war ended. (Lincoln
              was able to secure a less dangerous officer's commission and position
              for his son.) Only a few days after Confederate General Robert
              E. Lee's (Christopher Boyer) surrender to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant
              (Jared Harris) at the Appomattox Court House on April 9th of 1865,
              and Lincoln's planning to enfranchise blacks, Lincoln was assassinated
              while accompanying his wife to a performance at Ford's Theatre
              (off-screen). The news of his serious condition after being shot
              was relayed to young son Tad (Gulliver McGrath) who was attending
              a different children's play at nearby Grover's Theatre. Lincoln's
               death came a day later. The film concluded with a flashback excerpt
              to Lincoln's delivery of his March 4th, 1865 2nd Inaugural Address
              (with the famous sentence:
              &quot;With malice toward none, with charity for all&quot;). </font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Looper (2012)</b>, 118 minutes, D: Rian Johnson<br />
          Writer/director Rian Johnson's intelligent sci-fi thriller was a complex 
		  time-travel tale, with a central concept -  &quot;loopers&quot;
              were 'present-day' contract killers in the year 2074 hired by future-time
              criminal gangsters and syndicates to be sent back 30 years in time
              (to the year 2044) to terminate their enemies and leave no trace. The
        contract killer was hired to assassinate each of the mob's victims at
        a pre-arranged drop-off point, a remote corn/wheat field. In
        the story, 25 year-old Joe Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) lived in the year 2044
            in the burned-out, socially-decayed, dystopic metropolis of Kansas
            City. He was a low-level, yet specialized hitman (or &quot;looper&quot;)
          working with another fated fellow looper named Seth Richards (Paul
            Dano). Both loopers were hired by crime boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) in
            a Kansas syndicate. They had been sent back from 30 years into the
            future by controlling mastermind and mob boss Rainmaker to manage
            or run the loopers, and to close every single loop.
           Although time travel was to be invented in 30
          years, it was outlawed. Because of his fancy and lucrative lifestyle
          and career, young hedonistic Joe was able to afford fine retro clothes,
          a classic red Miata, and a fancy hooker/showgirl Suzie (Piper Perabo),
          who worked as a can-can dancer at Abe's nightclub &quot;La Belle Aurore.&quot; The
          main plot was that Joe suddenly found himself in a twisting situation
          where his next and final target was himself - his 30 years older self
          Old Joe (Bruce Willis). (He was to be disposed of by his 
          younger self. This would be a foolproof and clean method to eliminate
          the loopers (or close the loop) - and leave no trace.) It was revealed
          that Old Joe had been living a good life in the future - in Shanghai,
          China with a wife (Xu Qing). He had traveled back in time - to find
          and kill three kids born on the same day, one of whom would grow up
          to become the monstrous and vicious Rainmaker. Old Joe's reason to
          kill the 'young' Rainmaker was to save his own loving wife in the future.
          (Her death had been ordered by a man known only as &quot;The
          Rainmaker.&quot;) The younger Joe found himself in trouble with  his
            own mob boss and was in hiding at the remote Kansas farmhouse of
            devoted single-mother Sara Rollins (Emily Blunt), with a son named
            Cid (Pierce Gagnon). Joe suspected that Cid might be one of the children
            Old Joe thought was the Rainmaker, so he was there to protect Sara
          and her child. The mind-bending conclusion revealed that Cid was the
            Rainmaker. Joe realized that if Old Joe killed Sara, Cid's destiny
            would be disastrous, filled with anger and hatred. He would grow
            up to become the evil, vengeful Rainmaker, creating a closed time
          loop of murder and revenge. In the inevitable
          face-off shootout, to remedy and avert the situation, younger Joe suicidally
          shot himself to death in the heart to erase Old Joe's life, just as
          he was about to shoot Cid's mother. Old Joe immediately disappeared
          in front of Sara.</font></p>        </td>

          D: Joss Whedon<br />
          This escapist, action-oriented, blockbuster superhero adventure sci-fi
          film was the 6th film in the <a href="superheroes-marvel.html"><i>Marvel
          Cinematic Universe (MCU)</i></a>. Three sequels followed in fairly
          rapid succession: <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity
          War (2018), </i>and<i> Avengers: Endgame (2019)</i>. It was the highest-grossing
          (domestic) film of 2012. This first installment featured many of Marvel's
          comic-book characters who were brought together to stop the threat
          of Norse god Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) villainous adoptive brother Loki
          (Tom Hiddleston). The Asgardian Loki appeared on Earth to retrieve
          a mysterious artifact known as the Tesseract - a cosmic cube that contained
          an infinite energy source, a force that could subjugate the Earth and
          enslave humanity. The head of a secret, international peace-keeping
          spy organization known as S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick (Samuel L. Jackson) recruited
          various superheroes to save the planet and retrieve the stolen Tesseract,
          including Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk
          (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris
          Hemsworth), and skilled assassin and former Russian spy Natasha Romanoff/Black
          Widow (Scarlett Johansson), known collectively as The Avengers. Banner
          was given the task of tracking down the artifact's gamma radiation
          emissions as a signal to locate its whereabouts. One of the areas of
          dispute among the Avengers was S.H.I.E.L.D.'s plan to use the Tesseract
          to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extra-terrestrials.
          The conflict against Loki widened when he escaped from imprisonment
          and opened a wormhole above Stark Tower to allow the extra-terrestrial
          race of Chitauri to invade. The Avengers came together as a team of
          fighters to defend NYC from the Chitauri fleet's attack, while evacuating
          and saving citizens. Stark was able to intercept a nuclear missile
          aimed at midtown Manhattan that had been launched as a strike measure
          by the World Security Council, and he directed it through the open
          wormhole at the mothership of the Chitauri fleet to end the invasion.
          The film concluded with Loki being escorted to Asgard (with the Tesseract)
          by Thor, where Loki would stand trial for war crimes.</font></p>        </td>

          Anderson<br />
          Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's  well-crafted,
        visually-compelling, intelligent, R-rated psychological drama was controversial
          for its  similarities to the charismatic leader of the Church
          of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, author of the book <i>Dianetics: The
          Modern Science of Mental Health</i>. Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour
        Hoffman), a leader of a cultish religious movement known as &quot;The
        Cause&quot; (also the title of Dodd's first book) that preached self-fulfillment,
         attracted rogue drifter Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), a WWII US Navy
        veteran (with post-traumatic stress disorder). Freddie - a misfit and
        sex-obsessed loner and alcoholic (from a home-made moonshine potion composed
        of lethal paint thinner), suffered from drastic
        mood-swings, but was accepted into Dodd's movement and taken under the
        'Master's' wing. Freddie began to travel with Dodd's family, including
        his wife Peggy Dodd (Amy Adams) who became extremely wary of Freddie.
        Dodd's technique for his followers involved &quot;processing&quot; sessions, repetitive
        questioning and testing that were designed to clear out one's emotions
        through confession, to cleanse one's internal wounds. Meanwhile,
        Dodd was coming under scrutiny for illegally practicing medicine, while
        the skeptical and self-destructive Freddie was also doubting Dodd's saving
        abilities and teachings - calling him fake. In the final scene, Dodd
        delivered an ultimatum to Freddie - remain devoted with The Cause forever,
        or leave and never return, and Freddie chose the latter. </font></p>        </td>

          The long-running beloved 1980 French musical <i>Les Miserables</i> (with
          many film and other stage adaptations) was chosen by director Tom Hooper
          for this lavish, epic-period musical drama, based upon French author
          Victor Hugo's 1862 French novel. The story of revolution and redemption
          followed the basic plotline of many other productions. Set during a
          period of rebellion in France in the early 19th century, released prisoner
          after 19 years of incarceration Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) worked
          for many years in  a respectable job as a factory owner and mayor
          of Montreuil in N. France, while keeping his past a secret. He was
          shocked to learn that the new police chief-inspector Javert (Russell Crowe), a former
          prison guard (at the Toulon prison where Valjean had been held) was
          now in fervent pursuit of him for earlier breaking his parole. At his
          work, Valjean  agreed to care for Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), the illegimate daughter of one
          of his struggling ex-factory workers Fantine (Anne Hathaway) who had
          turned to prostitution after being fired from her job (for being an
          unwed mother) and soon after died of a terminal case of TB. Valjean
          paid off Cosette's caretakers  the Th&eacute;nardiers
          (Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen), a corrupt and greedy
          couple who were innkeepers, in order to adopt and care for the girl.
          When Cosette grew up, she began a passionate romance with student revolutionary
          Marius Pontmercy (Eddie Redmayne), who was a member of the rebel group
          &quot;Friends of the ABC.&quot; Marius was joined by two others in the rebellion: 
		  Enjolras (Aaron Tveit) and street urchin Gavroche (Daniel Huttlestone). Another female was also
          secretly in love with Marius - the Thenardiers' daughter &Eacute;ponine
          (Samantha Barks). During the growing revolution, &Eacute;ponine
          was shot and died in a gunfight and perished in Marius' arms, while
          Valjean joined the student rebels to save Marius's life from government
          troops, and barely made it out alive himself. Valjean was given the
          chance to execute the captured Javert, but declined to kill him. The
          morally-conflicted Javert, who also later caught Valjean but then let him
          go, committed suicide by hurling himself into the Seine River. After
          the wedding of Marius and Cosette, Valjean died peacefully in a local
          convent from a heart-condition, with the married couple by his side.</font></p>        </td>

          Co-writer/director Wes Anderson's quirky coming-of-age comedy-drama
          was set in the mid-1960s on New Penzance, a fictional New England island.

          Gilman), attending a Khaki Scout camp known as Camp Ivanhoe at Fort
          Lebanon, went missing. The possibly emotionally-disturbed young boy
          left a note for his Troop 55's Scoutmaster Randy Ward (Edward Norton)
          that he had voluntarily resigned. The unpopular Sam felt alienated
          from both his peers and his guardians and had decided to flee, with
          a canoe and some supplies. The island's local police chief Captain
          Duffy Sharp (Bruce Willis) organized a search party of scouts, and
          his foster parents Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Billingsley (Larry Pine and
          Liz Callahan) were notified. At the same time, married lawyers Walt

          Hayward) was missing. [Note: Laura was engaged in an affair with Captain
          Sharp.] They also discovered that she had been engaged in a secret
          pen-pal correspondence relationship with Sam for about a year. The
          two had met backstage in 1964 during a production of &quot;Noye's
          Fludde&quot; at St. Jack's Church on the neighboring island of St.
          Jack Wood. Suzy had performed as a costumed Raven  on biblical Noah's
          Ark in the play. Apparently, the two like-minded, unhappy outcasts/lovers
          and soulmates had planned to runaway and rendezvous weeks earlier at
          an isolated beach or cove (later named
          Moonrise Kingdom). Unbeknownst to them, a violent storm
          was brewing off the New England coast and threatening a monumental
          flood, as the two tweens were being tracked by the scouts and other
          authorities. At the cove, Sam and Suzy camped, talked, went swimming,
          and experienced their first feelings of romance (including a kiss).
          After the pair was apprehended the next morning, Suzy was taken home,
          while Sam was awaiting a representative (Tilda Swinton) of &quot;Social
          Services&quot; to take him to a &quot;juvenile refuge&quot; since he could no longer
          live with his foster parents. There was talk of electro-shock therapy
          treatment. Sam's former Khaki Scout enemies had a change of heart and
          decided to rescue the pair - they reunited Suzy with Sam at a larger
          Khaki Scouts camp (known as Hullaballoo) on St. Jack Wood Island at
          Fort Lebanon, staffed by Cousin Ben (Jason Schwartzman). Ben performed
          an impromptu and unofficial 'wedding' for the two, but again 
          they were forced to flee off the Hullaballoo premises with various
          adult figures and some of the Scouts in pursuit. Meanwhile, the raging
          hurricane struck, and during its fury, Captain Sharp resolved himself
          to become Sam's legal guardian so that he could remain on New Penzance
          Island and keep in contact with Suzy.</font></p>        </td>

          This emotional, independent  erotic drama was based on the true story
              of Mark O'Brien, based on his 1990 article &quot;On Seeing a Sex
              Surrogate.&quot; It was a compassionate look at the issues of engaging
              in sexual behavior for those who were disabled. Living in Berkeley,
              CA in 1988, 38 year-old poet and journalist Mark (John Hawkes)
              was forced to exist for 20 hours a day in an iron lung due to a
              severe childhood case of polio. With a curved spine, he was paralyzed
              from the neck down. He proposed to his pretty student caretaker
              Amanda (Annika Marks), but she could not reciprocate his feelings
              and was scared away. Fearing that he was near death, but had never
              experienced sex or love, the devout Catholic contacted his spiritual
              counselor and unconventional, long-haired priest Father Brendan
              (William H. Macy) for a consultation and was allowed permission
              to have sex therapy. He was referred to hands-on 'sex surrogate'
              Cheryl Cohen Greene (Helen Hunt), a married mother with a
              Massachusetts accent, to help him lose his virginity and discover
              sex. For each therapy session, assistant Vera (Moon Bloodgood)
              wheeled Mark to her at a motel. Only six therapy &quot;sessions&quot; were
              allowed in order to avoid having him develop an emotional attachment
              to her. However, after intimate body awareness sessions and sexual
              contact, and the loss of his virginity, it was clear that they
              were both developing romantic and emotional feelings and attachments
              for each other, and the sessions had to be cut short. Cheryl's
              husband Josh (Adam Arkin) was becoming uncomfortable with her transformational
              encounters with her client. The film ended with Mark's funeral
              attended by the important women in his life, including Cheryl.</font></p></td>

          D: David O. Russell<br />
          Writer/director David O. Russell's offbeat dramedy was based upon Matthew
          Quick's 2008 novel of the same name. It told  
          the story of troubled patient Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Solitano, Jr. (Bradley
          Cooper) living in Ridley Park, PA (in Upper Darby township of Delaware
          Co.). Due to a plea bargain after violently beating up his ex-wife
          Nikki's (Brea Bee) lover, he was sent to the Baltimore, MD Karel Psychiatric
          Facility where he was diagnosed with bi-polar depression. When
          released after about 8 months, he moved back into his childhood home
          with his parents, a part-time illegal bookie Patrizio Solitano, Jr.
          (Robert DeNiro) and Dolores (Jacki Weaver), and was attending required
          therapy sessions with Indian Dr. Cliff Patel (Anupam Kher). Although
          he had anger issues, Pat was attempting to rebuild his shattered life,
          and live a more optimistic lifestyle with the mantra: Look for the
          good (or silver linings) in everything. His father was a devotedly-obsessed
          Philadelphia Eagles football fan mixed with problems of OCD (obsessive-compulsive-disorder)
          and gambling. The determined Pat had two goals: to get his old substitute
          teaching job back, and to reconcile and win back his ex-spouse Nikki,
          but she had a restraining order on him. At dinner with friends Ronnie
          (John Ortiz) and his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), he met her sister
          - a depressed, unemployed young widow Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence)
          who also suffered mental imbalances and was still mourning her husband's
          death. One of her issues was the need to compulsively offer herself
          for sex. She offered to deliver a letter to Nikki for
          Pat - in exchange for him becoming her partner in an upcoming local
          dance competition. During their training together, they established
          a growing rapport, but also exhibited a  love/hate relationship
          for each other. The film came to a climax on the day of both the dance
          competition and a big game between the Eagles and Dallas, when Veronica
          unexpectedly brought Nikki to the dance theatre. Fearing that she would
          lose Pat to Nikki, Tiffany (who had forged a letter from Nikki to Pat)
          retreated to the bar for two stiff drinks, but then was coaxed onto
          the dance floor with Pat to perform their number. Two objectives were
          met that evening: they scored 5 out of 10 in the competition, and the
          Eagles won the football game. Pat expressed his enduring love for Tiffany
          when she jealously stormed off (after viewing him and Nikki together),
          and Pat, Sr. used his windfall profits from gambling over the game
          to open a restaurant.</font></p>        </td>

          145 minutes, D: Sam Mendes<br />
          This was the  23rd film in the series after a long four year gap
          since the last film, and the third film with now 44-year-old blue-eyed
          Daniel Craig as 007 agent James Bond. This thrilling, violent, action-oriented
          spy movie presented a daring deconstruction of the James Bond role
          and all its accompanying iconography, with some throwback-tributes
          to legendary elements in the franchise. The film opened with a near-death
          experience for Bond working in Istanbul, Turkey with assistant
          MI6 field agent Eve (Moneypenny) (Naomie Harris).  Meanwhile, Bond's
          superior M (Judi Dench), the head of MI6, was having her abilities
          and competence repeatedly questioned by rising Chairman of the Intelligence
          and Security Committee Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). At the same
          time, there was a devastating attack on MI6 headquarters in London.
          Miraculously alive, Bond returned to London where he was commissioned
          by M to find the mastermind behind the attacks and additional subterfuge.
          A new threat was in the offing - the revelation  on the Internet
          of the identities (5 at a time) of undercover NATO agents embedded
          in terrorist organizations worldwide. Bond  met
          with Q (Ben Whishaw), MI6's young new quartermaster, to acquire requisite
          gadgets. He then traveled to Shanghai, CH where he met S&eacute;v&eacute;rine
          (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe), the cyber-terrorist
          mastermind's associate and mistress. He was led to her employer - the
          twisted and sadistic villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former
          MI6 operative, who had vengefully planned the London attack. His dastardly
          plan was to seek revenge against M for a past injustice (betrayal and
          abandonment in 1997, followed by torture and disfigurement) when he
          worked for the Secret Service in Hong Kong with her in the 1980s-90s.
          Silva would cause a scandal through breaches of security that would
          force her resignation, as part of his plot to kill her. The film concluded
          at Bond's childhood home located at Skyfall (in the Scottish Highlands),
          where M, Bond and estate gamekeeper Kincade (Albert Finney) set up
          booby traps to prepare for an expected attack by Silva and his men.
          During a face-to-face confrontation between M and Silva, Bond threw
          a knife into Silva's back to kill him, but M died of an earlier bullet
          wound in Bond's arms. </font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Zero Dark Thirty (2012)</b>, 157 minutes, D: Kathryn
          Bigelow<br />
          Director Kathryn Bigelow's political-action war-time thriller and docu-drama
          told the story of the US government's  years-long, step-by-step, procedural
          worldwide man-hunt for international terrorist Osama bin Laden after
          the 9/11 Al Qaeda attacks in September of 2001. It was regarded as
          controversial for its realistic (and condemning) depiction of the torture
          practice of water-boarding on detainees. Rookie CIA agent-operative
          Maya Harris (Jessica Chastain) - a fictional character, working in
          Pakistan in 2003 with colleague Dan Fuller (Jason Clarke) at a CIA
          black site, reluctantly witnessed the torture of one of bin Laden's
          associates Ammar (Reda Kateb) (a nephew?) during an approved act of
          water-boarding. It was interrogation tactic to acquire intelligence
          and information about his whereabouts. Over a period of years, she
          became single-mindedly focused on pursuing leads to find the elusive
          terrorist mastermind, even after the deaths of some of her co-workers.
          Her dedication led to quite a few dead ends and false leads, but she
          was nonetheless determined and driven to persevere. She came upon old,
          indistinct and tentative information about the location of bin Laden's
          hiding place (through the identity of his courier Abu Ahmed) in urban
          Abbottabad, Pakistan, and was able to finally convince higher-ups to
          launch a strike with an elite force. In the final half hour of the
          film, the action sequence of the raid, Bin Laden (Ricky Sekhon) met
          his death in his Pakistan compound at the hands of an intricately-planned
          raid by Navy SEALs Team 6, on May 2, 2011.</font></p>
