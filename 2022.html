        <p><font size="2"><b>Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),</b> 192 minutes,
          D: James Cameron <br />
        Writer/director James Cameron's long-awaited, visually-astounding, CGI
        sci-fi action-epic sequel to the 2009 original film, was again set about
        a decade later on the distant extra-solar planet of Pandora. Former military
        recruit Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) was living an idyllic and happy
        life amongst the Na'vi race with
        his partner Neytiri (Zoe Salda&ntilde;a) 
        and their young family (three children of their own plus adopted miracle
        daughter Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) of comatose Na'vi avatar Grace
        Augustine from the first film). They also raised a teenaged human boy
        named Spider (Jack Champion), the son of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen
        Lang). Peace was disrupted when vengeful members of the Resources Development
        Administration (RDA) from the first film, led by a revived Colonel Quaritch
        in Recombinant form (he was cloned into a Na'vi body with his memories
        uploaded from before his death), returned on a colonization mission that
        threatened the people. To protect their peaceful planet, Jake and
        Neytiri allied themselves with the Na'vi army. Jake was targeted as a
        rebel leader (as chief of the Omaticaya clan) when he attempted
        to save the inhabitants. During Col. Quaritch's mission, he took his
        own son Spider captive during which time he learned about the Na'vi culture.
        Fearing for their safety, Jake gave up his chief's position and took
        his family to dwell with the Na'vi of the sea (the Metkayina clan of
        reef people) on Pandora's eastern seaboard, led by clan chief Tonowari
        (Cliff Curtis) and his free-diving wife Ronal (Kate Winslet). Jake's
        adopted daughter Kiri became spiritually bonded with the aquatic life
        of Metkayina, while their second son Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) befriended
        the chieftain's daughter Tsireya or &quot;Reya&quot; (Bailey Bass). Eventually,
        Col. Quaritch tracked the Sully family to the reef people's archipelago
        inhabited by indigenous tribes, leading to a final confrontation between
        Quaritch's human invaders and Jake's family members. </font></p>        </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Babylon (2022),</b> 189 minutes, D: Damien Chazelle<br />
        Writer/director Damien Chazelle's frenzied, fast-paced historical drama
            with an ensemble cast chronicled the madcap magic and the excesses
            of Hollywood and Tinseltown showbiz in the late &quot;Roaring&quot; 1920s
            as it transitioned into the &quot;talkie&quot; sound
            era. The zany  and decadent odyssey followed the tumultuous and dynamic
            time period amongst individuals at the fictional Kinoscope Studios,
            that resulted in unruly film sets, reckless drug use, and depraved
            and perverse drug-drenched orgies, seen in the opening scene in
            1926 set in the mansion of  studio executive Don Wallach (Jeff
            Garlin). Both historical and fictional characters experienced personal
            triumphs and despair when caught up in the rise and downfall of &quot;Babylon.&quot;
            The diverse cast included ambitious, wannabe NJ starlet and hedonistic &quot;It-Girl&quot;
            Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) (inspired by Clara Bow),  Mexican immigrant-assistant
            Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Torres (Diego Calva) who was able to survive
             the chaotic and uncaring time period of the 'studio system,' aging,
            hedonistic, recently-divorced silent film matinee idol Jack Conrad
            (Brad Pitt) (and Nellie's love interest), seductive Chinese-American,
            lesbian cabaret entertainer Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li),  talented
            African-American jazz-trumpet musician Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo),
            and mob boss James McKay (Tobey Maguire). With the rise of sound
            films and the demise of the &quot;Old
            Hollywood,&quot; troubled and despairing 
            Jack Conrad suicidally shot himself, and self-destructive Nellie
            was also found dead in a hotel room at the age of 34. Sensationalist
            gossip tabloid writer Elinor St. John (Jean Smart) commented on Conrad's
            life (similar to the fate that befell silent film star John Gilbert).
            The film concluded with a series of vignettes (presented as a montage
            of cinematic history) from numerous 20th century films ranging from
            the silent era to the current era.</font></p></td>

        Aran Islands. The film was set against the backdrop of the Irish Civil
        War in the early 1920s. When Colm suddenly and abruptly ended their strong
        relationship bond by ignoring Padraic, his friend became completely destabilized
        and distressed by the change. Padraic's sister Siobhan (Kerry Condon)
        and young islander Dominic (Barry Keoghan) vainly attempted to repair
        the relationship. The situation intensified after the troubled Colm carried
        through on a gruesome threatened ultimatum, and cut off one of his own
        left fingers with a pair of sheep shears. During their escalating conflict,
        Colm announced that he had finished the composition of his folk song
        titled: &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin,&quot; but then cut off his remaining left
        fingers with the shears and threw them at the door of Padraic's cottage.
        The life-threatening feud (possibly brought on by banshees) enveloped
        the whole village. Further dire, life-changing consequences included
        the death of Padraic's pet miniature donkey named Jenny (after eating
        one of the fingers and choking to death), and Padraic's burning down
        of Colm's home - with his friend inside the flaming structure (although
        Padraic saved Colm's dog by leading him to safety). Later, Colm appeared
        alive on the beach and apologized to Padraic for everything - hoping
        that their feud was over, but Padriac responded to his former friend
        that the feud would only have ended if he had remained inside his burning
        house. Colm ended the film by thanking Padraic for saving his dog: (&quot;P&aacute;draic.
        Thanks for lookin' after me dog for me, anyways&quot;), and Padraic responded:
        &quot;Anytime.&quot; </font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)</b>, 161 minutes,
      D: Ryan Coogler<br />
      Co-writer and director Ryan Coogler's sequel followed up on his spectacularly
      popular
      <i>Black Panther (2018)</i> - it was the 30th entry in <a href="superheroes-marvel.html"><i>Marvel's
      Cinematic Universe</i></a>. In the film's opening, it told  about
      the nation of Wakanda that was deep in mourning after the unexpected loss
      of their King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman, who tragically passed away after
      completing the original film). The King's Princess-sister Shuri (Letitia
      Wright) was deeply guilt-ridden by her brother's loss, and a year later
      admitted to her mother - Sovereign Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) - that
      she was unwilling to create a new Wakandan king with her 'heart-shaped
      herb.' The Wakandan kingdom was being threatened, due to its leadership
      vacuum, and its stockpile of valuable vibranium. In the world of Talokan (of
      Meso-American origin) inhabited by blue-skinned, water-breathing, underwater-dwelling
      superhumans, its angry and hateful submariner King Namor (Tenoch
      Huerta Mej&iacute;a) vied for power. He issued an ultimatum to the Queen
      and Shuri, who were struggling to protect T'Challa's legacy
      and their kingdom. He demanded that they surrender the scientist responsible
       for a vibranium-detecting device, or he would attack Wakanda. The scientist
       - later revealed to be MIT student Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne), 
        was visited in Cambridge, Mass. by Shuri and Okoye (Danai Gurira), the
      general of Wakanda's all-female force  (the Dora Milaje). Okoye was
      unable to protect Shuri and Williams who were subsequently captured by
      King Namor, and she was stripped of her duties by the Queen. Namor again
      proposed an alliance with Wakanda while threatening the kingdom's destruction
      if he was denied power. When Shuri and Williams escaped with the help of
      Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Namor attacked Wakanda, resulting in Ramonda's
      death by drowning while saving Williams. The people of Wakanda were forced
      to retreat to the Jabari mountains for safety. Shuri ingested her miraculous
      herb and was transformed into a new superhuman Black Panther to lead the
      Wakandans. She was encouraged by Erik &quot;Killmonger&quot; (Michael B. Jordan)
      to seek revenge for her mother Ramonda's death by ordering an attack on
      King Namor's Talokanils. Shuri's forces were bolstered by a new Dora Milaje
      warrior-leader named Ayo (Florence Kasumba), Okoye (now donned with special
      armor), and a new Dora Milaje recruit named Aneka (Michaela Coel). The
      film concluded with a short battle between Shuri and Namor, resulting in
      Namor's surrender (Shuri spared his life) and the establishment of a peaceful
      alliance between them. In the middle of the end credits, Shuri discovered
       that Nakia and T'Challa had a son named Toussaint who was being raised
       in secret by Nakia - and Toussaint's Wakandan name was T'Challa.</font></p>      </td>

      <p><b><font size="2">Elvis (2022),</font></b> <font size="2">159 minutes,
      D: Baz Luhrmann<br />
      Director and co-scripter Luhrmann's dramatized, glitzy musical biopic of
       Elvis Presley charted the life of the rock 'n' roll singer and movie star
      icon from his childhood and into the 1950s and 1960s, until his untimely
      death at the age of 42 in 1977. The semi-documentary (or
      biographical) film, told as a flashback, portrayed the complex relationship
      between Presley and his manager/huckster Colonel Tom Parker (Tom Hanks),
      who often financially exploited Elvis, and provided his point-of-view for
      the storyline. As the film opened, the destitute and stroke-ridden Parker
      was on his deathbed in a Las Vegas hospital in January 1997, as he reminisced
      about his two decades  with Presley. Young
      Elvis (Chaydon Jay as boy) grew up as a poor and humble white boy in the
      shantytown of Tupelo, MS, raised by his mother Gladys (Helen Thomson).
      He spent much of his time reading Captain Marvel Jr. (Shazam) comic books
      and dreaming of a better future. After the family moved to Memphis, TN,
      Elvis (Austin Butler as adult) became interested in the city's African-American
       music (on Beale Street), including blues, country and gospel songs. He
      was entranced by BB King (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) and Big Mama Thornton (Shonka
      Dukureh), who sang &quot;Hound Dog.&quot; Although
        Colonel Parker was country-western singer Hank Snow's (David Wenham)
          agent, he quickly 'discovered' and recognized the promise of the sexy,
      rebellious, and talented Presley in 1955, and offered him fame and fortune
      if they partnered together. Presley became a controversial figure, due
      to many parents' fears that the indecent singer would corrupt their children
      (with his hip-gyrating RnR dance moves, giving him the nickname &quot;Elvis
      the Pelvis&quot;) and enflame racial divisions and hostility. The film
      followed Presley's life, including his stint in the US Army in the early
      60s, his mother's death from alcoholism, his love/hate of alleged con-man
      Parker, his burgeoning movie career (beginning with <i>Love Me Tender (1956)</i>),
      and his relationship with the love of his life Priscilla Wagner (Olivia
      DeJonge), marrying in 1967 and producing a daughter named Lisa Marie. His
      larger-than-life fame carried him to TV specials, concert tours, and five
      years of performances in Las Vegas, all highly-regulated and controlled
      by Colonel Parker. Personal health problems and Elvis' drug-induced and
      alcoholic addictions led to a divorce from Priscilla in 1973, and his threatened
      firing of manager Parker. There were squabbles over finances, and fewer
      shows due to Presley's physical condition (obesity and drug dependency).
      His final live appearances in mid-1977 were only weeks before his death
      at his Memphis' Graceland home. </font></p>      </td>

            minutes, D: Dan Kwan, Daniel Scheinert </font><br />
      <font size="2">This free-wheeling, frenetic, domestic
      drama and comedy (with overwhelming sci-fi and fantasy elements), A24's
      independent film, was co-written and co-directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel
      Scheinert. The unpredictable film opened with  the daily struggles of a
      middle-aged, unfulfilled Chinese-American immigrant Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh)
      who managed a laundromat. Crucial events in Evelyn's life were threatening
      to change the course of her life forever: (1) an IRS office appointment
      for an audit of her business (with cruel bureaucratic clerk Deidre Beaubeirdre
      (Jamie Lee Curtis)), (2)  a troubled marriage and an impending divorce
      (and the serving of divorce papers) from her eternally optimistic, loveable
      and meek husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), (3) a difficult relationship with
      her adult daughter Joy Wang (Stephanie Hsu), who was hopeful that her lesbian,
            non-Chinese girlfriend Becky (Tallie Medel) would be accepted by
            Evelyn and others, and (4) an upcoming Chinese New Year celebration 
			at the same time that her demanding,
      reactionary Chinese father Gong Gong (James Hong) had arrived for a visit. In
      her stressed life, Evelyn discovered that
          she had the ability to connect and traverse through time and space
          into parallel timelines, universes and worlds (metaverses). Throughout
          her entire life's journey, her various individual decisions 
          had created a new alternate universe (or Alphaverse), and within those various multiverses,
      Evelyn enacted or realized versions of herself (e.g., a martial arts
        kung-fu master, a movie star, etc). She   
        learned and become aware of the various other universes that would have
        been available to her if she had made different choices in her life. She
        discovered that she was able to access skills, memories, and bodies of
        her parallel universe counterparts. Evelyn also found the power to prevent
        another powerful being from destroying the multiverse - she engaged in
        an existential battle with a threatening, nihilistic force known as Jobu
        Tupaki - the Alphaverse version of Evelyn's adult daughter Joy Wang. Ultimately,
          she contemplated entering the 'black hole' of an <i>everything bagel</i> -
          a certain death sentence for her and Jobu that would end all her multiverse
          lives. However, she reversed course after Waymond's pleas for her to
          seek reconciliation and peace, and decided to embrace every version
          of herself to save the multiverse. As the film concluded back in
          Evelyn's home universe, Gong Gong learned of Becky's true relationship
          with Joy, Evelyn worked with the IRS tax agent to refile their taxes,
          and she reconciled and was reunited with both Waymond and Joy, although
          she was momentarily tempted to return to the multiverse. The film's
          premise was clear in its ending - Evelyn realized the very real importance
        of her family and its interconnections. </font></p>        </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>The Fabelmans (2022)</b>, 151 minutes, D: Steven Spielberg<br />
      This semi-autobiographic, coming-of-age family drama was based upon director
          Spielberg's own upbringing in post-war New Jersey (until 1957), 
           suburban Phoenix, AZ, and two locales in N. and S. California (from
          age 7 to 18), where he lived with his Jewish, dysfunctional parents:
          computer engineer Burt Fabelman (Paul Dano) and gifted concert pianist
          mother Mitzi (Michelle Williams). As Sammy Fabelman (Mateo Francis-DeFord
          and Gabriel LaBelle), the young adolescent boy developed a love for
          the story-telling power of the movies after viewing Cecil B. DeMille's
          extravagant, Best Picture-winning
          <i>The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)</i> with its climactic railroad
          train crash scene. The inventive young 'Sammy' began his film-making
          career by creating 8mm home movies, beginning with a re-creation of
          the train crash. He also was involved in making short  films with
          his Boy Scout troop, and interactions with his family (including his
          three sisters Reggie (Birdie Borria/Julia Butters), Natalie (Alina
          Brace/Keeley Karsten), and Lisa (Sophia Kopera)), and friends (including
          Burt's best friend &quot;Uncle&quot; Bennie
          Loewy (Seth Rogen), a surrogate uncle for Sammy). During a family vacation
          camping trip, Sammy happened to capture footage that suggested an unsettling
          family secret - that Mitzi had romantic feelings for Bennie. Sammy's
          first major film production was a war film with lots of dead and bloodied
          soldiers. After another move to Saratoga, CA, Sammy was confronted
          with anti-Semitic abuse from two HS students, jocks Logan (Sam Rechner)
          and Chad (Oakes Fegley), who called him &quot;Bagelman.&quot;  He began dating
          pretty classmate Monica Sherwood (Chloe East), a devout Christian girl,
          who encouraged him to film &quot;Senior Ditch Day&quot; at the Santa Cruz beach,
          and joined him as his prom date. The open revelation of Mitzi's adulterous
          relationship with Bennie led to the divorce of Sammy's parents, and
          Mitzi's return to Phoenix. After the breakup, Sammy lived with his
          father Burt in Hollywood, where he continued his journey into film-making
          that enabled him to create escapist worlds that were preferable to
          his own crumbling family situation. Two experiences solidified Sammy's
          love of the movies - an offer by CBS-TV to work on the <i>Hogan's
          Heroes</i> sitcom,
          and a short, nerve-wracking mentoring session (about the importance
          of the horizon line) with famed, eye-patched, cigar-smoking film director
          John Ford (director David Lynch in a cameo) in his Paramount Pictures
          studio office. </font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>T&aacute;r (2022),</b> 158 minutes, D: Todd Field<br />
        Writer/director Todd Field's provocative, meticulously-created R-rated
            classical musical drama told about the rise and fall of the title
            character - Lydia T&aacute;r
        (Cate Blanchett) - a prestigious, commanding composer and orchestra director
        who became one of the most highly respected conductors in Berlin, Germany.
        As a child, she was a piano prodigy, and in her early career became a
        guest lecturer at the Julliard music school. Continually over-praised,
            she made history as the first female conductor of a major German
            symphonic orchestra, and became known as one of the greatest living
            composers and conductors of all time. The arthouse film's authenticity
            was enhanced by the score performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.
            Her domestic life included a lesbian lifestyle with a sickly female
            wife- partner named Sharon Goodnow (Nina Hoss) - who played first
            chair violin in Lydia's orchestra, and an adopted daughter from Syria
            named Petra. One of the egotistical Lydia's persistent personality
            shortcomings and faults (dirty secrets) throughout her career was
            her manipulative, abusive and exploitative moves toward various attractive
            females. Two incidents suggested her transactional, sexual favoritism
            toward Krista Taylor (Sylvia Flote), a former fellowship program
            member (who later committed suicide), and young Russian cellist Olga
            Metkina (Sophie Kauer). Lydia's assistant conductor Sebastian Brix
            (Allan Corduner) confronted Lydia about her facade and unbalanced
            behavior and was faced with threats of being replaced, possibly by
            Lydia's attentive, long-suffering personal assistant Francesca Lentini
            (No&eacute;mie Merlant). Circumstances spun out of control for Lydia when she was
            posthumously sued by a lawsuit from Krista and her parents, and a
            damning <i>New York
        Post</i> article was published and described allegations against her.
        Her world-class reputation and steely power were being challenged during
        the live recording of her latest symphonic performance of Gustav Mahler's <i>Symphony
        No. 5</i>, and she was promptly removed
        as conductor. During the recording session in New York, however, Lydia
        barged in and attacked her replacement amateur conductor Elliot Kaplan
        (Mark Strong). With her life in shambles, she returned to her lower-class
        childhood home on Staten Island, where it was revealed that her birth
        name was actually Linda Tarr. Later, she was seen conducting an orchestra
        in Southeast Asia for the score of a Japanese video game series known
        as <i>Monster Hunter</i>, where she also frequented a massage parlor/brothel.</font></p>      </td>

          <font size="2">This social history and biographical drama, from Nigerian
          born writer-director Chinonye Chukwu, told the true story of 14 year-old
          son Emmett Louis Till (Jalyn Hall) (aka &quot;Bobo&quot;) who was brutally beaten
          and lynched in Money, Mississippi in 1955 by white supremacists during
              a visit with his cousins. His loving, overprotective 
              single mother Mamie Till-Mobley (Danielle Deadwyler), whose husband
              died during WWII, had been reluctantly persuaded by her mother
          Alma Carthan (Whoopi Goldberg) to  allow her son (by himself)
          to take the train southward from their middle-class home in Chicago
          for a visit with relatives. In the southern town, Emmett visited a
          local store where he wolf-whistled at married white shopkeeper Carolyn
          Bryant (Haley Bennett). As a result, her racist husband Roy Bryant
          (Sean Michael Weber) and his co-worker JW Milam (Eric Whitten) viciously
          dragged Emmett from the home of his preacher-cousin Moses Wright (John
          Douglas Thompson) and lynched him (off-screen). After
          her son's cold-blooded death, the courageous Mamie allowed an open-casket
          funeral back in Chicago for the public to witness the horror of her
          boy's brutalized treatment. In the emotionally-told tale about the
          emergent civil rights movement through her activism and point-of-view,
          the drama then followed her long and tireless struggle to seek and
          pursue justice for her murdered son. During a sham court trial,  
           the accused murderers were found not guilty by 
          an all-white jury. After the trial in the following year, Milam and
          Bryant - for $4,000 from a magazine - confessed to the murder against
          Emmett, but due to the double jeopardy rule, could not
          be prosecuted. As a result of Mamie's activist efforts, however, a
          federal anti-lynching law was finally passed - 67 years after her son
          was murdered during the horrendous hate crime.</font></p>      </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Top Gun: Maverick (2022)</b>, 130 minutes, D:
      Joseph Kosinski<br />
      After thirty years following the original film <i>Top Gun (1986)</i>, top
      Naval aviator Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell
      (Tom Cruise) was still proving and demonstrating his anti-authoritarian,
      insubordinate attitude and courageous and daring skills as a test pilot.
      His luck was supplemented by supportive US Commander of the Pacific Fleet
      - Admiral Tom &quot;Iceman&quot; Kazansky
      (Val Kilmer) (with a case of terminal throat cancer), who functioned as
      his guardian angel and protected him from multiple threats of being grounded.
      A turning point in his life - and a reminder of his past life - came when
      he was called upon by Kazansky to train a new generation of fliers. A dozen
      elite Top Gun graduates were assembled by Air Boss Vice Admiral Beau &quot;Cyclone&quot; Simpson
      (Jon Hamm) to engage in a specialized secret (and
      suicidal) mission to destroy a remote military facility and bunker that
      housed an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant. Admiral
      &quot;Cyclone&quot; Simpson thought that the mission would succeed, but would still
      suffer  &quot;acceptable losses.&quot; The
          trainees included Lt. Bradley &quot;Rooster&quot; Bradshaw (Miles Teller), 
          the son of Maverick's late friend - Radar Intercept Officer Lt.
          Nick &quot;Goose&quot; Bradshaw. During deliberations about the mission, Maverick
          rekindled his romantic relationship with single mother and bar owner
          Penelope &quot;Penny&quot; Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly). Maverick
          was forced to overcome his residual guilt regarding Goose's death many
          years earlier, and the antagonism of the Admiral, and to succeed in
          completing the dangerous mission without casualties. The cinematography
          and thrilling action scenes of the fighter jet flight sequences were
          phenomenal and completely realistic.</font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>The Whale (2022)</b>, 117 minutes, D: Darren Aronofsky<br />
        Director Darren Aronofsky's very moving, daring, challenging and emotional
            drama was scripted by Samuel Hunter, who also wrote the 2012 stage
            play. Actor Brendan Fraser wore a fat-suit to appear  
            morbidly-obese at 600+ pounds, and was rewarded with an Oscar for
            Best Actor (the film also won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling).
            Matthew Libatique's cinematography was shot with a classic 1:33
            aspect ratio to emphasize the claustrophobic nature of  the protagonist's
             life. The dark, depressing and engaging film opened in early
            2016 in the squalid and oppressive 2nd-floor apartment of college
            writing teacher Charlie (Fraser) in a rural part of Moscow, Idaho.
            His sole occupation was teaching writing skills to students online
            (without his web-camera turned on, to hide his appearance as the
            Instructor - except for a black square). Various scenes in a week
            of Charlie's pained and trapped existence depicted his isolated,
            pitiable life in dim lighting, including his continual wheezing,
            groaning and coughing, struggling to get up to use his walker, bing-eating
            including gobbling down a complete bucket of greasy fried chicken
            and choking on a hefty meatball sub sandwich (requiring the Heimlich
            maneuver to save him), masturbating while watching gay pornography
            on his TV, and eating candy bars stashed in a kitchen drawer. The
            reclusive, near-death and self-destructive Charlie's single fascination
            was reading his favorite, insightful student essay (Spoiler: it was
            written by his own daughter in the 8th grade) on Herman Melville's <i>Moby
            Dick</i>, and Captain Ahab's vengeful search to kill the white whale
            - providing a clue to the meaning of the film's title. Dan
            (Sathya Sridharan) - the daily delivery-guy for Gambino's pizza,
            performed a familiar routine that never brought him face-to-face
            with Charlie - except toward the film's end when he saw Charlie at
            the door and ran off in horror. Three other visitors made regular
        appearances in Charlie's apartment: (1) his enabling, no-nonsense,
        responsible caregiver-nurse Liz (Oscar-nominated Hong Chau), who was
            at her wit's end when Charlie's blood pressure reached 238 over 134,
            and he was clearly dying of congestive heart failure, although he
            still refused to go to the hospital, (2) Thomas (Ty Simpkins) - a
            persistent, misguided but earnest New Life church missionary originally
            from Waterloo, IA who kept trying to proselytize and save Charlie
            - who didn't want to be saved, and (3) Charlie's estranged, troubled,
            hostile and rebellious high-school aged daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink)
            - a smart, angry teen who blamed Charlie for abandoning her and her
            mother 8 years earlier, to leave them and have a relationship with
            Alan Grant - a gay student (who ultimately committed suicide due
            to religious guilt and excommunication from the church). Charlie's
            binge-eating followed Alan's death as a way to deal with his grief.
            [Note: Alan was Liz's brother and had been raised in the strict,
            Jehovah's Witness-like New Life church, also similar to Fundamentalist
            Mormons. Liz was the adopted daughter of New Life's head pastor.]
            Charlie also received a rare visit from his estranged, alcoholic
            ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton), who was miffed that Charlie was saving
            $120,000 to pass on to Ellie instead of treating his own health.
            As the film concluded, the sad-eyed, broken, and regretful Charlie
            was hoping to reconnect, to encourage honesty in others, to make
            things right, and to express his true caring before his final
            breath. He was redeemed and liberated in the film's final moments
            when he stood up and was engulfed with a bright white light (accompanied
      by a memory of a trip to the beach with a younger Ellie (Jacey Sink)). </font></p>      </td>

        <p><b><font size="2">The Woman King (2022)</font></b><font size="2">,
            135 minutes, D: Gina Prince-Bythewood</font><br />
            <font size="2">This  action-filled historical epic and drama was
            inspired by true events that occurred in the actual West African
            Kingdom of Dahomey (on the Atlantic Ocean's coast, in the present
            day country of Benin) - one of the wealthiest, politically and militarily-strong
            states of Africa in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Threats
            of European global encroachment and exploitation of Africa emerged,
            at a time when the Dahomey Kingdom's new ruler King Ghezo (John
            Boyega) faced a decision in the 1820s - should he stand up and defend
            the freedom of their people from oppression and the continuation
            of the Portuguese slave trade from the Oyo Empire, or continue to
            accept slave-trading tributes (as his brother had done before him)?
            Ghezo was tasked with choosing a female co-leader - his primary preference
             was for fierce warrior leader General Nanisca (Viola Davis), the
            leader of the all-female warrior force of Agojie. In the meantime,
            Nanisca was forced with independently defending her kingdom's nation
            against forced slavery by gathering her warriors together. She was
            aided by Izogie (Lashana Lynch), Amenza (Sheila Atim), and new Agojie
            recruit Nawi (Thuso Mbedu), who revealed to Nanisca that she was
            adopted and had a birthmark on her left shoulder. [It was later revealed
            that in her youth, Nanisca had been captured by a young Oba Ade (Joel
            Mukadi as youth), raped, and impregnated - the resultant child was
            Nawi, her biological daughter.] In the film's stirring conclusion,
            Nanisca was about to be bestowed with the title Woman King by Ghezo,
            making her an equal ruling partner. However, she was first adamant
            about conducting a rescue mission for captive Agojie. During the
            fighting, Nawi escaped and Nanisca killed now General Oba Ade (Jimmy
            Odukoya as adult). Upon their victorious return to Dahomey, Ghezo crowned Nanisca  the
            Woman King.</font></p>      </td>

      <p><font size="2"><b>Women Talking (2022)</b>, 104 minutes, D: Sarah Polley<br />
        Director Sarah Polley's religious drama was based upon  Canadian Miriam
        Toews' 2018 novel, that provided an account of serial rapes conducted
        from 2005 to 2009  against women in a conservative, Bolivian
        Mennonite religious community. Nine men in the patriarchal Manitoba Colony's
            sect drugged their female victims (from age 3 to 60) with livestock
            tranquilizers and then accused the victimized women (some of whom
            became pregnant) of having exaggerated female imaginations, or that
            they were suffering God's punishment for their sins. The film with
            an ensemble cast was made in color, although the colors were super-saturated
            to make it appear with tones of grayish black and white. The &quot;based
        on a true story&quot; drama followed a group of women within the secluded
        colony of religious believers who were practicing their strict faith
        in the year 2010. The community of women was challenged by a series of
        domestic and sexual abuse and assault incidents committed by the colony's
        males against them. A core group of women in the isolated area who met
        for discussion in a hayloft, some of whom were both angry and self-loathing,
        decided that rather than submitting and doing nothing, they must confront
        the crisis and the male individuals who were responsible. The two most
        vindictive, self-determined, and vengeful women amongst them were Salome
        (Claire Foy) and Mariche (Jessie Buckley), joined by Ona (Rooney Mara),
        Agata (Judith Ivey), and Greta (Sheila McCarthy). They were fully aware
        that they would face serious consequences, such as ex-communication,
        for taking a strong stand against sexual violence. </font></p>      </td>
