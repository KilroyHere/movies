              minutes, D: George Lucas<br />
            In pre-Kennedy assassination America and in the pre-Vietnam War era,
            a time of innocence, this nostalgic, coming-of-age story featured
            the songs of its era, in a classic sound-track provided by Wolfman
            Jack's Rock 'n' Roll radio show. Director George Lucas memorialized
            his own teenage years in Modesto, California in this episodic, idealized,
            low-budget tale of a bygone era with numerous complex subplots during
            a series of misadventures. It was followed by the inevitable sequel:
            <i>More American Graffiti (1979)</i>, and the TV show <i>Happy Days</i> (1974-1984)
            was a successful spin-off (as was <i>Laverne &amp; Shirley</i> (1976-1983)). On their
            final summer night after their Class of 1962 graduation, two clean-cut,
            college-bound California high schoolers were introduced -- studious
              Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) (who had reservations about his
              future and leaving town) and popular senior-class president Steve
              Bolander (Ron Howard) - with girlfriend, upcoming senior, and head
            cheerleader Laurie Henderson (Cindy Williams) (Curt's sister). They
            and others cruised the streets of their N. California town in their
            hot rods, and hung out at Mel's Diner (featuring waitresses on roller
            skates). Other characters included 22 year-old, local drag-race champion and auto
            mechanic John Milner (Paul Le Mat) and out-of-town hot-rodder Bob
            Falfa (Harrison Ford) driving a black 1955 Chevy, gawky and nerdy
            Terry &quot;the Toad&quot; Fields (Charles Martin Smith), bratty 13 year-old
            Carol (Mackenzie Phillips), a mysterious and elusive blonde girl
            in a white 1956 T-Bird (Suzanne Somers), and an experienced pretty
            blonde Debbie (Candy Clark). John was compelled to protectively baby-sit
            and watch over Carol who rode in his yellow deuce coupe, while Curt
            became mesmerized by a glimpse of an unidentified sexy female in
            the white Thunderbird who mouthed the words to him: &quot;I love you&quot;
            - and he became obsessed with locating her all night long. Terry
            had borrowed Steve's 1958 Chevy Impala for the evening, and became
            acquainted with puffy-haired Debbie, but the car was stolen (while
            they were necking on a blanket) and he sought rescue by John from
            threatening thieves. In the pre-dawn hours, a drag-race was conducted
            between John and Falfa (with Laurie riding with him) on isolated
            Paradise Road - the race ended with John's victory after Falfa's
            car flipped, although miraculously no one was seriously injured.
            The film concluded with Laurie reuniting with Steve, and DJ Wolfman
            reading Curt's dedication-message on the radio to the blonde - who
            responded that she would be cruising 3rd Street that evening. However,
            by this time, Curt had become decisive about his future - he would
            definitely be leaving town by plane for college in just a few hours.
            On the other hand, Steve decided to postpone his departure to stay
            with Laurie, but saw Curt off at the airport in the morning. The
            postscript of the film briefly described the futures of four characters: John
            was killed by a drunk driver, Terry was MIA in Vietnam, Steve was employed
            as a Modesto, CA insurance agent, and Curt was in Canada as a writer.</font></p>

              29 year-old director/writer Terrence Malick's daring debut film

              couple, 19 year-old Charles Starkweather and 14 year-old Caril

              disturbing, complex character study, a coming-of-age crime drama,
              observed the twisted, strange actions of two young fugitives on
              a senseless, emotionally-apathetic, and casual homicidal spree
              from her small South Dakota hometown, and how they ensured their
              immortality through unplanned or unintentional murders before being
              apprehended. The film opened with the deadpan-toned,
              off-screen narration of one of the two main characters - a young,
              transplanted, motherless South Dakotan living in the small town
              of Fort Dupree: naive, lackadaisical, starry-eyed, celebrity magazine-addicted
              and impressionable 15 year old teenager Holly Sargis (Sissy Spacek),
              who was baton-twirling in the street. The girl concluded her first
              statement with: &quot;Little did I realize that what began in the alleys
              and backways of this quiet town would end in the Badlands of Montana.&quot;
              Holly was introduced to the unstable, social outcast, and misfit
              garbage collector who soon became her boyfriend - a charismatic,
              25 year-old Kit Carruthers (Martin Sheen, a James Dean look-alike),
              a troubled Korean War vet. Holly's widowed, house-painter-employed
              father Mr. Sargis (Warren Oates) disapproved of his daughter's
              growing romance with Kit, by coldly executing her beloved pet dog
              in a field, and ordered Kit to never see Holly again. In retaliation,
              Kit broke into Holly's house and pressured Holly to run away with
              him; when her over-protective and abusive father protested and
              threatened to call the police, Kit non-chalantly shot him dead
              - as Holly impassively observed. Holly seemed ready to become Kit's
              good-girl-gone-bad partner, when he torched Holly's house (and
              attempted to fake their fiery suicide with a recorded suicide-note
              left behind). The two then fled from town after detouring to Holly's
            high school to pick up her books. At first, the couple hid-out and
            'played house' at a treehouse that they constructed by a river bank
              - equipped with various traps and warning systems to alert them
              to trespassers, and survived by fishing and stealing chickens.
              Their idyllic time in their temporary home ended when three bounty hunters
              discovered their hideout and Kit ambushed and killed them. Kit
              and Holly drove to the isolated, solitary farmhouse of Kit's former
              garbage collector co-worker Cato (Ramon Bieri), but their stay
               ended badly when Kit killed him and also executed some of
              his visiting friends who were led to a storm celler and brutally
              shot. They were now forced to leave a second (or third) major crime-murder
              scene of their own making. The two become notorious fugitives in
              the Midwest, as their romanticized, celebrity folk hero status
              was being propagated by the popular media. They broke into a
            four-story Victorian mansion where they held the rich owner (John
            Carter) and his deaf maid (Dona Baldwin) hostage for awhile, before
            stealing clothes, supplies, and the man's  black Cadillac  
            to continue their cross-country flight toward the Badlands and wild
            frontier area of Montana - and later into Saskatchewan, Canada. During
              the last leg of their journey, one night, they danced in their
              Cadillac's headlights (to the tune of Nat King Cole singing <i>A
            Blossom Fell</i> on the radio). Ultimately, their crime spreed ended
            when they were spotted by a police helicopter and Holly (who was
            tired of running) refused to join him and promptly surrendered; Kit
                led state troopers and a Sheriff on a wild chase before the attention-seeking
                Kit calmly gave up - he marked the spot where he was apprehended
                with a rock cairn; both Holly and Kit were detained and handcuffed,
                and shortly later at an airport hangar, Kit offered souvenirs
                (some of his personal possessions, such as his comb) to idolizing
            deputies. In the final voice-over as the film concluded,
              Holly informed everyone that Kit was executed in the electric
              chair and his body was donated to science, and that she was only
              considered as an accessory to her partner's crimes (even though
              she stood by impassively and cooperatively). She pursued her
              marital dreams by marrying her lawyer's son, and also told how
              Kit's charming nature could entrance murderers in prison and
          law officers.</font></p>          </td>

            Based on a short story by Daphne De Maurier - this supernatural, mysterious,
            eerie, psychological thriller told about a British couple in Venice. Following
            the tragic, accidental drowning of their daughter, John and Laura
            Baxter (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) traveled to Venice where
            he worked on restoring a church, still shattered and haunted by their
            child's death. The film was highlighted by their extended love-making
            scene while both were dressing for dinner. In the off-season resort,
            they met two elderly sisters, Wendy and Heather (Hilary Mason and
            Clelia Matania), one of whom was blind but claimed to be psychic. She
            insisted that, in visions, she saw the spirit of the Baxters' red-coated
            daughter, and possessed a message of warning from the dead child.
            While John was skeptical and resistant, he caught a flashing, random
            glimpse of a red-raincoated 'child' darting around a dark street
            corner alley - and he saw Laura and the sisters on a funeral gondola
            drifting down a Venetian canal. The film concluded with John racing
            in pursuit after the red-garbed figure through Venetian alleys, only
        to be slashed across the throat by the androgynous dwarf figure. He fell
            onto the stone floor and bled to death - punctuated by the peals
            of bells, swirling camera angles, and quick images from earlier in
            the film. John's funeral at a Venetian canal-side church ended the
            film.</font></p></td>

            The big-budget, American/Hong Kong co-production (and the first American-produced
            martial arts film) was shot on location in Asia. It featured  
            an aggressive score by <em>Mission Impossible's</em> (TV) composer
            Lalo Schifrin. It  took a   satirical
            jab at the James Bond thriller films with Lee playing a Bond-type
            character who didn't need gadgetry. This
            legendary film has been often considered as the best &quot;chopsocky&quot; or &quot;kickfest&quot; (kung
            fu and martial arts) film ever made by an American studio (Warner
            Bros). It starred influential action cult hero Bruce Lee in his final,
            signature film role before his untimely death at the age of 32. Partly
            inspired by the Lee-helmed film <em>Way of the Dragon (1972)</em> (aka <em>Return
            of the Dragon</em>), the film pitted  renegade, villainous Shaolin
            Temple monk  Han (Shih Kien) against  Jeet Kune Do master  
            Lee (Bruce Lee), who was recruited by the British to infiltrate Han's
            drug and prostitution operation under the guise of taking part in
            his annual, invitational competition on a mysterious island fortress
            near Hong Kong. The martial-arts tournament between champions was
            sponsored by the crime boss - a one-handed, blood-thirsty mastermind
            who at one point supplemented his missing hand with a fearsome metal
            claw. The film was only semi-serious, featuring not only a subplot
            about an indebted, American playboy-adventurer named Roper (John
            Saxon), one of the competitors, but an added blaxploitation character
            named Williams (Jim Kelly, a real-life ex-football star, and African-American
            karate champion who would later star in a black martial arts film
            titled <em>Black Samurai (1977)).</em>  The most memorable scene
            was the climactic showdown between Lee and Han in a hall of mirrors
            (with homage to Welles' <a href="ladyf.html"><em>The
            Lady From Shanghai (1948)</em></a>), as well as the first fight in
            the competition between Lee and O'Hara (Robert Wall), Han's top man
            responsible for the death of Lee's sister  Su Lin (Angela Mao - the &quot;female
            Bruce Lee&quot;). There was also an uncredited cameo by Chuck Norris
            as a Messenger (who had a memorable fight scene with Lee in <em>Way
            of the Dragon (1972)</em>), as well as the first, brief screen appearance
            by Lee's martial arts &quot;successor&quot; and cinema legend, Jackie
        Chan. </font></p></td>

           Director Friedkin's disturbing, shocking, exploitative, and frightening film adaptation
            of William Peter Blatty's best-selling, blockbuster book was about satanic
            demon possession. A sweet pre-teenaged girl Regan (Linda Blair) became
            possessed by an evil spirit - and wa soon transformed and disfigured
            into a head-rotating, levitating, green vomit-spewing, obscenity-shouting
            creature. Her divorced mother Mrs. MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) was at
            wit's end, until she called on a dedicated, faith-questioning Jesuit
            priest Father Karras (Jason Miller) to exorcise the malevolent devil
            from her daughter's body. An elderly priest Father Merrin (Max von
            Sydow), whose archaeology project released the Satanic being, also
            risked his life to administer rites of exorcism with incantations

                D: Clint Eastwood<br />
               In this stylistic, controversial, off-beat
              and bizarre revisionist western, director/star Eastwood (with his
              second directorial effort, and his first western) portrayed the
              enigmatic, anti-hero loner, named only as The Stranger (similar
              to Sergio Leone's &quot;Man with No Name&quot;). He took a stylized
              approach to Sergio Leone's 1960s &quot;spaghetti&quot; westerns
              and Fred Zinnemann's <i>High Noon (1952)</i>. The bleak and violent
              morality tale began with the 'high plains drifter' slaughtering
              three hired guns after arriving in the corrupt mining community
              of Lago. He was then revered as a protective and righteous savior
              of the townsfolk, and hired by the mining company to hold off three
              more desperadoes on their way to town: outlaw Stacey Bridges (Geoffrey
              Lewis) and brothers Dan (Dan Vardis) and Cole Carlin (Anthony James).
              The trio had brutally whipped and killed the town's local lawman
              Marshal Jim Duncan (Buddy Van Horn) who was buried with an unmarked
              gravestone. Dwarf Mordecai (Billy Curtis) (appointed by the Stranger
              as the town's mayor and sheriff) and innkeeper's wife Sarah Belding
              (Verna Bloom), the Stranger's perverse love interest, suspected
              that the Stranger had unusual intentions. He made increasingly-bizarre
              and outlandish demands, painted the town red, and renamed it &quot;Hell.&quot; By
              his cryptic presence, the almost-supernatural Stranger revealed
              the townspeople's secret cowardice and hypocrisy. The
              film ambiguously asked: was he the symbolic reincarnation of the
              town's murdered honest young lawman Jim Duncan, or his brother
              seeking retribution? In the concluding sequence, he contemptuously
              killed three vengeful desperadoes and then abruptly and mysteriously
              left. As he rode away from the ruined town as Mordecai asked: &quot;I
              never did know your name.&quot; The Stranger replied: &quot;Yes,
          you do. Take care.&quot;</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Long Goodbye (1973), </b>112 minutes, D: Robert
              Altman<br />
              Director Robert Altman's deconstructed, post-noir mystery crime-thriller/drama
               was criticized for taking liberties and degrading the familiar
              Raymond Chandler character (in the 1953 published novel), for updating
              the novel's late 1940s time-frame to the 70s, and for drastically
              changing the ending. He deflected outraged audiences by claiming
              plot wasn't as important as character analysis. Altman's quirky
              film included a first-person, constantly-moving camera (especially
              in the early scene introducing cat-loving Marlowe), and several
              versions of the movie's theme song - a John Williams/Johnny Mercer
              ballad (first sung under the credits). Among the film's off-beat
              cast was the main character - a chain-smoking bachelor and quintessential
              private eye-detective Philip Marlowe (Elliott Gould), deceptively
              portrayed as hip, laid-back, slovenly, and casually-cool, who lived
              in a shabby LA apartment with female hippie neighbors nearby on
              a balcony in the nude practicing yoga. The solitary, idiosyncratic
              and lonely Marlowe literally rambled throughout the film, joking
              with other characters and with himself (via a running monologue).
              In the plot, Marlowe's playboy friend Terry Lennox (ex-NY Yankee
              player Jim Bouton) was accused of severely beating and killing his rich wife
              Sylvia - but the suspect mysteriously disappeared after Marlowe
              was convinced to drop him off at the Mexican border at Tijuana.
              The uncooperative Marlowe was put in jail for a brief time as an
              accessory, but then after his release conducted his own investigation,
              even though he was told that the case was closed following Terry's
              apparent 'suicide' three days later in Mexico (he was found dead
              in a Mexican hotel according to officials). Mysterious, callous
              and manipulative blonde Eileen Wade (Nina Van Pallandt in her US film debut) hired
              him to find her frustrated, self-destructive alcoholic novelist
              husband Roger Wade (Sterling Hayden), who had gone missing for
              a week - and ironically lived in the same Malibu Colony neighborhood
              where Terry lived. Marlowe located Roger at Dr. Verringer's (Henry
              Gibson) private, self-help detox clinic,  and forcibly took
              Roger home to Eileen. Marlowe also learned
              that Terry owed $350,000 dollars to mobster and loan shark Marty
              Augustine (Mark Rydell), when he was violently confronted by the
              demanding, bottle-wielding Augustine with a group of hoods, who
              maimed his own mistress Jo Ann Eggenweiler (Jo Ann Brody) with
              a broken Coke bottle while threatening Marlowe. The case became
              extremely complex and interconnected when Marlowe realized that
              mobster Marty knew the Wades, and that Terry's unlikely 'death'
              was somehow related. At a beach party at the Wade's home, Marlowe
              overheard the sinister and shady quack-psychiatrist Verringer demanding
              and forcing Roger to sign a $4,000 check to pay his bill. Shortly
              later in the dark, Roger suicidally walked into the ocean and drowned
              himself. Piecing clues together, Marlowe realized that Roger had
              been involved in an affair with Terry's wife Sylvia (and Roger
              had disclosed Terry's affair with Eileen to Sylvia), but Roger
              had checked into the asylum before Sylvia's murder - so he couldn't
              have murdered her. Terry was undoubtedly alive when Marlowe received
              a $5,000 bill (a &quot;portrait of Madison&quot;) mailed to him accompanied
              by a letter of apology. After a bag arrived at Marty's place with
              the missing $350,000, Marlowe was suspicious that Eileen had returned
              the money and was planning on selling the Wade house. On a hunch,
              Marlowe traveled to Mexico and located Terry in a villa on the
              town's outskirts after bribing officials to tell the truth. Terry
              admitted to the convoluted love affairs - and that his own romance
              with Eileen had angered his wife Sylvia, who threatened to go to
              the police during a fierce argument and report Terry's nefarious
              associations with gangster Marty. Terry then confessed to brutally
              beating Sylvia to the point of death to silence her, before giving
              Marty's money to Eileen and fleeing to Mexico. Exasperated for
              being used and betrayed, Marlowe shot Terry dead. Walking down
              the road back to town, Eileen passed him in a jeep on her way to
              seeing her lover Terry. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Martin Scorsese<br />
            Martin Scorsese's intense drama - his third full-length and first
            successful film (after <i>Who's Knocking at My Door? (1970)</i> and <i>Boxcar Bertha (1972)</i>),
             was semi-autobiographical. The low-budget, brutally-realistic
            tale that included energizing early 60s rock 'n' roll, told about
            four struggling, second-generation small-time Italian-American hoods
            on the &quot;mean streets&quot; of New York's ghetto-like Little
            Italy trying to establish themselves (the area was populated
            with petty lawbreakers, gangsters, and rampant crime). [The first
            words of the film were a key, voice-over narration by Scorsese under
            a black screen: &quot;You don't make up for your sins in a church.
            You do it in the streets, you do it at home. The rest is bulls--t
            and you know it.&quot;] The main character was ambitious, wannabe Mafia apprentice and strong
            Italian Catholic Charlie Cappa (Harvey Keitel) - a symbolic representative
            of director Scorsese himself.  Charlie's uncle
            Giovanni (Cesare Danova) was the local Mafia boss and grooming his
            nephew for 'respectable' gang life. Unclear and confused about his
            life's direction and loyalties, Charlie wrestled with his devout
            Catholic guilt (continually seeking redemption and suffering penance),
            realizing the temptations of the Mafia and its constrictions. He
            also struggled with maintaining a secret romantic relationship with
            his epileptic cousin Teresa (Amy Robinson), who was regarded by Giovanni
            as somehow bad. One of Charlie's ambitions was to manage a neighborhood
            bar-restaurant owned by Tony (David Proval). The neighborhood's violent,
            wild, unpredictable and hot-headed Johnny Boy (Robert De Niro) was
            the simple-minded brother of Teresa. In the opening sequence, Johnny
            Boy exhibited his irresponsibility and recklessness by blowing up
            a mailbox, and then later became dangerously obligated and indebted
            to the threatening local loan shark, Michael (Richard Romanus). Charlie
            found himself aiding and coming-to-the-rescue of Johnny Boy multiple
            times. Toward the film's ending, a bloody denouement, as Charlie
            drove Johnny Boy and Teresa in a borrowed getaway car out of Little
            Italy to Brooklyn, they were ambushed in a drive-by shooting by another
            car (carrying a vengeful Michael and shooter-assassin Jimmy Shorts
            (Martin Scorsese)). After six shots, the car crashed into a hydrant,
            causing injuries to both Charlie (who had been hit twice) and front-seat
            passenger Teresa, who required hospitalization. Johnny Boy was presumably
            lethally wounded when shot in the neck, and staggered around on the
            street before collapsing.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Paper Moon (1973), </b>102 minutes, D: Peter Bogdanovich<br />
            Director Peter Bogdanovich's amusing road-drama was an engaging off-beat
            comedy about a wily, Depression Era con-man who sold Bibles to mourning
            widows. He was accompanied by his scheming and tough 'adopted' daughter
            (pairing real-life father-actor Ryan O'Neal and his nine-year old
            daughter Tatum O'Neal - who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar
            for her substantial film debut role).  In Gorham, Kansas in the
              mid-1930s at a gravesite for the funeral of Essie Mae Loggins,
              the deceased mother's young and precocious, orphaned 9 year-old
            Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neal) coincidentally met young, fly-by-night
            Bible-selling con-man Moses &quot;Moze&quot; Pray (Ryan O'Neal) -
            a family acquaintance (he was an old girlfriend of Essie Mae's, and
            suspected as Addie's 'father'). He was convinced to take Addie to
            her only known relatives in St. Joseph, MO. Addie
              convinced Moze to let her accompany him on the road, while she
            continually argued that the $200 given to him as compensation for
            the DUI car accident that killed her mother be given to her. Moses'
            unethical swindling 'business' was to represent the Kansas Bible
            Company and sell personally-monogrammed Bibles to recent widows,
            while claiming that the deceased husband had ordered the Bible. Addie
            revealed that she was as shrewd, manipulative and cunning as Moses.
            While selling Bibles, she posed as Moses' daughter, and cleverly
            suggested increasing (or decreasing) the Bible price in certain circumstances.
            At a carnival in the Harem Slave show tent, Moses became romantically
            entranced by gold-digging, good-time girl and busty exotic dancer
            Miss Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn), actually a prostitute. Addie
            took an immediate jealousy-fueled dislike for Trixie, and devised
            ways to sabotage Moses' interest in her so that she wouldn't ruin
            their team-partnership. Later, after Addie had  
            discovered that Moze had spent the money owed to her for a brand-new
            Model 68 convertible to impress Miss Trixie, she ingeniously
            devised, conspired and orchestrated a scheme to separate Trixie from
            Moses by having her bed Floyd (Burton Gilliam), their front-desk
            clerk at the Exchange Hotel, and getting Moses to walk in on them
            having sex - the ploy actually worked. As the film was concluding
            after misadventures with bootleggers and a Sheriff, young Addie was
            dropped off at her relative Aunt Billie's (Rose-Mary Rumbley) place
            in St. Joseph, MO. As Moze removed her luggage, Addie left him an
            envelope in his car with a picture of herself - it had been taken
            at the carnival of her sitting on a 'paper moon' (a crescent moon
            swing) - her objective was to be reunited again with him on the road. Addie
            ran away from her Aunt's place so that she could continue swindling
            and grifting with Moses on the road, and caught up with him sitting
            in his stalled truck only a short way down the road (he had paused
            there and had second thoughts after he had found her envelope on
            the front seat with her 'paper moon' picture). </font></p></td>

          fellow prisoner was withdrawn and shy counterfeiter-forger 
          Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman), with Coke bottle-thick glasses. They bonded
          in friendship when Papillon became Dega's bodyguard. Both ended up
          in the notorious French penal colony in French Guiana, in a brutal
          work camp. After an escape attempt when he was punished with solitary
          confinement and reduced rations, Papillon under duress, refused to
          snitch on Dega for providing him with coconuts. Obsessed with flight
          and escape, Papillon continued to plot multiple escape attempts but
          was always recaptured and caged. In the final scene when Dega was reunited
          with Papillon on Devil's Island, Papillon realized that Dega had become
          mentally-ill and broken, accustomed to the solitary life on the windswept
          lonely island, and was unable to join him for his final successful

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973)</strong>,
              106 minutes, D: Sam Peckinpah<br />
              Noted as director Peckinpah's final western, and as a complex and
              challenging film that was initially cut and re-edited by MGM studios
              against the director's wishes. Many years later, Peckinpah released
              his own version of the revisionist western. Although it featured
              lots of legendary western character actors, it replaced traditional
              western content (i.e., a dramatic gun-battle showdown between good
              and bad guys) with more character study, ambivalence and guilt
          over betrayal. Set in New Mexico in 1881, the
          tale was about the continuing confrontation between outlaw-turned-lawman
          Sheriff Pat Garrett (James Coburn), and his notorious old friend, anti-hero
              outlaw Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson) (aka William Bonney).
              Both were aging and viewing the handwriting on the wall - reluctantly
              facing the slow death of the &quot;Old West&quot; by desecrating
              future forces of corrupting, cold-hearted capitalism. The two were
              joined by enigmatic stranger Alias (folk singer Bob Dylan in his
              first screen role, and singing the memorable &quot;Knockin' on
          Heaven's Door&quot;). Garrett was named sheriff of Lincoln County to
          defeat his old friend Billy the Kid. Although Billy was successfully
          jailed and awaiting execution, he escaped by shooting two deputy sheriffs.
              Then, in Santa Fe, Garrett was hired by the Santa Fe Ring, a group
              of wealthy (and corrupt) New Mexico cattle-land barons, politicians,
              attorneys and greedy speculators, including the governor (Jason
              Robards Jr.) and cattle baron Chisum (Barry Sullivan). He was commissioned
          to bring in Billy and end his killing sprees and cattle rustling. Billy
          ignored Garrett's wise advice about escaping to Mexico, and met his
          fateful end at the hands of his friend. Garrett stalked Billy (back
          at Fort Sumner rather than fleeing to Mexico) while he was making love
          to Maria (real-life wife Rita Coolidge) and killed him point-blank.
          The film ended 28 years later in 1909 near Las Cruces, New Mexico,
          when Garrett was ambushed and ironically assassinated by the same group,
          the Santa Fe Ring, who had earlier hired him to kill Billy - a Faustian
          conclusion.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Woody Allen<br />
            One of Woody Allen's funniest and zaniest films - it was a futuristic
            science fiction comedy classic and screwball comedy - with Dixieland
            and swing music (from the Preservation Hall Jazz Band of New Orleans).
            This 'fish-out-of-water' comedy was from Allen's earlier period,
            when he was known for appearing in or directing lightweight comedies,
            such as <em>Take the Money and Run (1969)</em>, <em>Bananas (1971)</em>, <em>Play
            It Again, Sam (1972)</em>, and <em>Everything You Always Wanted
            to Know About Sex* But Were Afraid to Ask (1972)</em>. Filled with
            one-liners, Allen's film both satirized the 1970's and parodied sci-fi
            books and past classics, such as<em> Buck Rogers &quot;Serial&quot; (1939), 
			</em>Carroll's <em>Alice in Wonderland, </em>Kubrick's <em>2001: A Space
            Odyssey (1968)</em> and <em>A Clockwork Orange
            (1971)</em>, George Lucas' <em>THX 1138 (1971)</em>, George Orwell's
            futuristic novel <em>1984</em>, and Aldous Huxley's <em>Brave New
            World</em>. It also evoked  slapstick comedy classics, such as
            Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton films, the Keystone Kops, Chaplin's <em>Modern
            Times (1936)</em> and the Marx Brothers' <em>Duck
            Soup (1933)</em>. One sly cameo was that of Douglas Rain as an evil computer near the end
              of the film, gently spoofing his role as HAL from <em>2001: A Space
              Odyssey (1968)</em>, and Mike Myers' <em>Austin Powers</em> series
              also owed a debt to this film. It was praised for its more
              even and disciplined storyline than his previous films. Director/writer
              Woody Allen played the main character -- jazz clarinet musician
              and co-owner of a Greenwich Village health food store (Happy Carrot),
              the nerdy and nebbish Miles Monroe. He found himself 200 years
              in the future in the dystopian year 2173. The Rip Van Winkle character
              learned that he had been cryogenically 'frozen' in aluminum foil
              when complications arose - after he had entered a New York hospital
              in 1973 for what he thought was a minor peptic ulcer operation.
              (He was later asked: &quot;It's hard to believe that you haven't had sex 
			  for two hundred years.&quot; &quot;Two
            hundred and four,&quot; he replied, &quot;if you count my marriage.&quot;)
            He soon discovered that he was considered both a subversive alien
            fugitive by a Big Brother-type totalitarian government and a savior
            to the revolutionary underground rebels wishing to overthrow the
            police state. Worried that he was about to be brainwashed, he escaped
            and ineptly disguised himself as a robot - a white-faced, bespectacled
            domestic butler in the home of his future love interest - a
            rich, clueless, Rod McKuen-loving, pseudo-intellectual poetess named
            Luna Schlosser (Diane Keaton in her second appearance with Allen
            in a film, but in her first Allen-directed film). In one funny scene
            during a hosted party, he passed around a silver-metallic round,
            orgasm-inducing &quot;Orb.&quot; Fearing
            detainment, Miles went through a series of comic misadventures -
            he accidentally hid in a mechanized Orgasmatron, came upon a garden
            with giant vegetables, slipped on a gigantic banana peel during a
            madcap chase, won a mock beauty pageant believing he was Miss America,
            and was fitted for a suit by two robotic yet very Jewish tailors.
            Ultimately, Miles was captured and reprogrammed, but was saved by
            the now-converted revolutionary Luna and then deprogrammed. In the
            climax, the two joined together to overthrow the government by attempting
            to disguise themselves as doctors to disrupt an operation that might
            save the life of the Leader (a wheel-chair bound dictator with a
            white dog). After a bombing, the Leader was reduced
            to a benign, disembodied nose - and then steam-rolled. </font></p>          </td>

          <font size="2">This blockbuster Best Picture winner was an entertaining,
          stylish, playful, charming, over-produced crime-caper that revived
          interest in Scott Joplin's ragtime music. It reunited the successful
          'buddy' teams of director George Roy Hill with stars Redford and Newman
          from the comic western <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)</i> four
          years earlier. The comedy/drama had an entertaining, good-natured twisting
          plot about two small-time con artists (Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff/Mr.
          Shaw and Robert Redford as Johnny Hooker/Kelly) in 1930s Depression-and
          Prohibition-Era Chicago. The two joined together for revenge (using
          an off-track horse betting trick) against big-time New York racketeer
          mob boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) in the film's conclusion. Inter-titles
          highlighted the heist's clever steps (the &quot;Set-Up,&quot; the
		  &quot;Hook,&quot; the &quot;Tale,&quot; the &quot;Wire,&quot; the &quot;Shut-Out,&quot; and
          the &quot;Sting&quot;). </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Wicker Man (1973, UK),</b> 88 minutes, D:
              Robin Hardy<br />
              Director Robin Hardy's suspenseful, mysterious and erotic folk
          horror-occult film was an R-rated classic British supernatural thriller.
          In the plot set in late April of 1973, repressed, virginal, puritanical
          and devoutly religious Scottish policeman Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward
          Woodward) traveled solo by seaplane to Summerisle (during the opening
          title credits) - a remote Scottish (Hebridian) island. He was searching
           for a missing young 12 year-old schoolgirl named Rowan Morrison
          (Geraldine Cowper) from an anonymous tip in a letter. She was the alleged
          daughter of May Morrison (Irene Sunter), a resident of the island;
          it was suspected that the missing-girl (or kidnapped?) victim might
          be located there, or there might be clues to her disappearance. The
          island   of Summerisle was owned and run by  eccentric millionaire Lord Summerisle (Christopher
          Lee). The townsfolk inhabitants living there were openly-sexual
            pagan worshippers who followed the
            teachings of their atheistic leader Lord Summerisle. Sgt.
            Howie believed (although wrongly) that the school girl was to be
            a potential virginal human sacrifice (the May Queen) on May Day,
          as part of a pagan ceremony to insure a good fruit harvest. While there,
          Howie was continually tested by the town's pagan practices and open
          sexual behavior. The film included  the much-discussed scene of the
            innkeeper's sensual daughter Willow MacGregor (Britt Ekland) in the
            next room attempting to entice Howie on the second night of his visit
          to the town, while lodging in the Green Man Inn. In the chilling finale
          of the cult classic, Howie learned that <i>he</i> was the one to be
          sacrificed. He was brought there to the island to be their pagan sacrifice,
          to appease the gods and to bring a plentiful fruit harvest. The 'missing'
          girl was never really missing - but had served as bait to lure him
          there. She had been part of Lord Summerisle's grand plan to bring him
          to the island and entrap him as the year's virginal fire sacrifice,
          after a disastrous harvest. Howie was regarded as the perfect
          candidate: (&quot;Animals are fine, but their acceptability is limited.
          A young child is even better, but not <i>nearly</i> as effective as
          the right kind of adult&quot;). He was told he was the &quot;unique&quot; sacrificial
          subject: (&quot;You will undergo death and rebirth. Resurrection, if
          you like. The rebirth, sadly, will not be yours, but that of our crops&quot;);
          he retorted back: &quot;I am a Christian. And as a Christian, I hope
          for resurrection. And even if you kill me now, it is I who will live
          again, not your damned apples.&quot;  He was stripped and clothed in
          a ceremonial garment with his hands bound (&quot;It is time to keep
          your appointment with The Wicker Man&quot;). He was led to a giant,
          hollow wicker-constructed figure of a man on a cliffside at sunset
          where he cried out (&quot;Oh, my God!&quot;). The 'wicker man' statue
          was created of wicker materials designed to be used for fire sacrifices
          - with compartments for live farm animals (pigs, ducks, calves, etc.).
          He was horrified when he was locked inside the structure and the worshippers
          surrounded it (and sang a Middle English folk song with lyrics) as
          it was set on fire. As Howie was consumed by the flames, he recited
          the 23rd Psalm (&quot;The lord's my shepherd, I'll not want, He takes
          me down to lie in pastures...&quot;), and prayed for deliverance. </font></p></td>
