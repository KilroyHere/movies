              minutes, D: Woody Allen<br />
              Actor/director Woody Allen's  early
              anarchic slapstick comedy featured frequent lampooning political
              commentary, visual set-ups and sight-gags, and witty one-liner
              jokes. The opening scene was a play-by-play commentary
              by ABC's<i> Wide World of Sports</i> of a Latin-American president's &quot;live,
              on-the-spot assassination&quot; 
              on the outdoor palace steps in the tiny Third World Republic of
              San Marcos; sportscaster announcer Howard Cosell (Himself) provided
              the live coverage, as he asked the dying leader: &quot;Well, of
              course, you're upset, and that's understandable under the circumstances.
          l guess now you'll have to announce your retirement.&quot; The  clumsy,
          anxiety-ridden nerd Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) was employed by
          General Equipment as a guinea-pig for his New York company's strange
          inventions as a consumer product tester with a malfunctioning, sedentary
          exercise-machine (&quot;The Execu-cisor&quot;) designed to be used
          by busy office executives at their desks. One of the film's most hilarious
          scenes was set in an adult porno shop, where the aspiring playboy Fielding
          nervously purchased a porno magazine titled <i>Orgasm</i>. Fielding
          also unsuccessfully and cowardly attempted to protect an old woman
          during a subway mugging by two thugs (including a young Sylvester Stallone
          in his screen debut). His  red-headed radical, social activist, college
              student girlfriend Nancy (Louise Lasser) urged him to sign a petition
              supporting the rebels of San Marcos, who were opposed to the new
              appointed dictator Gen. Emilio M. Vargas (Carlos
          Montalban). After an unsatisfying attempt at sex with her (when
              she complained that he was completely immature): (Fielding: &quot;How
              am I immature?&quot; Nancy: &quot;Well...intellectually, emotionally
              and sexually.&quot; Fielding: &quot;Yeah, but in what other ways?&quot;),
          she decided to break up with him. In despair after the breakup, Fielding
              traveled to the tiny Latin American banana republic
              of San Marcos; he disguised himself as a
              fake-bearded revolutionary guerrilla 
          to pose as the guest of the new dictator. He was held in a rebel camp
               in the middle of the jungle and trained with them after escaping
              from Gen. Vargas' assassins. He placed a to-go order of almost
              one thousand grilled cheese sandwiches and seven hundred cups of
              coffee for troops at a lunch counter deli during a South American
              revolution, before he was installed as El Presidente of the republic
              of San Marcos, to replace the power-mad, self-appointed rebel leader
              Esposito (Jacobo Morales). Now as El Presidente  (and wearing
              a ridiculous fake red beard), Fielding was urged to return to the
              US to attend a high-society dinner fundraiser. He was
              also reunited with Nancy (who at first didn't recognize him) who
              was impressed by his leadership qualities. During the scene of
              his  US trial  after he was arrested for treason (in
              which FBI head J. Edgar Hoover (Dorothi Fox) appeared as a fat,
              middle-aged black woman), Fielding acted as his own defense lawyer
              - he cross-examined himself and objected to the Judge, who finally
              ruled that he would receive a 15-year suspended sentence (if he
              didn't live in the Judge's neighborhood). The closing televised
              Fielding Mellish Honeymoon Night broadcast (on Wide World of Sports)
              was viewed as a competitive, between-the-covers, sexual boxing
              match by commentator Howard Cosell. Fielding was reunited with
              Nancy as his recent marital partner and in bed with her at the
              Royal Manhattan Hotel for the competitive bout. Afterwards, Nancy
              admitted that it was over too quickly: &quot;The timing was a little
              off, but l think he'll be fine. I mean, he's not the worst l've
              had. Not the best, but not the worst.&quot; Their next bout would
              be in the late spring - and Cosell assured viewers he would be
              there to cover it.</font></p></td>

            Director Stanley Kubrick provocatively adapted Anthony Burgess' famous
            novel with this glossy, stylish, graphically-violent, controversial,
            futuristic, science-fiction satire. It was about the effects of crime
            and punishment (aversion therapy and brainwashing against violence)
            on a British teenaged punk named Alex (Malcolm McDowell). After
            a night of hooliganism with his vicious gang of droogs, including
            gang rapes and beatings, the sadistic was Alex was apprehended. In
            a grim, unorthodox governmental experiment, he was re-programmed,
            through his love for Beethoven's music, to reject violence, but he
            was dehumanized in the process of being cured. Vengeance was revisited
            upon him by his former victims after he was released into the society.</font></p></td>

              minutes, D: William Friedkin<br />
            William Friedkin's action-packed, intense, gritty, Best Picture-winning
            crime thriller was filmed on location and based on a true story about
            one of the largest narcotics seizures of all-time (in 1962 when 120
            pounds of pure heroin worth $32 million, were confiscated after
            being smuggled into the country hidden in a vehicle). The screenplay
            by Ernest Tidyman about a crackdown on a multi-million dollar international
            dope smuggling ring was based on Robin Moore's best-selling 1969
            book <i>The French Connection</i>. The crime classic starred 
            two hard-nosed, vulgar New York City police cops who exposed an international,
            heroin-smuggling operation based in Marseilles - headed by suave,
            elusive, mastermind crime boss Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey). The
            film opened with Charnier's hit-man/henchman Pierre Nicoli (Marcel
            Bozzufi) callously murdering a French detective in Marseilles. The
            action shifted to NYC, where passionate, tough, pushy, and unorthodox narcotics 
			detective Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle
            (Best-Actor winning Gene Hackman) recklessly and obsessively fought
            crime with his partner Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider). On a hunch after
            viewing the suspicious flashing of money in an Eastside club, the
            two plainclothes cops tailed the suspect, Salvatore &quot;Sal&quot; Boca (Tony
            LoBianco) to a candy store front, who later was found to be associated
            with Jewish mafia boss Joel Weinstock (Harold Gray) - a major financial
            backer of the illegal importation of drugs. Shoot-outs, chases, stalkings,
            and other tense scenes included  the breath-taking,
            famous elevated-railway scene of Doyle fearlessly borrowing a car
            and narrowly dodging traffic and bystanders below to give chase (in
            Bensonhurst)  after the  runaway train commandeered
            by Pierre Nicoli. The drugs were ultimately found cleverly hidden
            in the rocker panels of a Lincoln Continental Mark III owned by leading
            French TV personality Henri Devereaux (Frederic De Pasquale). A duplicate
            car was released, and Charnier drove it to an old factory on Wards
            Island to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs for the payoff. The
            story ended with a massive ambush and shoot-out, resulting in Boca's
            killing and Weinstock's arrest. When Doyle and Buddy pursued Charnier
            through a subterranean warehouse on Wards Island, federal agent Mulderig
            (Bill Hickman) was accidentally killed by Doyle. The elusive Charnier
            (who evidently slipped away and was never caught) was disturbing
            to Doyle: (&quot;The son of a bitch is here. I saw him. I'm gonna get him&quot;).  The
            film deliberately concluded on a mysterious note and with  a failed
            denouement. A sequel four years later, <i>French Connection II (1975)</i>, chased Charnier
            to Marseilles.</font></p>          </td>

            Director Peter Bogdanovich's bleak, black and
            white cinematic modern-day classic was based
            on the novel by Larry McMurtry. It was set in the
            small, northwestern (fictional) Texas town of Anarene in the period
            between the end of World War II and the Korean War in the early 50s.
            The  poignant, coming-of-age tale was about the loss of innocence
            for teenagers in the slowly-dying town, symbolized by the closing
            of the local picture palace, owned by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson).
            It told about a pair of HS football players, seniors Sonny
            Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) - who had an affair with the lonely football-basketball
            coach's wife Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman), and Duane Jackson (Jeff
            Bridges) - who dated the sexy, self-centered, spoiled student beauty
            Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut) and then enlisted
            after being dumped. Other desperate townsfolk were also having affairs
            - Jacy's loose mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn) with oilfield worker Abilene

              D: Robert Altman<br />
            Iconoclastic and offbeat director Robert Altman's classic, dark-toned,
            moody, and dramatic anti-Western  (including a love story) was 
            based on the novel <em>McCabe</em> by
            Edmund Naughton. The dimly-lit, lyrical and cynically-bleak
            tale  about a struggle for survival presented the American dream
            gone sour, in a revisionist western that concluded with a prolonged
            shootout. Gloomy folk music from Leonard Cohen organically and hauntingly
            complemented the pace of the film. It also featured great cinematography
            by Vilmos Zsigmond - beautifully envisioned (filmed on location in
            Canada), with Altman's cinematographer creating an antique-like,
            painterly portrait of the unsightly town at the turn of the century
            (1902), as industrialization was occurring. A mysterious, roguish,
            bearded small-time, frontier drifter and two-bit gambler John McCabe
            (Warren Beatty) opened up a brothel/casino in the great northern,
            wintry wilderness settlement of Presbyterian Church - a grimy, lamp-lit
            and shoddy mining town. He had used his winnings to build a classy
            saloon-casino-brothel in the remote, makeshift Washington community.
            But then the film portrayed his ultimately, naive, and unsuccessful
            efforts to build a capitalistic business. Amiable, not-very-bright
            braggart McCabe, with entrepreneurish ambitions forged what he believed
            would be a profitable business alliance-partnership with shrewd Cockney
            drifter-prostitute Mrs. Constance Miller (Best Actress Oscar-nominated
            Julie Christie) - she would be the madam of the whorehouse and with
            her business savvy, she would efficiently manage the prostitutes,
            with a promise to transform the initial tents into a classy and professional
            bordello within the soon-to-be booming town. She helped to stabilize
            the operation and make it a successful enterprise, but she was addicted
            to pipe-smoked opium, and she had sex with McCabe as a paying customer.
            Due to his lucky success, McCabe was confronted by representatives
            of the Harrison and Shaunessy Mining Company that wanted to buy him
            out for $5,500 (the offer was increased to $6,250), but he inexplicably
            turned them down. McCabe stubbornly refused to be bought out by the corporate zinc mining
            company. He then faced the ugly consequences - the appearance of
            three hired enforcers: gunmen Butler (Hugh Millais), Breed (Jace
            Vander Veen) and Kid (Manfred Schulz). In the
            final celebrated sequence of a lethal confrontation set during a
            snowstorm, McCabe temporarily and cowardly evaded their tracking
            by taking refuge in the church, then shot and killed the three men,
            but was mortally-wounded himself. McCabe succumbed alone in a snowdrift
            - a victim to big business, while Mrs. Miller succumbed to her addiction
            to her drugs. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Clint Eastwood<br />
              Clint Eastwood's first film as star and director was this  suspenseful,
        thrilling tale of psychotic sexual obsession. It
        was one of the first female stalker films, an early precursor to <i>Fatal
        Attraction (1987)</i>, and advertised with the tagline: &quot;The scream you hear may
        be your own!&quot; In the small town
        of Carmel, California, cool-talking, womanizing, all-night
        DJ on the jazzy, blues station KRML, mellow-voiced Dave Garver
        (Clint Eastwood) (or &quot;The Big D&quot;), would spin tunes each
          night for his audience of listeners. He received
        regular requests to play &quot;Misty&quot; - the Erroll
        Garner jazz classic, from the same &quot;groupie&quot; - his #
          1 fan - the seductive listener/fan Evelyn Draper (Jessica Walter).
           While relaxing with his long-time bartender-friend
            Murphy (director Don Siegel in a cameo) in his favorite local
            pickup bar, The Sardine Factory along Cannery
            Row in Monterey, Dave first met Evelyn face-to-face. They returned to his place
            for a no-strings attached one-night stand. At
            the same time, unexpectedly, Dave's  blonde ex-girlfriend Tobie Williams 
			(Donna Mills) had returned from Sausalito
            to Carmel after 4 months away. She had broken up with Dave (with
            a &quot;whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene&quot;) when
            concerned about his lack of commitment to her, although they would
            slowly rekindle their love. After Dave's one-night encounter,  the
            increasingly-disturbing, overbearing and obsessive behavior of psycho-stalker
            Evelyn had already begun to exhibit itself. She dropped in on him
            unexpectedly, stalked him, and even appeared at his door naked. When
            he became direct with her about ending the 'relationship,' she revealed
            her borderline and irrational personality problems and developing
            jealousy, distrust and anger, although then later apologized, but
            continued to pursue him. Evelyn even internalized
            the pain and attempted suicide by slitting her wrists in Dave's bathroom.
            Over time, he became more and more terrified
            and upset by her when she became increasingly volatile. She vandalized
            and destroyed his possessions in his home, and then she viciously
            slashed his cleaning woman Birdie (Clarice Taylor). The threat appeared
            to end when Evelyn was put away in a state sanitarium, but not for
            long. Meanwhile, Dave and Tobie had fallen madly in love with each
            other. After her release, Evelyn reappeared as a possessive, obsessive,
            murderous psychotic mad-woman - she approached him in his place with
            a butcher knife ready to stab him - but only stabbed his pillow.
            He evaded her and saved his life, but she escaped and
            then manipulatively became Tobie's new roommate named Annabel (taken
            from Edgar Allan Poe's poem 'Annabel Lee'). In the exciting, nail-biting
            climax, Dave rushed to Tobie's secluded home where Evelyn had taken
            Tobie as a hostage and was threatening her with a pair of scissors.
            Arriving just in time, Dave was also slashed, but was able to punch
             Evelyn in the jaw, sending her through both the balcony window and
            the wooden railing and plunging her down to her death, onto a rocky
            cliff and into the ocean far below. As the film ended, his taped
            radio program was heard playing 'Misty' - dedicated to Evelyn (whose
            body was floating in the Pacific surf). </font></p>        </td>

              filmmaker to direct a motion picture that was released by a major
              US studio - <i>The Learning Tree (1969)</i>. The esteemed, pioneering director's next
              film was this landmark crime-actioner  - the first
              major, commercial crime film with a black hero. It won an Oscar
              for Isaac Hayes' memorable theme song. The colorful, action-packed,
              slightly tongue-in-cheek film portrayed the ultra-hip, handsome,
              defiantly-proud police detective John Shaft (Richard Roundtree)
              as the black version of Clint Eastwood's &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; Callahan.
              He worked in Harlem against the Italian Mafia, and was also a &quot;sex
              machine.&quot; Parks' subversive film became a major cross-over hit in the early 70s,
              and from then on through the end of the decade, hundreds of films
              would be released by major and independent studios featuring major
              black characters (and some black athletes such as Jim Brown and
          Rosie Grier), to profit from the black movie-going audiences.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Straw Dogs (1971, UK), </b>118 minutes, D: Sam
          Peckinpah<br />
          Sam Peckinpah's unflinching, misogynistic vigilante thriller  further
          ignited controversy over realistic screen violence and sexual abuse
          of women in the early 70s. In its dramatic story, it told about a married
            couple in a contemporary, seemingly-peaceful and idyllic rural English
          town in a remote area of Cornwall. David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman), a
          bookish, mild-mannered, shy, pre-occupied, effete American mathematician
          was on sabbatical with his attractive and teasingly, sexually-provocative
          newly-wed English bride Amy (Susan George). He was preparing
            to write a book on the subject of astrophysics. The two had moved
          into and were renting her parents' old house and property known as
          Trencher's Farm near her hometown of Wakely; the ruined garage was
          in the process of being remodeled. In town, Amy's reacquaintance with
          her old, lecherous ex-boyfriend Charlie Venner (Del Henney) was a portent
          of future trouble. There were obvious problems
          in the improbable marriage between the two - he was withdrawn, neglectful
          and condescending to her and often over-intellectualized things, while
          she was more vivacious, realistic, child-like and free-spirited. To
            incite the sexual interest of local roof construction workers, including
            Charlie and two other bullies - ex-convict Norman Scutt (Ken Hutchinson)
              and Chris Cawsey (Jim Norton), Amy removed her sweater and deliberately
              stood topless in full view next to an upstairs window, although
              her husband had cautioned her: &quot;Don't
          forget to draw the curtains.&quot; The next troubling incident was David's discovery
              that Amy's pet cat had been strangled and was hanging by a cord
              in their bedroom closet. Amy immediately recognized the threat
              to their marriage - that the workers could easily enter their bedroom,
              and challenged her husband to confront the workers. The next day,
              instead of reprimanding and confronting the tough-talking, earthy
              locals, the ineffectual and hapless David sought their approval
          by drinking with them. Soon after, the workers
          pretended to be friends with David, and proposed to join him in a snipe
          hunting expedition into the woods; the hapless and cowardly David was
          fooled by the prank to lure him away, and found himself alone in a
          remote section of the moors. Meanwhile,
          in the scene preceding the rape (the first of two), the local laborer-thug
          Charlie was invited by Amy into her isolated farmhouse for a drink;
          he forcibly kissed her and although she protested unconvincingly (&quot;Please
          leave me&quot;), he removed her glasses and aggressively kissed her
            a second time. She screamed: &quot;Get out!&quot; and slapped
            him hard across the face. Incensed, he grabbed her and hit her
            hard across the mouth, and then approached her menacingly: &quot;Don't
            tease me, Amy. Please.&quot; He dragged her by the hair to the sofa, 
			as he struck her again
            and began tearing at her blue robe. He kissed her another time,
            and although she begged: &quot;Please, Charlie,&quot; he continued 
			to assault her by threatening, &quot;I
            don't want to leave you but I will.&quot; He tore her white top,
          leaving her breasts exposed, before he raped her. At
          first, she struggled and called out &quot;No,&quot; but then surrendered
          to his kisses. In some ways, she didn't resist but submitted, although
          she was under tremendous duress. When he held her down, ripped off
          her panties and began removing his shirt, she helplessly begged: &quot;Easy,&quot; and
            meanwhile fantasized about her husband above her. She showed
            obvious enjoyment and lovingly kissed her assailant and stroked
            his shoulders and chest during and after being entered, and begged
            for comfort: &quot;Hold me.&quot; However, she was also shedding
          tears, feeling both humiliated and disgraced. At the conclusion of
            the rape, Charlie was suddenly confronted by the barrel end of the
            shotgun pointed at him by his fellow workman Scutt. Scutt held
        Charlie at bay with a shortgun while he prepared to brutally assault
        David's wife in a graphic second rape sequence. Charlie
            was motioned to get off Amy - who screamed boisterously when she
            realized she was going to be forcibly raped a second time. Charlie
            was ordered to hold Amy down by the neck as she was violated again
        - from behind. In the film's climactic, stunning
        and barbaric bloodbath sequence, David was transformed from a meek, spineless,
              bullied and pacifist academic into a rampaging homicidal husband
              and protective home-owner to protect the sanctity of his domicile
              and wife (&quot;This is where I live. This is me. I will not allow
              violence against this house&quot;). He erupted cathartically with
              bloody violence after locals raped Amy and then as a drunken and
              armed group later laid siege to their house. The lynch mob threatened
              to invade the Sumner home in search of the mentally-deficient 'village
              idiot' named Henry Niles (David Warner), who had just killed a
              local flirtatious teenager named Janice Hedden (Sally Thomsett)
              and taken refuge in the house. David 
              retaliated against the assailants with vicious scalding using boiling
              oil, shotgun blasts, clubbing with a fireplace poker, and the use
              of an antique metal &quot;man trap&quot; to snap around Venner's neck - his
              retaliation was understandably redemptive yet mostly unsatisfying.
          As he surveyed the carnage, he exclaimed: &quot;Jesus, I beat 'em all.&quot; </font></p>        </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Summer of '42 (1971)</b>, 104 minutes, D: Robert
            Mulligan <br />
          Director Robert Mulligan's nostalgic, melancholy,
          war-time, New England beachside summer romance and coming-of-age
          tale featured Michel Legrand's recognizable, Oscar-winning
          dramatic score, some soft-focus cinematography, and an Academy
          Award nomination for Herman Raucher's Best Screenplay. The setting
          for the rites-of-passage romantic drama was the nostalgic atmosphere
          of 1940s Nantucket Island, seen in flashback 30 years later. It was
          narrated (with opening and closing comments) by the grown-up adult
          version of young, sensitive minded 15 year-old teenager Herman
          &quot;Hermie&quot; Raucher (Gary Grimes). During the summer of 1942,
            a time of war, Hermie and his two teenaged friends were vacationing
          with their families, visiting the island off the Eastern seaboard.
          A trio of sex-obsessed male friends included Hermie, the group's leader
          Oscar &quot;Oscy&quot; Seltzer (Jerry Houser), and nerdy, shy and immature Benjie
          (Oliver Conant). They often expressed their sexual awkardness and desire
          to lose their virginity, and perused sexual manuals to learn about
          sexual intercourse (and how to achieve it in 12 steps). Hermie hopelessly
          fell in love, at a distance with a neighbor - beautiful 22 year-old,
          newly-married war bride Dorothy (Jennifer O'Neill). He became acquainted
          with her by helping her to carry groceries, and by performing chores
          (such as moving boxes into the attic), after her recently-drafted husband
            departed for the war front. During a night at the movies (watching
            the romantic drama <a href="nowv.html"><i>Now, Voyager (1942)</i></a>),
            Hermie was with Aggie (Katherine Allentuck), while Oscy chose to
            accompany flirtatious Miriam (Christopher Norris); Benjie was too
            fearful of the opposite sex to stick around; during the film's screening,
            both Hermie and Oscy awkwardly made out with their young dates;
            humorously,  Hermie wrongly believed he
            was stroking his date's breast, but it was actually her arm. During
            one comical vignette, in preparation for a beach marshmallow roast
            (and possible sexual contact with their dates), Hermie was coaxed
            into nervously purchasing a condom from an unsympathetic storeowner.
            A tearjerking romance and sexual awakening occurred for Hermie when
            he visited Dorothy one evening. As he entered the dimly-lit house,
            a phonograph needle was stuck on a record; in the living room,
            he noticed a bottle of alcohol and a glass, and an ashtray stuffed
            with cigarette butts; he discovered that Dorothy had just learned
            via a government telegram that her husband had been killed in action
            (his plane was shot down over France). W ith
            tears in her eyes and slightly drunk, she put her head on Hermie's
            shoulder, and slowly danced (barefooted) with him to the tune (the
            film's theme song) playing on a phonograph record. She also tenderly
            kissed him a few times. After kissing him (as the phonograph needle
            reached the end of the record), with only the sound of the waves
            on the soundtrack, she wordlessly beckoned him. She took him by
            the hand, and led him to her bedroom for comfort, where she slowly
            removed her white slip over her head, prepared the bed, and then
            removed her bra and panties before they gently entered her bed
            naked together. When Hermie left her later
            that evening, she was outside on the porch in a robe, smoking a
            cigarette; she gave him a simple &quot;Good night, Hermie&quot; -
            and that was the last time he saw her. The
            next day, when Hermie returned to Dorothy's beach house, he saw
            that she had left a note for him (inside an envelope attached to
            the front door); he sat down on the porch to read it. She explained
            (in voice-over) that perhaps the meaning of the event would come
            to him in time, and she hoped that he would not face senseless tragedies
            in his life: (&quot;Dear Hermie:
            I must go home now. I'm sure you'll understand. There's much
            I have to do. I won't try and explain what happened last night
            because I know that, in time, you'll find a proper way in which
            to remember it. What I will do is remember you. And I pray that
            you be spared all senseless tragedies. I wish you good things,
            Hermie. Only good things. Always, Dorothy&quot;), to the swelling
            sounds of Michel Legrande's theme music. A 
            final bitter-sweet and sentimental voice-over came from the Narrator,
            middle-aged Herman Raucher (voice of Robert Mulligan), as he thought
            back to that fateful summer of 1942: &quot;I was never to see her
            again. Nor was I ever to learn what became of her. We were different
            then. Kids were different. It took us longer to understand the things
            we felt. Life is made up of small comings and goings. And for everything
            we take with us, there is something that we leave behind. In the
            summer of '42, we raided the Coast Guard station four times, we saw
            five movies, and had nine days of rain. Benji broke his watch, Oscy
            gave up the harmonica, and in a very special way, I lost Hermie
          forever.&quot;</font></p></td>

              97 minutes, D: Melvin Van Pebbles<br />
            Melvin Van Peebles served as financier, producer, writer, musical
            scorer, and star of his own low-budget first effort. Actor/director/writer
            Melvin Van Peebles' X-rated, confrontational cult film was the first
            true <i>blaxploitation</i> film - it was specifically designed to upset white audiences (advertised
            with &quot;Rated X by an All-White Jury&quot;), with Peebles himself playing the part
            of the sex-hungry, violent anti-hero. The successful independent
            film (budgeted at $150,000) was released by independent distributor
            Cinemation, and aimed at urban black audiences. It was an anti-White,
            anti-authority diatribe - explained in the film's opening: &quot;This
            film is dedicated to all the Brothers and Sisters who had enough
            of the Man...Starring: The Black Community.&quot; It caused tremendous
            controversy for its militancy, under-age sex, anti-white sentiment,
            revenge-themes, and violence, although it was one of the most important
            black American films of the decade. As the first commercially-successful
            black-themed film, Peebles forced Hollywood to acknowledge the monetary
            potential of the untapped, urban African-American market. There were
            many examples of jump-cuts, experimental lighting, freeze-frames,
            tinted and overlapping images and montages as it chronicled the successful
            (uncharacteristically) flight of a black fugitive nicknamed &quot;Sweet
            Sweetback&quot; (due to his large-sized manhood and insatiable sexual prowess) through
        Los Angeles - and toward and across the Mexican border. It was exceptional
        that a vengeful black man (after witnessing corrupt police violence and
        almost beating two officers to death) could survive as a fugitive, as
        happened in the film. </font></p></td>

          <p><b><font size="2">10 Rillington Place (1971, UK)</font></b><font size="2">,111 minutes, 
		  D: Richard Fleischer <br /> 
		  This was an exceptional biographical crime drama - a treatise against
            capital punishment, - with a tagline which asked the question:
			 &quot;What happened to the women at 10 Rillington
            Place?&quot; The story, set in London in 1949, was about a monstrous,
            psychopathic British serial killer named John Reginald Christie
            (Richard Attenborough). It first went back a few years in time
            to show how the notorious, soft-spoken Christie lured his female
            victims by impersonating a medical expert. He would knock them
            out (with gas), strangle and rape them, and then hide their corpses
            in his home or bury them in his garden. Then, it told about new
            tenants, dim-witted and illiterate Tim (John Hurt) and pregnant
            wife Beryl Evans (Judy Geeson) with a newborn named Geraldine,
            who rented rooms above apt. manager Christie's row-house apartment.
            Christie took advantage of the indigent and pregnant Beryl, who
            was desperate for an abortion (&quot;termination&quot;), with the
            help of his complicit wife Ethel (Pat Heywood). During the 'operation,'
            he raped and murdered Beryl, then framed the killing on Tim (who
            was convinced to flee by train), and also strangled the baby. When
            Tim was apprehended by police, he unaccountably confessed to both
            murders (with three signed confessions), without pressure or coercion
            - and he was charged with the killings. During the trial, a complete miscarriage
            of justice, there was powerful circumstantial evidence against
            Tim (he had approved his wife's abortion), while Christie denied
            any involvement (although evidence of his prior crimes of violence
            and theft demonstrated his lack of credibility). Most damning,
            Tim couldn't explain why he had confessed to a crime he didn't
            commit, and he was blamed for the killings. As an innocent man,
            he was unjustly sentenced to death, and although it was ruled that
            he was mentally incompetent, he was hanged in 1949. A few years
            later, graphic evidence surfaced that Christie was still murdering
            women (including his wife Ethel) and hiding bodies in his apartment.
            He was deemed responsible for the Evans' family killings. After
            Christie's trial, he was hanged to death in 1953. In the 1960s,
            Tim was given a posthumous official pardon (but his conviction
        remained on the books), and he was reburied.</font></p></td>

              95 minutes, D: Nicolas Roeg
        <br />
        Cinematographer Nicolas Roeg's first-directed film exhibited
          his visual story-telling roots. Two siblings became stranded in the
          hostile Australian outback after their father committed suicide. They
          faced a bleak future in the wild grip of nature, and were forced to
          struggle to survive in the hot desert sun outside of civilization.
          Their past  stark urban world of high-rises was contrasted
          with the visually stunning scenery and magnificent wildlife photography

          ending. </font></p></td>
