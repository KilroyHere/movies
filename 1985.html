            See series: <a href="series-backtothefuture.html"><em>Back to the
            Future (1985-1990)</em></a>.<br />
            Director Robert Zemeckis' witty, blockbuster science fiction adventure
            comedy/fantasy film was about a time-traveling teenager who had the
            opportunity to re-create and transform his parents - it was the highest-grossing
            film of its year. In the small town (fictional) of Hill Valley, CA, clean-cut,
            skateboarding teen &quot;Marty&quot; Seamus McFly (Michael J. Fox),
            who aspired to play guitar in a R&amp; R band, lived with his hapless
            middle-class parents: nerdy, cowardly, unhappy and weak-willed George
            McFly (Crispin Glover) who was bullied and tormented at work by his
            boss Bill Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), and his alcoholic, apathetic
            and depressed mother Lorraine Baines/McFly Lea Thompson). Marty's
            surrogate father figure, the madly-eccentric, wild-eyed, crackpot
            scientist Dr. Emmett &quot;Doc&quot;  Brown (Christopher Lloyd),
            conducted his first testing of his modified time-travel car at Twin
            Pines Mall in the early morning hours of October 26, 1985, with a
            travel destination dated November 5, 1955. The frizzy-haired Doc
            unveiled his time machine invention to Marty - it was a silver DeLorean
            car (with a &quot;flux capacitor&quot;), powered up to 1.21 gigawatts
            of electricity with an energy source of plutonium (that had been
            stolen from Libyan terrorists). The two witnessed Doc's
            dog Einstein's short one-minute time-travel trip into the future
            (&quot;temporal displacement&quot;) in the parking lot (at 88 mph),
            with Doc's ecstatic reaction. When the angry Libyan terrorists approached
            in a van, they shot and lethally-wounded Doc, but Marty was able
            to escape in the DeLorean - arriving 30 years earlier in 1955. In
             a mid-50s diner, Marty witnessed loutish bully Biff and his gang
            harrassing his future father, George; later, Marty tripped Biff and
            punched him in the face in the diner - and then fled. He created
            a makeshift skateboard (&quot;It's a board with wheels&quot;) - not
            yet invented - from a little boy's scooter and evaded the group chasing
            him on foot and in their car by hanging onto the back of a pickup
            truck. His actions had unintended consequences - his future mother,
            teenaged Lorraine Baines, was falling in love with him (&quot;He's
            an absolute dream&quot;). Without plutonium to return to the future,
            Marty met with a younger version of Doc, who advised him that the
            only available powerful energy source would be a bolt of lightning;
            Marty showed Doc a flyer from the future that reported an upcoming
            lightning strike that shattered the town's courthouse clock-tower.
            Still stuck in the year 1955, Marty attended his
            teenaged parents' 1955 &quot;Enchantment Under the Sea&quot;  prom
            night dance, where he attempted to encourage a romance between his
            future father and mother George and Lorraine (otherwise he would
            cease to exist in the 1980s). Marty played
            lead guitar and sang the 1950's rock 'n' roll song <i>Johnny B. Goode </i> [originally
            recorded by Chuck Berry in 1958] when the lead musician was put out
            of commission. To help Marty return &quot;back to the future&quot; of
            1985, the film's conclusion converged at the courthouse-town hall's
            tower (with a clock face). &quot;Doc&quot; Brown
            dangled from the clock face while attempting to reconnect the wires
            so that a bolt of electricity from a lightning strike would flow
            into the flux capacitor of the speedy DeLorean (that had to be traveling
            80 mph to make the time leap) occupied by Marty. Marty successfully
            returned to 1985 (ten minutes before his earlier departure), and &quot;Doc&quot; was
            saved from death in the Libyan terrorist attack by taking Marty's
            future advice by wearing a precautionary bullet-proof vest to protect
            him. After Marty was returned home, &quot;Doc&quot; took off to the
            future year of 2015, thirty years into the future. Marty realized
            that the present year of 1985 had now been drastically altered and
            transformed - Marty's parents (and his siblings) were now happy,
            physically in great shape and productively employed, and Biff had
            been demoted and served as George's valet. In the twist ending, &quot;Doc&quot; Brown
            suddenly returned to 1985 Hill Valley from the future year of 2015
            in his silver DeLorean time machine vehicle, shouting: &quot;Marty!

            better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88.&quot;  Doc
            smugly replied with a famous line: &quot;Roads? Where we're going,

              minutes, D: Terry Gilliam<br />
            Director Terry Gilliam's eccentric, offbeat, satirical ultra-dark
            comedy was a hybrid work, combining science-fiction, despairing ultra-black
          comedy and fantasy. It told
            about an oppressive and repressive, polluted, decaying future dystopian
             world of conformity, bureaucracy and Big Brother totalitarianism
            in a terrorist-threatened Londonesque metropolis. There were many
            visually-imaginative references to Kafka's <em>The
              Trial</em> (and Orson Welles' <i>The Trial (1962)</i>),
          Orwell's 1949 novel <em>1984</em> (and Michael Radford's <i>1984 (1984)</i>),
          and Anthony Burgess' 1962 <em>A
          Clockwork Orange</em> (and Stanley Kubrick's <a href="cloc.html"><i>A
          Clockwork Orange (1971)</i></a>). It had other similarities to Fritz
          Lang's mechanized society in <a href="metr.html"><i>Metropolis (1927)</i></a>,
          Kubrick's <a href="drst.html"><i>Dr.
          Strangelove: (1964)</i></a>, and the 'book-burning' of <i>Fahrenheit
          451 (1966)</i>. Mild-mannered
            and meek bureaucratic statistician Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), a
              low-ranking civil servant Everyman, worked in the regulatory Ministry
              of Information (MOI), jammed with paperwork and filled with endless
              pneumatic tubes and ill-functioning equipment. When a literal beetle
              was squashed in an office teletype printer and caused a typographical
              error that altered an arrest record, it unjustly identified an
              innocent citizen Mr. Archibald Buttle as suspected terrorist Archibald
          &quot;Harry&quot; Tuttle (Robert DeNiro). When Lowry investigated the case of
          mistaken identity (and the wrongful arrest and death of Buttle) and
          attempted to unravel it, he imagined himself as a lone heroic, silver-winged
              warrior knight-savior combating evil (ultimately embodied in the
          technological threats of the Machine Age). He would fly in the clouds
          toward a blonde fantasy-dream girl (Kim Griest), a doppelganger (a
          truck driver in the real world named Jill Layton (also Griest)) to
          rescue her and win her love. Jill's desire to help Mrs. Buttle sort
          out the error and find the real Mr. Buttle caused her to become
          regarded as a suspected terrorist and political dissident. Meanwhile,
          the self-deluded Sam became the subject of study by the totalitarian
          regime. His vain efforts to clear Jill's name ended
            when he was wrongly aligned with the rebellion, and his friend-turned-sinister
            MOI official Jack Lint (Michael Palin) arrested him for treason.
            He was detained in a large cylindrical room to be persecuted and
            tortured. A surrealistic fantasy ultimately saved him when he imagined
            himself escaping with the help of Tuttle and other resistance members,
            and leaving the city with Jill - in a happy ending - to an illusory
            idyllic paradise that was free of societal restrictions. However,
            it was all a delusional dream while he was strapped to a torture
            chair - and he died (as he hummed the film's theme song - Ary Barroso's &quot;Aquarela
          do Brasil&quot; or &quot;Brazil&quot;).</font></p>        </td>

              This masterful, sentimental and moving period drama, based on the
              Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Alice Walker, marked a major change
              from Spielberg's previous spate of escapist summer blockbusters.
              It garnered eleven Oscar nominations, although it suffered a record

              the forces of loneliness, poverty, and physical and emotional abuse.

              minutes, D. George A. Romero<br />
               Part 3 of Romero's original zombie trilogy. This third
              film was regarded as the most dialogue rich and the goriest in the
              original trilogy. The film cleverly set the genre on its head again,
              showing how the living dead were misunderstood and oppressed. With
              the character of semi-intelligent, humanized zombie &quot;Bub&quot; (Sherman
              Howard). Although not well received originally - and the lowest-grossing
              film of the three - it has since become a cult classic after revisionist
              thinking. In this sci-fi disaster film, 'undead' flesh-eating zombies
              had taken over the world (at a ratio of 400K to 1). Human survivors,
              including two competing groups: mad scientists (experimenting on
              hostile, specimen zombies) and the military (trigger-happy soldiers),
              were trapped inside a claustrophobic, underground missile silo installation,
              located in Florida. Fascistic, megalomaniac
                Captain Rhodes (Joseph Pilato) was in charge. In an era of Reaganite
                militaristic politics obsessed with science, this claustrophobic
                tale told of sadistic experiments performed on zombies in a subterranean
                bunker. Dr. Matthew Logan (Richard Liberty), known as &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; was experimenting with the domestication
                of zombies, while scientist Dr. Sarah Bowman (Lori Cardille) was struggling
                to find a cure for the apocalyptic plague and epidemic of undead swarming
                throughout the country. Its climax was non-stop dismemberment, disembowelment,
                and beheadings, as the zombies took over the complex. Rhodes was ripped
                apart at the waist by the undead creatures. He defiantly yelled out with
        his intestines exposed: &quot;Choke on 'em!&quot;</font></p></td>

          </font><font size="2">This early
            Joe Eszterhas-penned courtroom thriller and mystery 'who-dun-it'
            contained a number of unpredictable surprises and twists. In the
            film's opening, set during a thunderstorm in San Francisco at a
            remote beach house, wealthy socialite/heiress Mrs. Paige Forrester
            (Maria Mayenzet) was murdered by a hooded, unidentified attacker
            (with a ski mask and black leather clothing) who wielded a jagged-edged
            knife blade and slit her throat. The word &quot;Bitch&quot; was
            scrawled in blood on the bedroom wall. A maid was also killed
            (off-screen), and her husband Jack Forrester (Jeff Bridges) also
            suffered a head wound. However, Jack became a prime suspect and
            was arrested on charges of double homicide after prosecutor Thomas
            Krasny (Peter Coyote) learned that he was to inherit his wife's
            entire <i>SF Times</i> publishing empire
            fortune. Forrester was also suspected when a jagged hunting knife
            was seen in his country club gym locker (# 122) by janitor Fabrizi
            (Louis Giambalvo). Ex-prosecutor and civil rights litigator with
            a high success rate, Teddy Barnes (Glenn Close), a divorced mother
            with two children, agreed to defend Forrester when a lie detector
            test proved positive. Things became much more complicated when
            Teddy began a passionate affair with her handsome client. During
            the case preparations, Krasny suspected that Jack's head wound
            was self-inflicted. Barnes' office began to receive anonymous typewritten
            notes (from a 1942 Corona typewriter), including clues about the
            case, and statements that Forrester was innocent. The judge in
            the case was Judge Carrigan (John Dehner). </font><font size="2">Prosecutor
              Krasny revealed that if Paige had divorced Jack, which was her
              intention (since they were both unfaithful to each other), Jack
              wouldn't have received the fortune. Pretty Virginia Howell (Leigh
              Taylor-Young) admitted that she had tried to have sex with Jack,
              but was jilted. Tennis pro Bobby Slade (Marshall Colt) testified
              that he had slept with Mrs. Forrester, and used the word &quot;Bitch&quot; to describe her.
              Another tennis club member admitted to having a jagged knife in
              his locker (# 222). Surprise defense witness Julie Jensen (Karen
              Austin), referred to one of the typed clue-notes, testified that
              18 months earlier, she was attacked in the same manner as Paige
              Forrester - to prove that the defendant committed the similarly
              charged crime. However, Forrester was found not guilty. Soon after,
              Barnes found an incriminating typewriter (with a unique typeface
              including elevated 't's', that were found in all of the anonymous
              letters) in Forrester's closet, and confronted him with the information.
              In the nail-biting conclusion, a ski-masked figure entered her
              bedroom late at night with the murder weapon - a jagged-edged knife.
              She was ready for him - she shot him a number of times with a concealed
              gun. When he was unmasked by detective Sam Ransom (Robert Loggia),
              it was revealed that it was Jack who was the attacker (Ransom: &quot;F--k

              minutes, D: Hector Babenco<br />
              Argentinian-born director Hector Babenco's Brazilian/American co-produced
              melodramatic R-rated film, was a small independent film based
              upon Manuel Puig's 1976 novel. It was historically important as
              one of the first (if not first) gay films that was heralded by
              the mainstream media.  Its major themes were gender roles, toleration
              of differences, escapism from reality through fantasy, oppression,
              political idealism, and betrayal. Two
          major cellmates - both 2nd class citizens living in a repressive political
          dictatorship, developed a deep friendship while they were incarcerated
          in the 1970s in a South American (Brazilian) prison (Pavilhao IV).
              They were Luis Molina (William Hurt with a Best Actor-winning performance) - a flamboyant,
          effeminate, tall, 41 year-old homosexual sex offender accused and convicted
          of &quot;corrupting a minor&quot; and sentenced to an 8-year prison
          term. He was a long, red tinted-haired drag queen and a great story-teller,
          and a former department store window-dresser. The second man was Valentin
          Arregui (Raul Julia) - a bearded, 34 year-old cynical political prisoner,
          leftist journalist and radical Marxist revolutionary 
          who was jailed for inciting political unrest against the repressive
          government and became a martyr for the movement. Molina
          often entertained the two of them by fancifully escaping their predicament
          in prison and passing the time through story-telling. Molina continued to 
		  describe his fond memories of an old noirish B-film
          - a 1940s, anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda film. The remembered film -
          framed as a &quot;film-within-a-film&quot; - was shown as interspersed,
          sepia-toned &quot;clips.&quot; It was a romantic
          thriller in which Leni Lamaison (Sonia Braga), during the Vichy-era
          French Resistance, fell  in love with dashing
          and blonde Aryan officer Werner (Herson Capri) - Chief of Counter-Intelligence
          in France and an enemy Nazi SS soldier. Leni was portrayed as a <i>femme
          fatale</i> Spider-Woman - &quot;the most ravishing woman in the world.&quot; Other
          characters included  patriot leader Clubfoot
          (Ant&ocirc;nio Petrin), and nightclub cigarette girl Michele (Denise
          Dummont). In Molina's film tale, Michele lost
          her life when she was deliberately run over by Clubfoot for engaging
          in a love affair with German lieutenant Hanschen. After Michele's death,
          Leni was reluctantly pressured by the rebels to acquire a secret map
          to the German arsenal from her lover Werner. She was romanced by Werner
          in his luxurious chateau, and fell in love with him, but realized she
          must betray him since he was in charge of executing Resistance patriots.
          At the end of the Nazi film,  Leni was about
          to betray him in the dark castle of a Resistance leader (Nildo Parente)
          by turning over the secret map. In a surprise
          twist, when the sex-hungry Resistance leader assaulted her, she stabbed
          him in the back with a steak knife. She fled and rushed into Werner's
          embrace and kissed him, but then was shot by another dying patriot
          named Flunky (Wilson Grey) and perished in Werner's arms. During
          Molina's interspersed film scene descriptions, Valentin was disgusted
          and repelled by both Molina's self-hating homosexuality (&quot;You
          damn faggot!&quot;)
          and his trivial romanticization of Nazi fascist propaganda. The
          film's plot twist was that in prison as he befriended Valentin, Molina
          was actually working undercover with the prison's corrupt Warden (Jos&eacute; Lewgoy)
          and abusive, homophobic secret police officer Pedro (Milton Gon&ccedil;alves). Molina's
          objective was to cautiously gather vital information from Valentin
          to help identify other traitors, accomplices, and anti-government groups.
          In exchange for betraying Valentin (&quot;The quicker he talks, the
          quicker you get out&quot;), he bargained for food and for early parole. Just
          before being paroled, Molina imagined and spun a new film tale (with
          a bluish-purple tint) of tropical romance on a desert island - an allegorical
          tale about the two of them. The central character was a masked &quot;strange
          woman&quot; (again Sonia Braga) with a black gown, who &quot;was caught
          in a giant spider web that grew from her own body.&quot; One
          night when a shipwrecked man (portrayed by Raul Julia) drifted onto
          the beach, she cared for him, &quot;nourished him with love,&quot; and
          brought him back to life. Gradually, the two
          prisoners had also become unlikely compatriots who ultimately developed
          compassion for each other. Molina was increasingly feeling conflicted
          about his deal to betray Valentin after falling in love with this &quot;real
          man.&quot; When Molina suggested that they make love on his last night in prison,
          Valentin complied, and they came together in the dark (off-screen). The
          film concluded with Molina's release (and a farewell kiss from Valentin).
          Molina was melancholy after his return to society and to his mother
          (M&iacute;riam Pires), as he often sat
              silent at a bay window looking out at the city. He was unaware
              that he was under surveillance by agents who wanted him to lead
          them to the cadre of Valentin Arregui. Finally,
          he mustered the courage to make contact with the rebels (with a secret
          message from Valentin). He phoned from a subway pay-phone, and then
          withdrew wads of cash from his bank account to provide for his mother's
          care. After bidding goodbye to his mother, he wore a tell-tale red
          scarf to signal his identification to the rebels. In
          the city streets and the busy town square, Molina was pursued by Pedro
          and other agents, as he made contact with Valentin's girlfriend Lidia
          (Ana Maria Braga) in a taxi. Gunfire erupted when the agents charged
          forward. Lidia's taxi took off as Molina fled from the agents. The
          taxi reappeared, and Lidia - who suspected he was an informant, shot
          and mortally-wounded Molina in the chest before racing away. His death
          mirrored the death of his heroine Leni in the Nazi propaganda film. He
          was thrust into a car at gunpoint by Pedro and while he was dying,
          Molina self-sacrificially and heroically refused to divulge the phone
          number. Once his body went limp, he was dumped onto a pile of trash
          in a shanty-town. The authorities spread a false story about how he
          had collaborated with the extremist revolutionaries and was shot dead
          by them. The same fate also arrived for Valentin back in prison
              - where he had been tortured mercilessly with electricity. A prison
              intern-medic in the infirmary decided to inject him with a potent
              overdose of a pain-killer (morphine), to release him into the escapist
              world of film (into a romantic paradise). His death was a replay
          of the short 'Spider Woman' film described earlier by Molina. As he
          appeared to possibly die in a fanciful delirium, Valentin's former
          lover Marta (Sonia Braja) came to him, happily ran with him hand-in-hand
          out of the prison, and brought him - as the Spider Woman - to the idyllic
          desert island setting where he was miraculously healed and she assured
          him after kissing: &quot;This
          dream is short, but this dream is happy.&quot;</font></p>          </td>

              Pollack<br />
              Sydney Pollack's grandly-spectacular, handsome biopic romance,
              a Best Picture winner with Oscar-winning John Barry's marvelous
              score, harkened back to the old-style, sweeping epics of the 50s
              and 60s. The extravagant travelogue-romance was based by Kurt Luedtke
              on the life, works, and memoirs of Karen Blixen (a Danish writer
              who published under the pen-name Isak Dinesen). Spanning
              two decades in the early 20th century, the love pairing between
              its two major stars was very much embellished and put at the center
              of the story. The love story in the romantic biopic, similar
              in scope to David Lean's sprawling epics, was easily eclipsed by
              the more compelling, Oscar-winning, visually-poetic cinematography
              of exotic locations from beginning to end - an awesome, wonderful
              feast for the eyes. Meryl Streep portrayed the Danish Baroness who married
            and settled on a British East Africa coffee plantation with her
            disinterested philandering husband Bror Blixen (Klaus Maria Brandauer)
            who infected her with syphilis before leaving. Interlaced with
            gorgeous, lyrically-beautiful scenes on location in Kenya, Karen
            spent idyllic romantic days during a brief passionate affair with
            white game-hunter Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford) (modified
            to be American instead of British) - holding hands with him in
            a biplane, and having her hair shampooed by him during a safari.
            The highlight of the film was the safari, with many majestic
            views of the African plains with streaming herds of wildlife - photographed
          both from ground level and from a biplane. Although their relationship
              heated up, his demands for personal freedom doomed full commitment.
              The film came full circle as just before Karen was planning to
              return home, she attended Denys' funeral when he lost his life
            in a tragic plane crash. </font></p>        </td>

              a dedicated, proud and unquestioning hit-man for the powerful Prizzi

            minutes, D. Stuart Gordon<br />
          A low-budget, horror comedy, and cult film favorite,
          similar to the <i>Frankenstein</i> tale. An adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's
            early 1920s serial novella <i>Herbert West: Re-Animator</i>. After
            controversial medical experiments in Switzerland, corpse-reviving,
            nerdy medical student Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) enrolled in Miskatonic
            University. He resumed his obsessive experiments with bringing corpses
            (and body parts) to life, with the help of Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott),
            a fellow co-worker/student and apartment roommate. West had developed
            a glowing green serum or reagent to regenerate life, first successfully
            demonstrated on Dan's dead cat Rufus. Dan reported Herbert to Dr.
            Alan Halsey (Robert Sampson), the Head or Dean of the medical school,
            and promptly had his student grant suspended and was barred from
            the school. Now under cover, Dan joined Herbert to prove the formula
            worked, using bodies from the school morgue. However, the reanimated
            corpses became violent, frenzied and blood-thirsty zombies. And one
            of them savagely attacked and killed Dean Halsey. Now that Halsey
            was a zombie, West's jealous and blackmailing superior and rival,
            brain surgeon Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale), operated on the Dean's
            zombie corpse, to attempt to steal West's work. In the climactic
            ending, Dr. Hill was decapitated by West, but then after reanimating
            - Hill sexually forced his headless self upon Dan's kidnapped fiancee,
            Megan Halsey (scream queen Barbara Crampton), daughter of the Dean,
            who was strapped nude to an operating table. In the amazing scene,
            the decapitated Dr. Carl Hill (carrying his own disembodied head)
            had oral sex (&quot;head&quot;) with Megan.
            A free-for-all battle of reanimated, mind-controlled, beserk zombies
            led to the death of Megan (who was injected with the reagent and
        brought back to life). </font></p></td>

                loosely on George Romero's <i><a href="nightoflivingdead.html">Night
                  of the Living Dead (1968)</a></i>,
                about ghouls rising from
                the dead. With a heavy-metal
                punkish soundtrack. Created
                variations or new &quot;rules&quot;
          for Romero's zombies - the creatures could talk, walk at normal
          speeds, and they were more indestructible. The
          film began with the premise,
          told by Uneeda Medical Supply
          warehouse foreman Frank (James
          Karen) to new teen employee
          Freddy (Thom Matthews) that
          George Romero's cultish 1968
          hit was based on a real-life
          incident. Frank described
          a chemical spill at a VA
          hospital that leaked into
          a morgue and reanimated all
          of the dead bodies. He then
          told how there was a military
          cover-up, and the reanimated
          bodies were shipped off for
          storage, and because of various
          blunders, the bodies accidentally
          came to their warehouse.
          When showing Freddy an old
          Army military drum of deadly
          toxic gas (that caused the
          dead to rise up) in the basement,
          Frank accidentally ruptured
          it - and released a deadly
          toxic gas, and animated a
          frozen cadaver in the facility.
          Boss Burt Wilson (Clu Gulager)
          recommended that they kill
          the cadaver, when Frank asked
          about the inherent difficulty
          in killing something already
          dead. Frank responded: &quot;It's
                not a bad question, Burt.&quot; When
                they cremated the attacking,

              Director Peter Masterson's sentimental and well-crafted, old-fashioned
              Americana family drama (and road film) was scripted by screenwriter
              Horton Foote who had adapted his own 1953 NBC-TV and Broadway play
              (featuring silent film actress Lillian Gish) into the film. Under
              the opening title credits, a mother and her young son ran 
			  through a field of bluebonnets. The
            &quot;sleeper film&quot; was set - flash-forward - in the late 1940s
            following WWII, beginning in the city of Houston, TX, where elderly
            but spirited, hymn-singing mother-in-law
            &quot;Mama&quot; - Mrs. Carrie Watts (Geraldine Page in a magnificent
            Best Actress winning performance) - was forced to live in the cramped
            apartment of her striving, put-upon, hard-luck son Ludie Watts
            (John Heard) and his shrill, nagging and self-centered, vain and
            controlling wife Jessie Mae (Carlin Glynn), who greedily pursued
            Carrie's monthly pension check. The crafty and stubborn-minded
            Mrs. Watts was determined to visit her childhood farm home in the
            Gulf coastal (fictitious) town of Bountiful, TX (between Houston
            and Corpus Christi) that she had not seen for 20 years, but had
            always been denied the trip by her protective son due to her age
            (and the trip's cost). One morning, she quickly packed her things
            and took a city bus to the train station, but eventually ended
            up in a Greyhound bus depot where she purchased a ticket to Harrison,
            TX (another fictional town), the nearest stop to Bountiful. She
            evaded and outwitted Ludie's and Jessie Mae's search for her in
            the depot and found herself befriended by a young, grieving fellow
            passenger named Thelma (Rebecca de Mornay), whose husband was serving
            in the military. She shared many emotional thoughts, including
            how she didn't love her husband, and hadn't been allowed by her
            father to marry her real love. After finally reaching her destination
            late at night, she was still 12 miles from Bountiful, and learned
            from the stationmaster Roy (Kevin Cooney) that her best friend
            from Bountiful, the town's last remaining resident, had died two
            days earlier. A search had been initiated for her by her son, prompting
            the local Sheriff (Richard Bradford) to detain her at the depot.
            When &quot;Mama&quot; calmed down, the kindly and 
			considerate Sheriff volunteered to drive the
            yearning Mrs. Watts to her farm-home in the interim, to take her
            out to the 'ghost town' and her deserted and dilapidated house,
            overgrown with weeds. She recalled many memories to the Sheriff,
            including: &quot;I don't know of anything prettier, than a scissortail flyin'
            through the sky!&quot; She was ultimately able to reconcile with
            herself and find peace and happiness within herself that she had
            finally been able to visit her homeland before she died. Her son
            and daughter-in-law arrived to pick her up at the home. &quot;Mama&quot; listened
            as Ludie also called up old memories of the home, and confessed
            that he had repressed his own troubled and painful memories of his
            childhood. He also was saddened that he had not had children. As
            the group walked back to the car, after Jessie Mae had read off a
            list of house rules for &quot;Mama&quot;
            to follow, Ludie finally expressed his anger toward his wife. He
            insisted and resolved that they would not wrangle
            anymore with each other and live more tolerantly and peacefully
            together. Just before reaching the car, &quot;Mama&quot; sat down
        in the grass and said goodbye to Bountiful.</font></p>
