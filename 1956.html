        <p><font size="2"><b>Anastasia (1956)</b>, 105 minutes, D: Anatole Litvak</font><br />
          <font size="2">Director Anatole Litvak's and 20th Century Fox's dramatic
          biopic was a fictionalized account of how an
          amnesiac woman named &quot;Anna Anderson&quot; had appeared as an inmate
          in a Berlin asylum in the 1920s, and claimed
          to be Grand Duchess Anastasia Romanov (a surviving daughter of Tsar
          Nicholas II of Russia) after the Russian Revolution. In the film, Anna
          was manipulated and used by others to claim her inheritance of &pound;10
          million pounds. The film's opening prologue
          explained (in part): &quot;A woman appeared, a woman who was said to
              be the youngest daughter of the last Tsar, her Imperial Highness,
              the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Only she, if she is still alive, knows
          the truth behind the story you are about to see.&quot; The main setting
          was 1928 in Paris where Gen.
          Sergei Pavlovich Bounine (Yul Brynner), working with two 
		  scheming acolytes-partners banker
          Boris Adreivich Chernov (Akim Tamiroff) and former theological student
          Piotr Ivanovich Petrovin (Sacha Pitoeff), were alerted to a coughing,
          destitute and sick amnesiac woman out on the street. She had just
          been released from the St. Cloud asylum (&quot;madhouse&quot;) where
          reportedly, the woman had told one of the attendant nuns that she was
          the Grand Duchess Anastasia from ten years earlier. 
              Bounine's  ultimate goal in a scam was to acquire the &pound; 10
              million pound inheritance - Anastasia's father Tsar Nicholas II's
              bounty money that was currently frozen in the Bank of England.
              They groomed and  manipulated Anna to present
              her as the real &quot;Anastasia.&quot; They had to convince others,
              including investors and stockholders in their business enterprise,
               that she had miraculously escaped and
              hadn't been executed with the rest of the family in 1918 by the
              Bolsheviks. During her training, Anna awoke
              one night screaming about her lack of an identity: &quot;I don't
              know who I am any more!&quot; The General's last-ditch manipulative
              effort was to &quot;go
              to the top&quot; - and introduce Anna to Anastasia's highly-skeptical
              elderly grandmother the Dowager Empress, Maria Feodorovna (Helen
              Hayes) who resided in Copenhagen, Denmark, to further confirm her
              identity and legitimacy. A meeting was orchestrated at the Royal
              Theater between Anna and  Prince Paul von Haraldberg (Ivan
              Desny), the Empress' nephew and Anastasia's betrothed when she
              was 16 years old. Their staged romance was designed to encourage
              his stubborn-minded Aunt to meet Anna, although she suspected that
              Anna was an imposter being promoted by the General. The ploy seemed
              to work - the Empress soon after unexpectedly appeared to speak
              to Anna in her hotel room. Anna pleaded that she wasn't melodramatically
              faking her identity as the Empress' lost grand-daughter; the Empress'
              feelings were stirred but she was still reticent to believe, until
              Anna mentioned that she coughed when frightened, as Anastasia used
              to do as a child. The Empress  embraced Anna and
              accepted her as the true Grand Duchess. After returning to Paris
              a few weeks later, there were marriage-engagement rumors (between
              Prince Paul and Anna); the Empress and His Highness Prince
              Paul had arrived by train for the official presentation ceremony
              and announcement. Before the evening's ceremony scheduled at their
              hotel, Anna sensed that Bounine was now jealous of her new-found
              identity as the Grand Duchess. Anna
              agreed with him that all she had ever wanted was to find out who
              she was. Bounine also had harsh and sarcastic words about the fortune-hunting
              Prince Paul. Behind the scenes, Bounine met with the Empress
              and told her that he planned to depart before the pronouncement
              of the engagement: &quot;I want no further part in it&quot;; she
              thanked him for bringing everyone together. Bounine  bluntly admitted
              that he was personally &quot;not pleased&quot; with
              the outcome. The Empress called Anna aside, while she ordered
              that Bounine was to wait in the nearby green-room. 
              She directly asked Anna if she truly loved the Prince - her 
              equivocating and indecisive answer convinced the Empress that Bounine
              was the only one who was truly in love with Anna, not the Prince.
              The Empress facilitated their escape and the two vanished from
              the green-room before Anna was to be presented to everyone. Paul
              seemed to realize that Anna was not the true Anastasia: (&quot;She
              was not Anastasia after all&quot;). As the Prince escorted the

        (Apu Trilogy 2)</b>, 110 minutes, D: Satyajit Ray <br />
          Legendary Indian director Satyajit Ray's humanistic
          and evocative drama was a follow-up film to the first film in the &quot;Apu
          Trilogy&quot; - <i>Pather Panchali (1955)</i>, that was followed by <i>The
          World of Apu (1959) (aka Apur Sansar)</i>. In the previous film, 10
          year-old Apu (Subir Banerjee) was living with his Brahmin priest-father
          Harihar Ray (Kanu Bannerjee) and mother Sarbojaya Ray (Karuna Bannerjee)
          in a bamboo forest, under difficult conditions, especially after the
          death of Apu's sister. In  1920, the family - with their 10 year-old
          son Apu (Pinaki Sengupta as youth) moved from their &quot;ancestral
          home&quot; by train to the holy Indian city of Benares on the banks
          of the Ganges River. Apu's priest-father
          sang and recited holy Hindu scriptures for worshippers as the family's
          only income, while his overworked mother tended to house duties. Struggling
          with poverty and harsh conditions, Harihar suddenly and mysteriously
          fell feverish and ill, and died. It was now to
          be assumed that Apu - as a Brahmin boy, would become an apprentice
          priest. However, there was no longer any means of financial support
          for the family, although Apu's prideful mother briefly served as a
          maid and cooked for a wealthy Bengali family.  After a short period
          of indecision, Apu's mother finally decided to accept a long-standing
          invitation to move to the small Bengali village of Mansapota, to stay
          in the home of her elderly great-uncle Bhabataran (Ramani Sengupta).
          While there, the restless Apu finally persuaded his mother to let him
          attend the local westernized, British-influenced school in the afternoons.
          Apu obviously impressed everyone with his love of knowledge and seemed
          to have a promising future as a student. For being second in the District,
          the Headmaster  (Subodh Ganguli) offered the now-teenaged Apu (Smaran
          Ghosal as adolescent) a scholarship of ten rupees a month to go to
          a prestigious university in Calcutta (aka Kolkata). His mother was
          enthralled by her son's progress, but also reticent and upset that
          the excited, teenaged Apu would be leaving her to find his new destiny.
          Apu prepared to set out to Calcutta with help from his mother to pack
          his suitcase. She also gave him two
          postcards and pleaded with him to write to her once he arrived. 
          He walked to the train station with his suitcase and a miniature globe,
          with one glance backwards. In  the big city of Calcutta after a 3-hr.
          train trip, Apu took lodging with a printer named Akhil (Kali Roy)
          and studied science at college during the day; he also worked at the
          printer's Royal Press business at night with a printing press job
          in exchange for rent. It was inevitable that he would become
          distant from his mother, although he did visit her for a short
          period. One evening during the visit, she proposed 
          that she could move to be with him - and then asked if he would one
          day take care of her, but she realized that he had
          fallen asleep and hadn't heard anything she had said. The film concluded
          with Apu receiving a letter from his anxious and very despondent mother: &quot;Why
          don't you write regularly? I worry when I don't hear from you&quot;;
          she begged for him to visit again since she hadn't seen him in two
          months (&quot;I long to see you&quot;). He wrote a letter to respond,
          saying that his studies would suffer if he left Calcutta. Upon reading
          Apu's reply-letter, Sarbojaya looked mournful, lonely and sick. She
          turned feverish and her health was quickly deteriorating. Her
          death was symbolized by the dimming and extinguishing lights of fireflies
          at dusk. News of Apu's mother's illness arrived from neighbors. Once
          Apu arrived home, he found out that he was too late - she was already
          dead. With the sad realization that his mother was gone, Apu sank down
          by the roots of a tree and began to cry. Apu was determined to move
          on, however, and was viewed from behind by the camera in a long-shot,
          as he walked to the train station under cloudy skies to return by train
          to his modern-day studies in Calcutta. </font></p>        </td>

              D: Michael Anderson<br />
              In producer Michael Todd's and British director Michael Anderson's
              Best Picture-winning, exciting globe-trotting travelogue - a three-hour
              epic and adaptation of  Jules Verne's 1872 classic escapist adventure
              novel, was about a proper, eccentric Victorian/English gentleman
              Phileas Fogg who made a financial wager about circumventing the
              globe (by every means of transportation including balloon, train,
              stagecoach, ostrich-rickshaw, steamship,  elephant, etc.); it was
              the largest scale film ever made - created with Todd-AO, a special
              wide-screen format. The film featured almost 69,000 extras
          and thousands of animals including sheep, buffalo, donkeys, horses,
          monkeys, bulls, elephants, skunks, and ostriches! The film also used
          140 sets built at six Hollywood studios (as well as on location shoots
              in England, Hong Kong and Japan). There were many major big-name
              Hollywood and international stars, including David Niven as the
              traveling gentleman, Cantinflas (in his American film debut as
              valet Passepartout), Shirley MacLaine (as a rescued Indian princess),
              and Robert Newton (as a pursuing detective). It also featured a
              globe-trotting ensemble cast in over four-dozen cameo appearances.
              In the film's 10-minute introduction-prologue set in an office-library,
              reporter Edward R. Murrow (as Himself) narrated as he paid homage
              to Jules Verne's novel. He also spoke about another shorter Verne
              book published in 1865, <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i>, that
              inspired the first science fiction film - a short directed by Georges
              Melies, titled <i><a href="voya.html">Le Voyage Dans La Lune (1902,
              Fr.)</a></i>. In the film's opening set in the Victorian Era in
            England, weathly gentleman Phileas Fogg (David Niven) was introduced
            living a modest and solitary life; he was known for being meticulous
              and punctual about everything. While playing a card game of whist
              with other members of London's Reform Club, the arrogant-minded
              Fogg wagered &pound; 20,000 pounds with fellow gentlemen  in the
              club that he could circumnavigate the globe in 80 days. He believed
              he could  return to his starting point at the Reform
              Club on Saturday, September 21st at the same time, 8:45 pm. He
              immediately began his 'around-the-world' adventure tour  with his
              new, resourceful Latin-American manservant-butler Passepartout
              (Mexican actor Cantinflas). The journey began from London via a
              train bound for Dover and Calais (Northern France coast) to Paris,
              and from there, the two were forced to travel via  a purchased
              hot-air balloon that drifted off-course and crossed the Alps to
              Spain, where Passepartout engaged in a bull-fight. Throughout the
              film, it was suspected that Fogg has stolen his wagered money from
              the Bank of England. From Spain, the two travelers caught the <i>R.M.S.
              Mongolia</i> steamer through the Suez and onward to the west coast
              of India (mostly off-screen). On   the Great India Peninsula
              Railway from Bombay on their way to Calcutta, they discovered that
              about 50 miles of the railway tracks to Allahabad were not completed
              as previously reported, so Fogg was forced to hire an elephant
              and guide to proceed. Along the way, they rescued Princess Aouda
              (Shirley MacLaine) who was about to be ritualistically sacrificed.
              From Calcutta, they took the <i>S.S. Rangoon</i> steamer to cross
              the Bay of Bengal, passing Thailand, and then traversing across
              the South China Sea to Hong Kong (with streets filled with rickshaws
              pulled by ostrichs); then, they crossed the East China Sea on the <i>S.S.
              Carnatic</i> - passing Shanghai, China and docking in Yokohama,
              Japan before setting sail on the majestic clipper ship - the <i>S.S.
              General Grant</i> (during
              intermission) to San Francisco. After a short evening in a Barbary
              Coast saloon, they took a trans-continental
              train to traverse the frontier of the US, with obstacles including
              an unstable suspension bridge and threatening Sioux Indians. They
              inventively rigged up a sail-powered train cart to proceed from
              Nebraska to Chicago, where they planned to board a train to NYC,
              but once they arrived in the city, they were too late for their
              scheduled eastbound Cunard steamship  <i>China</i>. The group was
              forced to commandeer a coal-burning trading steamship - the <i>S.S.
              Henrietta</i> bound
              for Caracas, Venezuela; they redirected it to Liverpool, England.
              Upon their departure from Liverpool to London by train, Scotland
              Yard Inspector Fix (Robert Newton) arrested Fogg for allegedly
              robbing &pound; 55,000 pounds from the Bank of England on July
              3rd. Fogg was released when the &quot;real culprit&quot; was arrested
              in Brighton, but they had lost valuable time, and once they arrived
              at Fogg's home in London, they believed that they were too late
              and had forfeited the wager. However, Passepartout and Fogg suddenly
              realized that it was actually Saturday - since they had traveled
              Eastward across the International Date Line and saved one day,
              and still had time to get to the Reform Club. Fogg arrived at the
              club punctually at 8:45 pm to win the wager, but the gentlemen
              were more concerned about the Princess entering their exclusive
              mens-only club than the bet itself! </font></p>        </td>

              114 minutes, D: Elia Kazan<br />
            Director Elia Kazan's landmark, tragi-comedy film - one of the most
            erotic cinematic works ever produced, was based on Tennessee Williams'
            first original film screenplay, interweaving and adapting two of
            his earlier one-act plays: &quot;Twenty-Seven Wagons Full of Cotton&quot; and &quot;The
            Long Stay Cut Short&quot; (aka &quot;The Unsatisfactory Supper&quot;).  To
              make the film appear more genuine and authentic, most of it was
              filmed on location in Benoit, MS.   Its advertisements
            and posters featured a sultry young &quot;Baby Doll&quot; curled
            up in a crib in a suggestive pose, sucking her thumb. The
            stark, controversial, black and white film was so viciously denounced
            by the Legion of Decency upon its release that many theaters were
            forced to cancel their showings, but it still did moderately well
            at the box office despite the uproar. Its themes were  moral decay,
            lust, sexual repression, seduction, infantile eroticism and the corruption
            of the human soul. In the story, rural, middle-aged, 
              deeply-indebted Mississipian and cotton gin operator
             Archie Lee Meighan (Karl Malden) had just married thumb-sucking,
            white-trash, naive, uneducated 19 year-old 'baby doll' child bride &quot;Baby
            Doll&quot; Meighan (Carroll Baker, 25 years old and in her second film). His mental
            state was degenerating (and he had become lecherous and voyeuristic)
            due to his constant sexual-frustration that their marriage wouldn't
            be consummated until her 20th birthday - two days away as the film
            opened. Archie was literally ruled by his stuck-up, spoiled, child
            bride. Archie's vengeful and competitive business rival was a covetous,
            wily, sleek, beady-eyed and cocky Sicilian named Silva Vacarro (Eli
            Wallach). He was the unscrupulous business-manager of the up-and-coming
            Syndicate Plantation and Gin Company that had stolen away all of
            Archie's business. To retaliate against his competitor, Archie took
            a kerosene can and set the Syndicate gin building on fire. While
            awaiting the ginning of his 27 wagon loads of cotton at Archie's
            once-grand plantation manor, Vacarro's main
            aim was to deflower Archie's child bride as revenge for arson of
            his business. Behind Archie's back, there were numerous cat-and-mouse
            seduction scenes of Baby Doll by the cunning Vacarro - in a rusty,
          old wheel-less Pierce-Arrow limousine, on a decrepit double-swing on
          the property, and upstairs in Archie's dilapidated mansion, including
          a childhood game of hide-and-seek with a barely-clothed Baby Doll that
          extended into the unsafe attic area. He compelled her to sign an incriminating
          statement attesting to the fact that her husband set fire to the gin
          and that Archie had lied about his alibi. During a subsequent supper
          scene, Vacarro further seduced Baby Doll in
          a sneaky and steamy kissing scene behind a wall almost within view
          of Archie. The film ended with Vacarro confronting
          Archie with Baby Doll's signed affidavit. Vacarro further enraged Archie
          by admitting that he had coaxed other favors from Baby Doll. Archie
          responded by retrieving his shotgun and chasing Vacarro outside while
          Baby Doll called the police.  Archie was promptly arrested
          by the authorities after  Vacarro presented the signed affidavit
          for the crime of arson - at around midnight when Baby Doll turned 20. </font></p>          </td>

              D: Nicholas Ray<br />
              This insightful Nicholas Ray-directed film - an Eisenhower-Era,
              20th Century Fox, CinemaScope melodrama, told about the disintegration
              of a nuclear family; it also functioned as a superb critique of
              the suffocating and claustrophobic conformity of 50s middle-class
              life (a film pre-dating <i><a href="amerb.html">American Beauty
              (1999)</a></i> by over 40 years!), and it served as an profound examination of prescription
          drug abuse. Underpaid and frustrated schoolteacher
          and devoted, suburban middle-class father Ed Avery (James Mason) 
          was secretly moonlighting as a cab dispatcher a few afternoons a week
          to support his family, wife Lou (Barbara Rush) and one son Richie (Christopher
          Olsen), as a solid masculine provider to pay the bills. He had been
          experiencing memory lapses and more painful symptoms, but had kept
          his physical ailments to himself. Suddenly he blacked out and collapsed
          in the bedroom and was rushed to the hospital. He was diagnosed with
          a severe and rare illness (<i>periarteritis nodosa</i> - a destructive
          inflammation of the arteries due to a deadly blood disease) that might
          end his life within a year. To treat his condition, Ed was prescribed
          and treated with an experimental 'miracle drug' or hormone (<i>cortisone</i>).
          Immediately after his hospital release, there were two scenes of Ed's
          manic, wild, and reckless consumer spending spree - a sign of his medical
          deterioration and developing megalomania and tyrannical nature: (1)
          he unnecessarily bought an expensive dress for his wife, and (2)
           purchased a fancy bicycle with &quot;three gears, hand brakes&quot; at a pricey bike shop for Richie. He
 began to scare and concern his family with his 'keyed-up' activity, and unpredictable
and dictatorial nature. A cracked medicine cabinet mirror metaphorically expressed
how his tormented personality was beginning to fracture. Ed was beginning to
go through increasingly-wild personality changes and fractured mood
              swings (with manic highs and depressive lows) due to  his unauthorized
overdosing on  his expensive prescription drug (costing $2 dollars a day). Although
he was having intense personal problems, Ed denied having any long-term effects
such as mental problems or bouts of depression. Family friend and gym teacher
Wally Gibbs (Walter Matthau) expressed his concerns to Lou about Ed's strange
              behavior and possible mental issues: &quot;He just isn't the same
        guy. You know, uh, big shot. He even looks bigger.&quot; Ed began to
        denigrate his family life - calling it &quot;petty domesticity.&quot; He planned
        to leave the household and begin some unknown life venture elsewhere,
        and also declared to Lou that she was intellectually inferior to him.
        He even impersonated his physician and forged a new prescription in order
        to acquire more cortisone (due to his constant overdosing).   The increasingly
        pushy, fragmented and opinionated Ed constantly belittled and  
        tyrannized Richie with verbal abuse - during a game of football catch,
        and during home-schooling in a mathematics lesson. During a late night
        dinner at their long family table (borrowed from <a href="amerb.html"><i>American
        Beauty (1999)</i></a>), Ed declared that their marriage was basically over, although he would
        remain solely for Richie's sake. Ed's worried son Richie was caught
        when searching for his father's hidden medicine bottle. He
        locked himself in the bathroom and struggled to call the family
        physician to help end his father's prescription. To belittle and punish
        his son Richie for being disobedient, Ed read from a Bible (following
        the text with scissors in his hand) and became determined to emulate
        Abraham's sacrifice of his son Isaac in the Old Testament by murdering
        his son. He was only restrained
        from killing Richie upstairs with a pair of scissors (and urging
        the family's complete suicide) by the saving actions of Wally Gibbs,
        who rushed into the house and scuffled one-on-one with Ed. He was  returned
        to the hospital for sedation. Dr. Norton (Robert F. Simon) realized that
        the only treatment that might work to help Ed recover and be cured of
        his deep psychosis would be to have him recall everything that happened,
        including threats to kill Richie. The film ended with Lou and Richie
        around his hospital bed when Ed came out of sedation and seemed to have
        been relieved of his psychosis. He hugged his 
        family members and asked for them to be &quot;closer&quot; to him -
        a happy ending? </font></p></td>

        Director Jean-Pierre Melville's gangster-caper/heist crime drama  was
        a great character study with post-noirish characteristics and themes
        similar to many other American caper films. Some claimed

        monochromatic shading and natural lighting). The film's opening  for
        the &quot;strange tale&quot; was in the year 1955 in the Montmartre district
        of Paris, France. The title character was an unlucky, almost-broke, high-rolling,
        genteel, slick-backed white-haired, fedora-wearing, aging gangster named
        Bob Montagn&eacute;  (Roger Duchesne) - known popularly as   compulsive
        'Bob the Gambler.' His usual daily routine was to
        sleep during the day and gamble at night until 6 am. One of his unlikely
        friends was local police inspector Commissioner Lieut. Ledru (Guy Decomble),
        who knew that Bob was an ex-con who had served time 20 years earlier for the Rimbaud
        Bank robbery, but had now aged and &quot;quieted...down.&quot; Bob's other
        friends included his handsome young punk protege Paolo (Daniel
        Cauchy) - a wannabe gangster, and the  corner-bar-restaurant
        manager/owner Yvonne (Simone Paris). He had developed a marked distaste
        for  &quot;no-good,&quot; un-reformed, ex-con pimp Marc (Gerard Buhr),
        who was trying to entice young,
       coquettish and flirtatious streetwalker-nymphet Anne (Isabelle
        Corey) to become one of his sex clients. Marc was hauled into Lieut.
        Ledru's office and threatened with being charged and arrested for a beating
        and pimping-procurement, but was freed when he promised to become a police
        informer. Bob decided to befriend and platonically protect Anne by inviting
        her to stay with him in his swanky Montmartre penthouse apartment. Meanwhile,
        Paolo became entranced with Anne and had sex with her. During a visit
        to the Deauville Casino with his professional safecracker-expert friend
        Roger (Andr&eacute; Garet), they met up with another ex-con gang member
        named Jean de Lisieu (Claude Cerval), who worked there as a casino-croupier.
        Once Roger explained what Jean had told him about the casino's usual
        big haul during the Grand Prix at 5:00 am of 800 million francs in the
        safe, Bob decided to attempt one last score - an audacious plan to rob
        the casino. Bob and Roger received inside help from Jean, who provided detailed
        floor-plans of the casino's layout and the number and make of the
        safe. The plan to rob the casino started to go awry when
        Jean's avaricious new wife Suzanne (Colette Fleury) became suspicious,
        and Paolo foolishly bragged about the idea to Anne, who then went on
        to divulge the plan to Marc. There was considerable suspense regarding
        whether Marc or Suzanne would be able to reveal the heist's plan to Lieut.
        Ledru. After Paolo was reprimanded by
        Roger and Bob for being a &quot;jerk&quot; and &quot;squawking...in
        the sack&quot; to Anne (who then shared the information with Marc), Paolo
        jealously sought out Marc (who had just dialed Lieut.
        Ledru on a pay phone) and lethally shot him in the back before
        he divulged anything. In the film's ironic and anti-climactic conclusion,
              before the safecracking attempt by the gang at 5:00 am, Bob
              couldn't resist entering the Deauville Casino as a customer at
              1:30 am to non-chalantly bet at roulette and a card-game known
              as <i>chemin de fer</i>; remarkably, Bob's tremendous winning streak
        netted him millions of francs. While Bob was cashing  in his chips inside
               the casino at about 5:00 am, the police converged outside and
              confronted Bob's team of criminals. A brief shoot-out left Paolo
        dead before the heist even took place. Both Bob and Roger were arrested
        by Commissioner Ledru as Bob's winning piles of cash were loaded into
              the back of the squad car. Inside the car,  Ledru, Bob, and Roger
              briefly discussed what Bob's fate might be (as the plan's
              mastermind, he hadn't robbed the casino or actually committed any
              crime). Bob even joked in the film's final line that he might even
              be able to sue the police for damages: &quot;And with a really
              top lawyer, I might sue for damages.&quot; </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Burmese Harp (1956, Jp.) (aka Biruma
                No Tategoto)</strong>, 116 minutes, D: Kon Ichikawa<br />
                Director Kon Ichikawa's haunting black and white anti-war drama
        with musical elements was a fable-like story - a meditation upon evil,
                the devastating aftermath and horrors of the chaos of war, the
                mystery of why mortals suffer, and spiritual awakening. The narrator
                described it as &quot;a story we shall never
        forget.&quot; At the close of the Pacific theatre of WWII in July
              of 1945, a group of weary Japanese soldiers led by Captain Inouye
        (Rentar&#333; Mikuni), after years
              of war and fighting in Burma, were  retreating and planning
        to  return to Japan.  As they marched through the jungle, they sang 
        nostalgic homeland songs with music provided by self-taught, Burmese
        harp-playing Private First Class Mizushima Yasuhiko (Shoji Yasui), the
        regiment's scout, who played his hand-crafted Burmese harp. In a peasant
        village, they were surrounded and peacefully captured by a contingent
        of British and Indian forces and taken as POWs, while learning that their
        nation had surrendered three days earlier and the war was officially
        over.  Mizushima volunteered to the British forces to talk to another
        resistant and besieged group of Japanese soldiers who refused to quit
        fighting up in Triangle Mountain, a half a day's trek away. He failed
        in his mission to persuade them to surrender - ending with the British
        destruction of the cave where the hold-outs were encamped and the death
        of the entire squadron. The wounded Mizushima regained consciousness
        and emerged from the pile of bodies in the cave - he was the sole
        survivor. Meanwhile, the captured Japanese regiment led by Captain Inouye
              were marched to a  British prison work
        camp in Mudon about 200 miles to the south - fearing that Mizushima had
        been killed. However, Mizushima had been   
            rescued and cared for by a Buddhist monk. In order to rejoin his
            fellow soldiers without being identified as a soldier, he took
            the monk's monastic robes and shaved his head. Barefooted and soon
            starving, he began an itinerant journey through the countryside to
        be reunited with his regiment in Mudon. Mizushima experienced a spiritual
        transformation after he saw many unburied and abandoned corpses of hundreds
        of Japanese war casualties on a hillside and shoreline, with vultures
        lurking nearby. He decided to honor the dead by saluting and
        burying some of them in mass burial mounds or graves. He continued on
        to Mudon to a Buddhist temple near the POW camp to become a reclusive
        monk in hiding, while often returning to bury the corpses. He dedicated
        and devoted himself to finishing the task of burying all of the left-behind
        corpses of fallen Japanese soldiers.  The Captain's men were inspired
        to continue searching to find their fellow comrade. They soon doubted
        the news of his brave death at Triangle Mountain after various sightings
        and other suspicious instances suggesting that Mizushima was still alive.
        Within days of being shipped to Japan, the regiment communicated with
        Mizushima at the Buddhist temple through a talking parrot (trained to
        speak: &quot;Hey, Mizushima! Let's return to Japan together&quot;). He responded by sending
        back his own parrot who replied: &quot;No, I can't go back,&quot; and
        in addition wrote a lengthy letter about his motivations to remain in
        Burma. The film concluded with Captain Inouye reading the heartfelt letter
        outloud to his men on the deck of their Japan-bound ship. it explained
        why Mizushima couldn't return to his beloved homeland of Japan - he had
        become dedicated to the priesthood, to adopt the Buddhist lifestyle and
        live a peaceful life. He would remain to continue burying the bodies
        and one day, might be able to return to his war-ravaged country if possible,
        but probably not (&quot;My life may end here&quot;). The film's final
        image was of Mizushima wandering and walking alone on the landscape of
        a Burmese plain, and the words from the film's opening: &quot;The soil
        of Burma is red, and so are its rocks.&quot; </font></p></td>

            Aka <em>The Wrong Kind of Girl</em>, this comedy/drama, adapted by
            George Axelrod (who also co-wrote <a href="seve.html"><em>The Seven
            Year Itch (1955)</em></a> that also starred Monroe) and based on
            the hit Broadway play by William Inge, was Marilyn Monroe's first &quot;serious&quot; lead
            role. It has been widely considered the best role of her career,
            mixing comedy with dark pathos, and clearly proved that she was a
            more-than-capable actress reflecting her skillful acting talent and
            some of her own personal insecurities. Cherie (Marilyn Monroe), a
            fifth-rate, dim-witted, wanna-be saloon singer (or chanteuse) was
            performing in Phoenix, AZ at the run-down, hillbilly saloon-bar -
            the Blue Dragon Cafe. She was originally from the Ozarks in Arkansas,
            with dreams of eventually going to Hollywood (&quot;Look where I'm
            goin'...Hollywood and Vine&quot;). The most memorable moment of <em>Bus
            Stop </em>
			was Cherie's famous off-key,
            inept, but torch-song performance of &quot;That
          Old Black Magic&quot; for an unappreciative audience, mixing sensuousness
          with a wistfully sad, soulful quality. Her life's
          path crossed that of  naive,  virginal 21 year-old callow
          and rude cowboy Beauregard 'Bo' Decker (Don Murray in his film debut)
          from Montana - in town for a rodeo competition. He was immediately
          smitten by his sweet 'angel.' The country bumpkin persistently tried
          to woo Cherie (whom he crudely called Cherry), and almost immediately
          imagined or assumed that they were engaged after kissing her, and that
          they would be married at the rodeo the next day after the purchase
          of a marriage license. She immediately rejected him: &quot;I have no
          intention in the world of marryin' you.&quot; When the rodeo ended
          (and Bo had been awarded $4,000 for winning almost every event), he
          announced that he had bought tickets back to Montana - including one
          for Cherie. When she resisted again, Bo literally roped her and dragged
          her onto his bus to Helena, Montana - he forcefully kidnapped her to
          take her home with him. In the film's conclusion, the bus became stranded
          due to a blizzard-snowstorm, and the passengers had to seek shelter
          inside a familiar roadside bus stop known as Grace's Diner. When Bo
          finally realized that he had overstepped his bounds, he humbly asked
                for Cherie's forgiveness: &quot;Cherry, it wasn't right of me
                to do what I did to you, treatin' you that way, draggin' you
                on the bus, and tryin' to make you marry me whether you wanted
                to or not. Do you think you can ever forgive me?&quot; Cherie
                began to realize that Bo was a man who could show her respect
                when he again professed his sincere love to her. Bo  bolstered
                up his courage (&quot;guts&quot;) and gently asked her to resume
                their relationship. She breathlessly responded: &quot;I'd
                go anywhere in the world with you now. Anywhere at all!&quot; -
                they happily hugged and spun around - deciding to get married
                and live on his Montana ranch. Bo was overjoyed: &quot;She's
                gonna marry me!&quot;, and Cherie was ecstatic also: &quot;Ain't
                it wonderful when somebody so terrible turns out to be so nice?&quot; The
          film ended with the couple boarding the bus to Montana.</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Carousel (1956)</b>, 128 minutes, D: Henry King</font><br />
          <font size="2"> This downbeat, serious, semi-bleak and haunting yet
              ambitious Henry King-directed 20th Century Fox film, made in Cinemascope
              55, was a dramatic, romantic-fantasy musical with a flawed, misogynistic
              central character in a doomed and troubled marriage. It included
        themes of unspoken love and feelings, and a meditation on death.  It
              was the filmic adaptation of a Rodgers/Hammerstein stage musical
               that opened on Broadway in 1945. The 'Heaven Can Wait' plot opened
              with a pre-credits sequence, set in the year 1888. Already-deceased
              Billy Bigelow (Gordon MacRae) was working in a heavenly-setting
              (outside the pearly gates to Heaven?) polishing glass stars for
              the Starkeeper (Gene Lockhart). He had already been dead for 15
        years. Billy began to describe his previous life in 1870s New England
          and the small town of Boothbay Harbor, Maine, hoping to receive permission
          to return for a single day to Earth. The film consisted of Billy's
          flashback - a dramatized story of his life, in order to convince
              the Starkeeper to allow him one day back on Earth. He wanted to
              deal with the rumored problems occurring there and rectify or make
              amends for the mistakes he had made. The handsome, macho, fast-talking
              Billy described how he was hired by tough, shrewish, streetwise
              carousel owner Mrs. Mullin (Audrey Christie) to be a barker at
              her Mullin's Carousel. Billy came to the
              attention of lovely, innocent-minded and decent Julie Jordan (Shirley
        Jones), accompanied by her best friend Carrie Pipperidge (Barbara Ruick),
              and stood next to Julie as she took a carousel ride, causing
              jealousy with Mrs. Mullin. When
              the amorous bad-boy Billy refused to comply and obey Mrs. Mullin
              (who ordered that Julie must never ride the carousel again), he
              was promptly discharged from his job. An increasing romantic interest
              between Julie and Billy grew when they met down the road
        by the water later that evening, and discussed their feelings about each
              other, and agreed they were incompatible with each other.
              Millworker Julie purposely decided to stay behind with Billy, beyond
              her curfew, knowing that she would definitely lose her mill job.
              They sang a beautiful and melodious duet titled: &quot;If I Loved
              You&quot; about
              the possibilities of marrying each other. The two kissed twice
              and walked off hand-in-hand, and in the next scene returned to
              town as a married couple. Due to their financial difficulties,
              they were forced to live with Julie's Cousin Nettie Fowler (Claramae
              Turner) at her seaside spa. Billy began to feel embarrassed and
              humiliated about being idle and unemployed and unable to provide
              for Julie. The unhappy and bitter Billy was rumored to have hit
              Julie once (off-screen), but she defended him in regards to the
              abusive wife-beating charges. Shortly later, Julie announced to
              Billy that she was pregnant. Unwisely, he became a deckhand for
              jailbird sailor Jigger Craigin (Cameron Mitchell), who unfortunately
              tempted him down a criminal path toward bad behavior, laziness,
              drinking and card-game gambling. During a clambake and treasure
              hunt of all the townsfolk on a nearby island, Billy and Jigger
              snuck back to town to rob one of the rich ship-owners on the dock,
              mill-owner boss Mr. Bascombe (John Dehner). He resisted with a
              gun, and during the botched robbery and altercation, Billy fled
              but fell from a collapsing pile of crates onto his own knife and
              was lethally wounded in the abdomen. He died in the arms of his
              soon-to-be widowed and pregnant wife Julie. Cousin Nettie consoled
        the heartbroken Julie with &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone.&quot; Fifteen
        years later when the flashback ended, Billy was back in the heavenly,
        other-worldly setting.  The Starkeeper suggested
              that Billy could help his troubled 15 year-old teenaged daughter
              Louise Bigelow (Susan Luckey) who had been
              traumatized with the knowledge that her deceased father was a thief.
         Billy was allowed entrance to Earth (accompanied by his Heavenly Friend
        (William LeMassena)), and grabbed a star to take with him. Without identifying
        himself, Billy became visible to Louise and attempted to console her
        and make amends when she complained about contiinual mistreatment and
        vilification. He attempted
              to present her with the gift of a heavenly star, but when she refused,
        he again acted abusively and slapped her hand. Louise rushed inside her
        home to tell Julie - not that she was slapped, but that it hadn't hurt
        and she had felt a kiss. Julie suspected that Billy had returned. The
        last scene took place at Louise's graduation ceremony, attended by an
        invisible Billy and his Heavenly Friend. The town's
        beloved doctor Dr. Selden (Gene Lockhart, in a dual role) delivered an
        inspiring and hopeful speech about not being held back by one's
        parents' failures. Twice during the speech, Billy directed encouraging
        thoughts to Louise: &quot;Believe him, darling. Believe!&quot; He also
        vowed his  true love to Julie: (&quot;I loved you, Julie. Know that I
        loved you&quot;).
          A view of the setting sun appeared behind the redeemed Billy as he
        departed to enter into Heaven.</font></p></td>

              This influential, classic science-fiction space adventure - the
              first science-fiction film in color and CinemaScope - and an adaptation
              of Shakespeare's <i>The Tempest</i> - was a forerunner of the entire <i>Star
              Trek</i> (and <i>Lost in Space</i>) franchises. The story, set
              in the 23rd century, told of a journey by astronauts, led by Commander
              Adams (Leslie Nielsen), on a flying saucer-shaped United Planets
              space cruiser C-57D to a distant planet-star named Altair-IV with
              green skies, to investigate the fate of a colony (the <i>Bellerophon</i> expedition)
              planted about 20 years earlier. Upon their landing  
              in a desert  area, the crew's space-ship was met by a fast-moving
              Jeep-like vehicle driven by a large bi-pedal robot, about 7 and
              a half feet tall. It was the film's real
              star - friendly Robby the Robot (voice by Marvin Miller) (who
              influenced and was the progenitor of many other future robotic
              creations).  Two of Adams' fellow officers
            (Lt. &quot;Doc&quot; Ostrow (Warren Stevens) and Lt. Farman (Jack
            Kelly)) were transported (and escorted) to the home of the sole surviving
            <i>Bellerophon</i> expedition crew member, reclusive philologist
            Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) - chauffeured by Robby, who served as
            both a house servant and guard, and provided comic relief: (&quot;Sorry
            miss, I was giving myself an oil job!&quot;). Adams and the other
            officers were astounded by news about the fate
            of the other <i>Bellerophon</i> research expedition members who were
            violently killed in their first year by some dark, ambiguous, unknown
            and mysterious &quot;planetary
            force,&quot; acc. to Morbius. The crew was introduced
            to Morbius' lovely, doe-eyed and very naive, barefoot and Eve-like
            19 year-old daughter Altaira (Anne Francis) who had never seen men. She
            marveled: (&quot;I've always so terribly
            wanted to meet a young man, and now three of them at once&quot;),
            A few days later, Adams and &quot;Doc&quot; visited a second time and Adams
            found Altaira swimming nude in a pool, and innocently asking &quot;What's
          a bathing suit?&quot; Dr. Morbius decided to give Adams and &quot;Doc&quot; a
          tour of &quot;Krell Wonders&quot; - in length, he described
          the civilization from the past; it was an advanced
          technological and sophisticated civilization from 2,000 centuries earlier,
          inhabited by a mighty race of beings who called themselves the Krells.
          But for some reason, the superior alien race of geniuses had destroyed
          itself or become extinct. Morbius toured &quot;Krell
          Wonders&quot; as he  led them through
          a huge network of underground rooms, deep shafts (composed of &quot;78
          hundred levels&quot;), and cranium head-set devices, and  how he
          had greatly increased his own mental prowess and psychic powers through
          the Krell's I.Q. machine. The Krells had been the subject of Morbius'
          research for the past 20 years. A few of the
          film's scarier sequences were the three night-time scenes of the lethal
          attacks on the crew of the flying saucer, revealed eventually to be
          a sinister, invisible Id monster - a living, giant biped monster with
          sloth-like claws that was repelled at the perimeter of a force field
          fence around the spaceship. Once Commander Adams learned  
          that Morbius - in a dream state - was creating the invisible creature
          in his own sleeping mind, he confronted Morbius
            and demanded that he explain the Id (&quot;What
            is the ID?&quot;). At first, Morbius called the Id an outdated
            and obsolete term, but then offered names for the invisible Id monster:
            (&quot;The beast. The mindless primitive! Even the Krell must have
            evolved from that beginning&quot;). It  became clear that
            the Krell from 2,000 centuries earlier didn't realize the power
            that was destroying them from within (their inner subconscious
            thoughts), and Morbius was reluctant to face the conclusion that
            he himself was a &quot;living monster.&quot; Finally with a startling
            confession, Morbius admitted that the Id was his own projected
            or externalized sub-conscious. He explained that he was the source
            of the monstrous creature, after the Krell had built a machine
            able to release his inner beast. Morbius was forced to realize
            that he was unable to control his subconscious desires. In the
            concluding sequence, Morbius delivered instructions to Adams to explosively
            destroy the 'forbidden planet' of Altair-IV (after triggering the
            machine's self-destruct mechanism that would detonate in 24 hours)
            to prevent its terrible Krell technology from ever being used again.
            As the crew flew off (with Altaira who had been saved, along with
            Robby), they watched the planet's destruction from afar in space. </font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Friendly Persuasion (1956)</b>, 137 minutes, D:
          William Wyler<br />
        UA's and director Wyler's nostalgic, western 'family' drama was based
        on Jessamyn West's 1945 novel <i>The Friendly Persuasion</i> (a series
        of vignettes or short stories) about a pacifist Quaker family, the Birdwells,
        living in southern Indiana in the town of Vernon (Jennings County) during
        the Civil War (in 1862). It was Wyler's first color film for a commercial
        studio. The script was written by uncredited and blacklisted writer Michael
        Wilson. It won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and was
        the recipient of six Academy Awards nominations (with no wins), including
          Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (for Anthony
          Perkins appearing in his second film). The family
          was composed of patriarchal father and nurseryman Jess Birdwell (Gary
          Cooper) and his devout Quaker minister wife Eliza (Dorothy McGuire)
          of a local fellowship, who insured that the family was stringently
          pacifist. The pious sect members spoke with antique pronouns for the
          second person singular (i.e., <i>thou</i> and <i>thee</i>) - judged
          as sounding &quot;mighty queer.&quot;  Temptations often
          arose for the inner religious convictions of the Birdwells who were
          continually challenged and tested by &quot;worldly&quot; things, such
          as gambling, the county-fair, dancing, swearing, violence,
          horseracing (one of Jess' sinful loves), and even music. The
          loving couple had three children: sensitive eldest teenaged son Joshua
          or &quot;Josh&quot; (Anthony Perkins), daughter Martha True &quot;Mattie&quot; (Phyllis
          Love) (who fell in love with non-Quaker neighbor son Gardner or &quot;Gard&quot; Jordan
          (Mark Richman) who served as a lieutenant in the Union cavalry), and
          younger brother &quot;Little&quot; Jess (Richard Eyer) (who was in
          a never ending battle with pet goose Samantha). The Birdwells employed
          a farmhand Enoch (Joel Fluellen), a runaway slave. Meanwhile, there
          were reports of increasing threats to the peaceful lives of the Birdwells
          by Morgan's Raiders - 1,500 rebel Confederate guerrillas and cavalry,
          who had now crossed the Ohio River and were conducting raids into S.
          Indiana, to burn barns and loot houses. They were currently only 30
          miles from Vernon and would arrive soon. Troubled
            son Josh - who was conflicted by his religious beliefs, was worried
            about the approach of the Raiders. He was concerned when his mother
            reacted passively: 'If it's the Lord's will, there's nothing we can
             do.&quot; To his parents' surprise, Josh announced his reluctant,
             sudden decision to join Gard and the Home Guard, and that he would
          be leaving from Vernon the next morning. Various incidents brought
          to light the violence and horrors of war: during the fighting by the
          nearby river, Josh witnessed the death of one of his comrades and fired
          back at the Confederates, as tears streamed down his face. During Jess'
          absence to find his feared-dead son, a group of Confederates arrived
          to pillage the Birdwell farm. The  openly-hospitable Eliza defused
          the situation by greeting and welcoming the enemy soldiers, allowing
           them to take all the meat, chickens and supplies they wanted, and
          feeding them in her kitchen. At the river while looking for Josh,
            Jess found his Methodist neighbor Sam Jordan (Robert Middleton) dying
          (with a stomach bullet wound after a &quot;reb
            bushwhacker&quot; tried to steal his horse) and they talked about
            their ritualistic horse-racing rivalry before he passed away. Jess
          was also ambushed by the lone Confederate &quot;Rebel&quot; bushwhacker
          (Richard Garland) and appeared to be hit, but was only slightly grazed
          on the forehead. He fell and pretended to be dead and then - although
          he had the opportunity to kill the soldier, he only disarmed him and
          then freed him unhurt. Jess located his heart-sick,
            wounded (in the arm) but surviving son Josh lying on the ground amongst
              other bodies, and reaching out to the corpse near to him. He was
              distraught over having killed the young Confederate soldier. As
              the film was concluding, Jess brought his son back home on his
          horse. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: George Stevens<br />
            The sprawling, grandiose and iconic western epic and
            drama was based on the celebrated Edna Ferber novel. It told about
            two generations of a wealthy American cattle ranching family spanning
            a twenty-five year period, who clashed over money, property, class
            differences, and racism in Texas (the film was mostly shot on location
            in Marfa, TX). The film received only one Oscar out of its 10 Academy
            Award nominations (including Best Picture, two Best Actor nominations
            (for Rock Hudson and James Dean), Best Supporting Actress (McCambridge),
             Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Color Art Direction/Set Decoration,
            Best Color Costume Design, Best Film Editing, and Best Music Score
          (Dimitri Tiomkin)) - Stevens won the Best Director Oscar. It
          was particularly poignant as the last (and 2nd posthumous Oscar-nominated)
          performance of James Dean's tragically short career. In
              the film's opening set in the 1920s, newly-wed Maryland socialite
              belle Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), arrived with her new,
            wealthy Texas rancher-husband Jordan 'Bick' Benedict, Jr. (Rock Hudson)
            at his sprawling Benedict Texas ranch (known as &quot;Reata&quot;).
            He had become acquainted with her on a trip to Maryland to purchase
            a spirited stallion named War Winds from her father  - and they were
            quickly married and honeymooning while on their way back to Texas.
            There, they met his older, tough, cattle-driving spinster-sister
            Luz Benedict (Mercedes McCambridge), who managed the ranch, and uneducated,
            laconic Texas ranch-hand cowboy Jett Rink (James Dean), who was seen
            in an iconic pose - sitting in the back of a black convertible with
            his feet up during an outdoor BBQ. After
            Luz's tragic death when she was thrown from Leslie's horse War
            Winds, as a dying sentiment, Luz had bequested a little piece of
            land (part of Reata) to resentful, lowly ranch hand Jett. Bick offered
            to acquire the willed Reata land from Jett for twice its true value,
            to keep it in the Benedict family, but Jett declined the offer. He
            visited his property where he climbed the tower of a wooden windmill
            to survey his property - he sat and looked out at his new possession
            - as Dimitri Tiomkin's magnificent score boomed. The pushy, stubborn-headed
            Bick insisted on the manly tradition of governing his property and
            its people, with errant ideas about child-rearing, and he often disputed
              with Leslie over the future careers of the Benedict children. The
              couple spoke about the distance and frictions growing between them
              (due to Bick's insensitivity to her efforts at social reform and
              his insensitive, misogynistic tendencies, especially toward his
            non-manly son Jordy (Dennis Hopper as adult)). Meanwhile, Jett
            Rink had become a <i>nouveau-riche</i> tycoon millionaire when
            he struck oil on his own small piece of land (Little Reata). Covered
            with the gushing liquid black gold (crude oil), he made boastful,
            defiant and resentful statements to the Benedict family at Reata
            about how he would be richer than them, and made an inappropriate
            pass toward Leslie (the object of his unrequited love) - this established
            the origins of a long-standing fierce rivalry. Over the years, Rink
            aged from a young man to a mumbling outcast and dissolute drunkard
            (known as &quot;Mr. Texas&quot;).  He spitefully dated the
            rebellious Benedict daughter Luz Benedict II (24 year-old Carroll
            Baker). Bick had become distraught that his children had all abandoned
            his plans to take over Reata, and reluctantly agreed with Jett in
            the 1940s to allow oil production
            and oil-well drilling on his land to help the war effort. Cattle-ranching
            and oil drilling were seen to co-exist, and   the oil-rich Bick was
            now a Texas oil baron as well as cattle rancher. Rink's
            downfall came during a celebratory scene to commemorate the opening
            of his new airport and hotel in Hermosa, Texas, with the entire Benedict
            clan in attendance. With racial tensions increasing, both Jordy and
            Bick entered into separate quarrels with Jett and challenged him
             to a fight. Bick realized that Jett was drunkenly incoherent and
            incapable of defending himself: (&quot;You&rsquo;re
            ain't even worth hittin'. Jett, you wanna know somethin' true?
            You&rsquo;re all through&quot;). Jett became so drunk that he
            was unable to deliver his prepared speech - he fell forward and
            passed out on top of the table, and the room was cleared and everyone
            prepared to return home. Later in the empty banquet room, 
			the lonely, self-destructive, self-pitying
              and pathetic Rink drunkenly mumbled, sobbed, and rambled to an
              imaginary audience. The tragically-defeated figure
              began to speak about his unrequited, covetous love - not for Luz,
              but for Leslie, and ultimately collapsed. The next day, Bick drove
            Leslie, Luz, and Jordy's Hispanic wife Juana Villalobos (Elsa
            C&aacute;rdenas)  (and her baby Little Jordy IV)
            toward home. They stopped at a roadside cafe-diner known as Sarge's
            Place, owned by bigoted cafe owner Sarge (Mickey Simpson). Although
            Sarge made an exception to serve the racially-mixed, but well-to-do
            family of Benedicts, he indignantly refused
              to serve another elderly Latino couple while &quot;The Yellow Rose
              of Texas&quot; blared on the jukebox. The proud member of the ruling
              elite Bick confronted Sarge and the two commenced a brawling, bruising
              fist-fight. The often-racist, close-minded rancher Bick had
              finally proven to his equally-stubborn feminist wife, a champion
              for the rights of the downtrodden Mexicans, that he had evolved
              in his thinking and hadn't failed in life, although he actually
              lost the physical fight. Back at Reata, Leslie
                considered their own family legacy a success, and how she was
                newly proud and respectful of Bick's enlightened understanding
                of racial differences - they now had two multi-racial grandsons
            (one Caucasian and one Hispanic). </font></p>          </td>

              D: Charles Walters<br />
              This entertaining, light-hearted Technicolored, VistaVision MGM
        musical comedy with an original Cole Porter score was a  tuneful remake
              of director George Cukor's screwball comedy <i><a href="phil.html">The
              Philadelphia Story (1940). </a></i> The original non-musical film
              set in Philadelphia starred Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and
        James Stewart. Both films were based
        on Philip Barry's 1939 play <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>. The romantic
        musical comedy, now set amongst the rich elite of Newport, RI, starred
        miscast Bing Crosby as ex-husband CK Dexter Haven, Frank Sinatra as tabloid
        writer Mike Connor, and Grace Kelly (in her last film before marrying
        Prince Rainier of Monaco), as rich girl Tracy Samantha Lord.  In the
        film's plot covering about a day and a half, musician Louis Armstrong
        (as Himself) and his band were delivered to a palatial estate home where
        they were greeted by successful jazz singer-composer C.K. Dexter-Haven
        (Bing Crosby), a financially-successful and popular composer-singer who
        was organizing the upcoming Newport Jazz Festival. He was living in a
        mansion where rehearsals would be held in the lobby, and it happened
        to be located across the street from where his ex-wife Tracy Lord (Grace
        Kelly) lived. Dexter had been divorced
              from wealthy, strong-minded Newport, Rhode Island socialite Tracy
        Samantha (&quot;Sam&quot;) Lord (Grace Kelly), but was still in love
        with her. Dexter retained his love for bride-to-be Tracy (&quot;I'm still
        in love with you&quot;) and was maneuvering to win Tracy back. Tracy
        was in the midst of preparations in the Lord's estate for her impending
        marriage the next day to a stuffy and bland gentleman named George Kittredge
        (John Lund). Two employees of the tabloid magazine <i>Spy</i> arrived
        to  stay at the Lord's residence to cover the high-society wedding: reporter
        Mike Connor (Frank Sinatra) and photographer Elizabeth
              &quot;Liz&quot; Imbrie (Celeste Holm). Tracy's Uncle Willie (Louis
              Calhern) had been promised by a SPY editor (Paul Keast) - or blackmailed
              - that a scandalous,
              &quot;unsavory&quot; article about Mr. Seth Lord's (Sidney Blackmer)
              infidelity with a dancer would be withheld and not published if
              they were given permission to attend. Tracy sternly ordered no
              interference from Dexter to ruin her wedding, but he still brought
              her a wedding present. By the pool, Dexter met with Tracy (in her
              bathing suit), and mused about the reason for their failed marriage.
              After he left, she opened the gift - a scale model of their former
              sailboat-yacht &quot;<i>True Love</i>.&quot;  Tracy was inspired
              - in an evoked flashback sequence or reverie, to recall her romantic
              honeymoon with Dexter aboard their yacht. She remembered Dexter
              on shipboard singing to her (with a squeezebox) the romantic popular
        Oscar-nominated hit song &quot;True Love.&quot; Tracy was beginning to
        have second-thoughts  
        about marrying Kittredge who unrealistically idealized her as a &quot;goddess.&quot;
        Mike was also expressing his increasing affection for 26 year-old Tracy,
        and seductively sang &quot;You're Sensational&quot; to her (&quot;I don't
        care if you are called The fair Miss Frigidaire 'Cause you're sensational&quot;).
        Complications arose the night before the planned wedding as a messy love
        triangle (of sorts) was developing around Tracy, while she experienced
        a series of flirtatious escapades with three men. She was faced with
        a difficult choice between her pompous but clueless fiancee, her reassessment
        of Dexter, and her growing romantic attraction to Mike. Mike also sensed
        Dexter's ongoing love for Tracy, and in a clever duet, Mike and Dexter
        sang the recycled song: &quot;Well, Did You
        Evah?&quot; The night before the wedding, at a celebratory dance at Uncle
        Willie's place, Tracy slipped away with Mike to return to her home. While
        dancing together by the Lord's pool, she suggested that they go swimming
        in the moonlight (&quot;Tonight I want to do everything&quot;). Mike
        sang the beautiful love song &quot;Mind If I Make Love to You&quot; to
        her as they kissed and embraced, before jumping in the pool. The next
        morning at the Lord's residence, George showed up and both George and
        Dexter witnessed Tracy being carried up to the house by Mike (both were
        slightly drunk, wet and dressed in robes) after their pool experience.
        George was now jealously angry with both Dexter and Mike, and Tracy was
        still hung-over and miserable: &quot;I'm such an unholy mess of a girl&quot;
        - she thought she had compromised her own virtue with Mike. Mike calmed
        George's and Tracy's nerves by admitting that due to her drunkenness,
        he had treated her with the utmost respect the previous evening - and
        her virtue remained intact. However, Tracy successfully  coaxed  George
        into calling off their nuptials, by claiming she was unworthy for him
        and couldn't behave herself. However, the  guests had already arrived
              and an organ began playing the 'Wedding March.' Tracy awkwardly
              informed them of the change in plans and that her fiancee had cancelled
        the wedding. Dexter stepped forward to volunteer as the groom,  to make
        up for the wedding they didn't have earlier. They had eloped two years
        earlier to Maryland to get married, and would now have the opportunity
        for a full ceremony. Tracy accepted Dexter's offer, and her father began
        to escort her down the aisle, as Mike and Liz mentioned how the idea
        of marriage was becoming &quot;contagious&quot; -
        a declaration of their own love for each other. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b><a href="inva.html">Invasion of the Body Snatchers
                  (1956)</a>, </b>80 minutes, D: Don Siegel<br />
                  Director Don Siegel's thrilling, allegorical, intensely paranoid,
                  chilling and disturbing classic science fiction/alien film
                  - a parable about alien possession, was based on <em>Collier's
                  Magazine</em>'s serialized story <em>The Body Snatchers</em> by
                  Jack Finney. It was one of the greatest low-budget 50's films.
                  Its cautionary plot, told in flashback, was often interpreted
                  as a metaphor or as philosophical commentary upon the spread
                  of McCarthyism or Communism in the mid-1950s. The subtle, low-budget
                  film (at about $420,000) was very effective in eliciting horror
                  with slow-building tension, even though there were no monsters
                  (just indestructible plant-like pods), minimal special effects,
                  no violence in the take-over of humans, and no deaths. Its
                  main theme was the alien (read 'Communist') dehumanization
                  and take-over of an entire community by large seed pods (found
                  on
                  a pool table,           in a basement, greenhouse, and automobile
                  trunk) that replicated and replaced human
                  beings. And it told of the heroic struggle of one helpless
                  but determined man of conscience, a small-town doctor to vainly
                  combat and quell the deadly, indestructible threat. In the
                  opening prologue (and closing scene - added bookends), Dr.
                  Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) - seemingly psychotic and insanely
                  mad, expressed paranoic fear and mania about an alien takeover
                  in his idyllic hometown of Santa Mira, California; he shouted
                  to an unbelieving group of nurses, interns, psychiatrists (including
                  Whit Bissel as Dr. Hill), and doctors (including Richard Deacon
                  as Dr. Harvey Bassett) in the emergency room of the city's
                  Emergency Hospital; he warned them about seed pods taking over
                  the planet. In the film's original opening (after the added
                  prologue), Dr. Bennell explained, in a series of flashbacks
                  from a few days earlier about the town's take-over. Miles   began
                  to become paranoid and suspicious when his patients reported
                  that their loved ones, friends, and relatives were not themselves
            but emotionless shells, replicas, or imposters. Bennell was visited
                  by his intelligent ex-girlfriend/ sweetheart-fiancee, now recently
            divorced Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), who also told of relatives
                  who had changed their identities or didn't seem to be themselves.
                  In the parking lot of a restaurant before planning to have
                  dinner together, Miles and Becky spoke to the town's only psychiatrist,
                  Dr. Dan Kauffman (Larry Gates), who dismissed the cases of
                  delusional paranoia as: &quot;a strange neurosis&quot; and &quot;an epidemic
                  mass hysteria.&quot; Miles was interrupted by a phone call from
                  friend Jack Belicec (King Donovan) who reported a strange incident
                  in his home. Miles and Becky were invited over,
                  and shown his eerie discovery of a strange, corpse-like cadaver
                  lying on his pool table - with an unfinished, half-formed,
                  mannequin-like humanoid face. An attempt to take fingerprints
                  failed. Later, the repugnant corpse on the pool table cloned
                  or turned into an identical replica of Jack. Fearing that Becky
                  might also be in danger, Dr. Bennell rushed to her home and
                  entered through a basement window; in the darkness, he discovered
                  a smooth-faced, replica &quot;double&quot; for
                  Becky hidden in a bin, and hurried to awaken her. Then during
                  an outdoor BBQ at Miles' home with friends Jack and his wife
                  Theodora (Carolyn Jones), the group discovered at least three
                  giant seed pods that burst and exploded open like rotten cabbages,
                  with a milky fluid bubbling out. Miles took a pitchfork and
              stabbed at his pod's likeness  in a vampire-like killing.  The
            town was being surreptitiously invaded by strange, alien plant
            forms called 'pods,' that took over or replicated the likenesses,
            personalities and identities of human beings while they slept. As
              exhausted fugitives in town (and among the few unaffected by transplant
              absorption), Miles and Becky ended up cornered in his office where
            they were forced to hide and struggle to stay awake and battle the
            changes that threatened to overtake their bodies. Miles pondered
              - with a thoughtful soliloquy - about how the bodies and souls
              of humans were being taken over by aliens, allowing their humanity
            to slowly &quot;drain away.&quot;  They watched as trucks
              arrived, loaded with freshly harvested seed pods, to be divided
              among friends and relatives in other towns, to spread the invasion
            in other communities. They were confronted by Jack and Dr. Kauffman,
            obviously now transformed into clones who warned Miles and Becky
            that they would be next as they placed seed pods to await them and
            grow duplicates. Dr. Kauffman shockingly explained the alluring benefits
            and advantages to them of symbiosis with two fresh pods. In the gripping
            and frightening finale, Miles and Becky knocked out their captors
            with hypodermics filled with drugs, and fled from the town's 
            pods to try to elude the enemy and get help. They fled from pursuit
            and sought refuge in an old abandoned mine shaft. Miles briefly left
            the faint Becky to discover the source of beautiful
            singing or music that they heard. When he returned, he found that
            she was slumped over and fatigued, and took her in his arms to kiss
            her. But then, he drew away from her unresponsive lips - in a tight
            closeup shot of her face, he looked into the blank, dark, expressionless
            and staring eyes of his fianc&eacute;e,
            realizing with a look of utter fright that she was now one of &quot;them&quot; -
            her body had been invaded, cloned and snatched. She screamed
            to the pod-people searchers as he fled: &quot;He's in here! He's
            in here! Get him! Get him!&quot; Miles fled to a busy
            highway, filled with heavy traffic, as he attempted to flag down
            cars. Crazed with fear, he rushed into the onrushing traffic, nervously
            shouting and crying words of warning to the unheeding cars and unconvinced
        drivers. Miles climbed onto the back of a passing
            truck with the names of California cities on it. He was horrified
            to find it loaded with pods to be distributed and spread throughout
            the nation. He dropped off, jumping back on the highway - feeling
            completely helpless. As a crazed prophet of doom, he looked directly
            into the camera, desperately trying to warn others and the audience:
            &quot;YOU'RE NEXT!&quot; In the  added
            epilogue (bookending the added prologue), Miles was still describing
            his fantastic tale in the city's hospital. The doctors regarded
            him as a lunatic and as &quot;mad
            as a March hare,&quot; but then, a second accident victim was brought
            in from a collision between a truck (filled with pod seeds) and
            a Greyhound bus. The victim had to be dug out from under a peculiar
            pile of &quot;great big seed pods&quot; from the truck coming
            out of Santa Mira. Verifying and confirming Miles' story, the police
              started to take control of the invading aliens by blocking highways,
              and the FBI and law enforcement agencies were notified of the
          emergency.</font></p>          </td>

           83 minutes, D: Stanley Kubrick<br />
           This early and stylish Stanley Kubrick <i>film-noir</i> crime drama
           thriller was a raw story of greed and infidelity. The famed director's
           third film and first major and successful film effort, was a definitive
           heist-caper, although it was highly under-rated when first released. The
           doom-laden, voice-over dialogue was derived from Lionel White's novel <em>Clean
           Break</em>. The film has influenced many heist films, including the
           original <em>Ocean's Eleven (1960)</em> (also remade in 2001). The
           black and white heist film was similar in tone and theme to director
           John Huston's <a href="asph.html"><i>The Asphalt Jungle (1950)</i></a> (also
           starring Sterling Hayden). The film opened with
           a view of a typical day of horse-racing at the Lansdowne racetrack
           in the Bay Area. The main five individuals of the film, members of
          a desperate gang, were plotting a heist that evening at 8 pm in
          an apartment. They were introduced - all were anti-hero misfits
           and lowlifes (in an ensemble cast). The group was led by Johnny Clay
           (Sterling Hayden), a grim, determined, and veteran criminal
                  and ex-convict (just released from prison after serving a five-year
                  sentence for robbery at Alcatraz). Johnny was the mastermind
                  - he had recently reunited with his  girlfriend Fay (Coleen
           Gray) to whom he had promised a future together after the robbery's
           success. The group devised and executed
               a complex, carefully-timed racetrack heist of $2 million - that
               ultimately went terribly wrong. The
             plan was to cause simultaneous, diversionary confusion by shooting
             one of the racehorses in mid-race and instigating a bar fight,
             thereby allowing Johnny to rob the main track offices and seize
          the day's takings. Pathetic wimp and loser George Peatty  (Elisha Cook,
           Jr.), the inside-man, the race-track betting window teller/cashier
           with a nagging wife, became the fatal flaw in the planned heist. He
           was involved in a troubled five-year marriage with cynical, devious,
           complaining, domineering, unfaithful, conniving and covetous <i>femme
           fatale</i> wife Sherry (Marie Windsor), and was easily tricked by her. George hinted
           to Sherry that he might be coming into a lot of money soon (&quot;hundreds
           of thousands of dollars...maybe a half million&quot;). Sherry was
           able to convince George to divulge his money-making scheme to her,
           and then the two-timing wife secretly met up that evening with
           her slick, adulterous gangster boyfriend/lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards,
           the future doctor <em>Ben Casey</em> on a TV series),
           who was also two-timing her, to reveal the details of the heist. Sherry's
           plan with Val was that they would steal the money from George and
           his associates after the robbery at the rendezvous point. Sherry believed
           that the money would bring her out of poverty and revitalize her life.
           The $2 million dollar race-track robbery involved Johnny holding
           up accountants in the track's back counting room (after being let
           in by George), while others assisted in getting the money out of the
           building, and two other crooks created chaos during the race - including
           two diversionary tactics. After the theft, all of the surviving gang
           members were at the rendezvous point in an apartment where they
           planned to split up the money (but Johnny was delayed by traffic).
           Val barged in to steal their loot with an associate named Tiny (Joe
           Turkel). After a wild shootout, seriously-wounded
           George was the only one to survive. Johnny arrived after the massacre
           to see George stumbling out of the building and driving home. After
           staggering home, George heard Sherry call him from the back bedroom.
           He confronted his wife Sherry: (&quot;Why did you do it?&quot;), and
           denounced her for conspiring with Val and planning to run away with
           him. Before expiring, George shot her in the abdomen, and then fell to
           the floor, dead. Meanwhile, Johnny had crammed
           the cash into a recently-purchased, cheap large suitcase (but couldn't
           lock the overstuffed case), and met girlfriend Fay at the airport
           - with tickets for a flight to Boston.  The doomed circumstances of
           the heist came to fruition when a baggage-cart driver swerved to avoid
           a poodle-dog on the tarmac, and sent Johnny's checked heavy suitcase
           of stolen money off the cart onto the runway where it broke open -
           there was the incredible visual shot of an airplane propeller blowing
           away the fallen suitcase's contents of banknotes that whirled all
           over the runway. In  the final scene, authorities
           were alerted and Johnny was being approached by armed and alerted
           plainclothes policemen to arrest him.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Walter Lang<br />
              Director Walter Lang's dramatic musical version of Richard Rodgers
              and Oscar Hammerstein's 1951 Broadway hit was one of the highlights
              of the &quot;Golden Age of Musicals.&quot; It was based upon real-life characters
              from the 1860s, including English schoolteacher Anna Leonowens
              and the stubborn and imperious King Mongkut of Siam. In the film's
              opening set in 1862, widowed, prim and Victorian English (Welsh)
              governess Anna Leonowens (Deborah Kerr) arrived by ship in Bangkok,
              Siam (Thailand). She had been hired to be a schoolmistress to tutor
              the King's royal children in learning English. She was accompanied
              by her excited young son Louis (Rex Thompson). The strong-willed
              Anna was shocked when the intimidating and stern Prime Minister
              Kralahome (Martin Benson) informed her that he had come to escort
              them to their living quarters in the Royal Palace, rather than
              in a separate residence as called for in her contract. Throughout
              the film, she often confronted the autocratic, pompous and misogynistic
              King Mongkut (Yul Brynner in a star-making and Oscar-winning role)
              who had many wives in a harem and dozens of children. In a dark
              subplot, the King's unhappy Burmese slave-concubine named Tuptim
              (Rita Moreno, a Puerto Rican actress) was in a forbidden romance
              with the Burmese ambassador Lun Tha (Carlos Rivas) who had brought
              her to the palace. After being charmed by the King's cute children,
              Anna agreed to remain for the time being (and live in the Palace).
              Anna taught modern, advanced truths and new, more complicated and
              confounding &quot;scientific&quot; wonders to the King's children, wives,
              and the Crown Prince Chowfa Chulalongkorn (Patrick Adiarte). One
              of the King's and Anna's many conversations was about the institution
              of slavery and human rights, and President Lincoln's strategy to
              win the Civil War in America to end slavery. Prime Minister Kralahome
              privately expressed his concern that Anna's teachings were contrary
              to the country's traditional ways, and that she was duping herself
              to believe that she could change the stubborn King's opinions.
              Daringly, Anna helped to facilitate a rendezvous between the two
              lovers Tuptim and Lun Tha. Prime Minister Kralahome brought rumors
              and reports of &quot;Western treachery&quot; and
              the spread of British imperialism that regarded the King as an &quot;unfit&quot; ruler
        of Siam. The King's Number One Wife Lady Thiang (Terry Saunders) persuaded
              Anna to provide guidance and advice to the distressed and anxious
              King Mongkut, who had been called a &quot;barbarian&quot; and feared
              having his kingdom overthrown and turned into a protectorate. Anna
               skillfully suggested that he personally host and honor  foreign
              guests with a high-class banquet (with European food and music).
              The two &quot;distinguished&quot;
            British envoys arriving from Singapore for a &quot;friendship tour&quot; in
            one week were Ambassador Sir John Hay (Alan Mowbray) and Sir Edward
            Ramsay (Geoffrey Toone) (one of Anna's old admirers before she was
        married). The event was impressive and went extremely well, until  the
            after-dinner theatrical entertainment for the banquet guests - Tuptim's
            narrated  traditional Siamese ballet to retell a version of
            Harriet Beecher Stowe's controversial anti-slavery book <i>Uncle
            Tom's Cabin</i>.
            When the play ended, Tuptim had disappeared to run away from her
            own enslavement to join her lover Lun Tha. Although the King and
            Anna shared a wonderful dance-waltz number (<i>Shall We Dance</i>),
            news came from the Kralahome of Tuptim's capture, and the King ordered
            that his dishonored slave-wife should be whipped. Anna begged for
            mercy, but when the King grabbed a whip to personally conduct the
            punishment, she called him a &quot;barbarian.&quot; As
            the authoritarian King was about to strike, he crumpled over, grabbed
            his chest and raced from the room. Then, a report arrived that the
            body of Tuptim's lover was found in a river, and Tuptim reacted in
            shock as she was led away in tears. Anna returned the King's
              gift of a ring, cut off all of her responsibilities as a governess,
              and declared that she would be leaving on the next boat out of
        Siam with her son Louis. Several weeks later, Anna learned that the King
        was dying after isolating himself and refusing food. She read a letter
        that the despondent King had written about his deep gratitude
        and respect for her although they often clashed over major differences.
        She was ushered to the King's deathbed, where in an emotional scene,
        she spoke a few final words with the King. Anna promised to remain in
            Bangkok to provide guidance for the  future king. The newly-appointed
            young Prince issued two proclamations to his subjects, and became
            more resolute as he spoke about how he would no longer require bowing
            before the King, as the ex-King quietly expired nearby. In the film's
            final moment, Anna placed her face next to the King's limp left hand
            following his death.  </font></p></td>

            S'est &eacute;chapp&eacute; ou Le Vent Souffle o&ugrave; il Veut)</b>,
        99 minutes, D: Robert Bresson<br />
        French director Robert Bresson's dramatic, suspenseful, documentary-styled
        wartime POW jailbreak-escape thriller - an effective story of intense
        courage and perseverance, was based on a true story about French Resistance
        fighting member Andr&eacute; Devigny who was held in Fort Montluc prison
        at Lyon by the occupying German Gestapo during WWII in 1943. In the stunning,
        suspenseful opening sequence, seen without dialogue, condemned Nazi prisoner,
        French Resistance fighter Lt. Fontaine (Francois Leterrier) made his
        first escape attempt from the back seat of a car as he was being transported
        to the Montluc prison in Lyon, France. After failing in the effort, Fontaine
        arrived unconscious on a stretcher at his prison cell. There was clear
        evidence that he had been severely pistol-whipped and beaten off-screen.
        He was incarcerated in solitary confinement in a claustrophobic, sparsely-furnished
        small cell (3 x 2 meters) on the lower level. For much of the film, he
        was imprisoned in unpredictable and despairing circumstances, but refused
        to be resigned to his fate. He struggled to endure and survive and overcome
        his oppressive condition. Lt. Fontaine was brought to the prison office
        where he was forced to promise that he wouldn't make another escape attempt.
        However, he affirmed in voice-over: &quot;As for me, I decided to escape
        as soon as possible.&quot; The film often
        used a passive camera to portray the Germans, who were often seen
        as shadowy, undetailed characters, often leading prisoners around,
        or  executing convicts (with most of the events outside the
        cell remaining off-screen). Then, unexpectedly after 15 days, he was
        suddenly transferred from his first-floor cell to a different cell (#
        107) on the top floor, where he wasn't required to be shackled but was
        actually more limited. In voice-over, he described
        how only once a day, he was allowed to leave his cell to wash up and
        empty his slop bucket, where he attempted to speak to other convicts.
        Much of the film detailed the sequences of Fontaine's painstaking, meticulous
        and patient planning for a future escape from the stark prison - he completely
        deconstructed his entire cell for purposes of creating makeshift tools
        for escape, using materials such as his whittled-down iron spoon to function
        as a chisel to disassemble his wooden cell door. He was also introduced
        to  a new prisoner named Orsini (Jacques Ertaud), who expressed his interest
        in partnering with Fontaine in escaping. The Lieutenant was able to scope
        out the layout of the prison one night when he went on an exploratory
        trip.  Fontaine also began to construct braided, wire-reinforced rope
        from materials in his cell. He monotonously proceeded to take apart his
        bed, his mattress and wire-netting/springs, and later, he also used pillow
        cloth, other strips of ripped clothing and a blanket to make rope. The
        anxious Orsini, who thought Fontaine's plan was too lengthy and complicated,
        decided to escape on his own. He unwisely attempted a prison escape in
        broad daylight during slop-bucket disposal, and was caught on the rooftop.
        He shared one vital piece of information with Fontaine before he was
        executed the next day - he simply advised that Fontaine would need
        metal grappling hooks for the ends of his ropes:
              &quot;You'll need hooks, Fontaine&quot; to scale the walls. During
              a brief off-prison trip to the notorious Hotel Terminus (Gestapo
              headquarters), Fontaine was informed that his case was officially
              closed. He had been charged with treasonous espionage and sabotage
              (a bombing of a bridge) against the Nazis - both punishable by
        death, and was to be executed in a few days. After he was returned to
              his cell, he was unexpectedly joined by a young  cellmate
              - 16 year-old, teenaged conscripted soldier who had deserted -
              Fran&ccedil;ois Jost (Charles Le Clainche). During a long conversation
              with him, the troubled Fontaine viewed Jost suspiciously and with
              uncertainty (and regarded him as either a potentially untrustworthy
        spy and stool pigeon, or as a  partner). He took a chance on
        Jost escaping with him, and told Jost that he no longer had a &quot;choice,&quot; now
        that he had seen one of his grappling hooks and knew of his escape plan.
        Fortunately, Jost agreed to join him. In the film's final 20 minute sequence,
        the two made a daring, tense, and determined escape attempt together
        in the middle of a foggy and dark night - with only a limited amount
        of time to succeed before sunrise. They had to get to the rooftop through
        a skylight, scale down into the courtyard and silently kill the armed
        guard stationed there, get back onto the roof and then cross-over a wide
        corridor between the prison's inner and outer walls, without alerting
        a guard on a squeaky bike who was riding around the perimeter. At about
        4 am after a long period of hesitation, Fontaine 
        finally gathered up his courage and shimmied across the rope (that
        held his weight) between the two walls, and dropped to the ground
        outside the prison. Jost joined him and they embraced outside the prison's
        walls. The two  walked away from the prison, now freed, down a backstreet in Lyon. </font></p></td>

            D: Nunnally Johnson<br />
          Director/co-writer Nunnally Johnson's low-key, epic-length
            drama with romantic elements  was based on the 1955 novel by
          Sloan Wilson (originally serialized in mid-1955 in <i>Collier's Magazine</i>).
            It told about a discontented 'Everyman' character, typical of the
            1950s Eisenhower-era in the post-war period - the main title character
          was a man of conscience who faced multiple issues and sought to find
          meaning and happiness in life. Tom Rath (Gregory
              Peck), a hard-working, conservative-minded, decent, stolid, middle-aged
              war veteran in the mid-1950s faced challenging issues with conforming and reintegrating
          back into society - in both his career and married life (with three
          young children). In the middle-class Connecticut suburbs (where he
          had lived for seven years), his emotionally-overwrought homemaker-wife
          Betsy Rath (Jennifer Jones) was dissatisfied, pushy, and continually
          nagged and complained about their financial situation. She wanted her
          husband to leave his &quot;safe&quot; non-profit foundation job in NYC and  
          take a higher-paying position. She felt he was cowardly and unambitious
          since his war years: &quot;You've lost your guts, and all of a 
		  sudden I'm ashamed of you.&quot; Suffering
          from PTSD, Rath experienced three troubling flashbacks to 10 years
          earlier when he served in WWII in Europe. Many of his worries were
          about killing in combat, slitting the throat of a young German soldier
          to acquire his warm coat, and the accidental hand-grenade killing of
          his best friend Hank. During one long flashback set in mid-1945 in
          Rome, he also became involved in a six-week relationship with pretty
          Italian woman Maria Montagne (Marisa Pavan). Due to Betsy's urgings,
          Tom applied for a better-paying public
          relations job with the national TV broadcasting company UBC in NYC.
          Fortunately for Rath, during the job application process, the powerful,
          go-getter businessman boss - network president Ralph Hopkins (Fredric
          March), took an instant liking to the tone of Tom's forthright, short
          and honest application and was interested in hiring him. Rath was soon
          hired for a six-month trial period to write draft speeches for
          his boss for a nationwide mental health campaign - Hopkins' pet project.
          Other conflicts arose when shady, long-time caretaker Edward Schultz
          (Joseph Sweeney) contested the inheritance stated in the will of Rath's recently-deceased
          grandmother regarding her estate's fortune and suburban Connecticut
          house. The case was being handled by small-town Judge Alfred Bernstein
          (Lee J. Cobb), the executor and probate officer of the entire estate.
          It was clearly possible that Schultz had forged a new bequeathing letter,
          and absconded with the elderly Mrs. Rath's funds. During his first
          few weeks at his new UBC job, Rath was befriended by his boss Hopkins,
          who was also experiencing serious domestic-front issues. His 18 year-old
          spoiled, rebellious, and unreasonable party-girl daughter Susan &quot;Suzy&quot; Hopkins
          (Gigi Perreau) was threatening to elope and marry a notorious older
          fortune-hunting individual named Byron Holgate. After being urged by
          his estanged wife Helen Hopkins (Ann Harding) to attend to the situation
          immediately, his efforts to talk sense with his daughter failed, and
          she went ahead with the elopement. In his job, Rath faced a dilemma
          - should he be forthright and honest in his assessment of a speech
           promoting a mental health campaign and prepared for Hopkins' delivery
          to a convention of doctors? Or should he please his boss by playing
          along and telling him only what he wanted to hear (so that he wouldn't
          lose his job)? At first, Rath felt he must abide by 'office-politics',
          with concerns about how his integrity had become more difficult with
          a wife and three children. However, after Hopkins shared his domestic
          issues with him, and instructed Rath to spend more time with his own
          kids, Rath came to realize that the success of his boss had come at
          the cost of personal happiness, and at the expense of his family. He
          decided to give his boss a different critique and abruptly changed
          his opinion of the speech - he called it &quot;phony&quot; and &quot;untrue.&quot; At
          the same, Rath received news that his war-time romance had led to Maria's
               impregnation - their love-making had produced a secret love child
          son and he felt obligated to send money to her. In the interest of
              honesty and truthfulness, he divulged to Betsy that he had fathered
          an illegitimate child during the war years and now vowed to help support
          the mother and especially her son. He explained how he met the girl
          when he was at his most hopeless, scared and depressed state, and thought
              he wouldn't survive the war. Predictably, Betsy was furious and
              devastated, raced off in the family car, and didn't surface until
              the next morning after she ran out of gas. The film concluded with
              Rath's decision to  forgo
              career advancement with his workaholic boss, in favor of spending
          more time with his family as a '9 to 5' man. He also made arrangements
          with Judge Bernstein to send regular payments of $100/month to unmarried
          mother Maria to support her and their son. Now supportive of her husband,
          Betsy added that they eventually wanted to set up a trust fund for
          the young son. Moved by Betsy's added gesture, Bernstein offered his
          services for free. The couple were reconciled when in their car, Rath
          told Betsy: &quot;Would you mind if I tell you, I worship you?&quot; </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), </b>120 minutes,
              D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
              Hitchcock's VistaVision and Technicolored suspense-thriller, an
              assassination mystery, was the only one in his entire filmography
              that he made twice. The first was a decidedly B/W British version
              made in 1934, shorter by 45 minutes and less sophisticated technically,
              that starred Peter Lorre as the criminal villain named Abbott.
              The 1956 production opened with  title credits
              that appeared over a view of a performing orchestra, with its finale
              marked by clashing cymbals (a foreshadowing), and the title screen
              prologue: &quot;A single crash of Cymbals and how it rocked the
              lives of an American family.&quot; An
              American family (from Indianapolis, Indiana), the McKennas, was
              introduced - the family consisted of surgeon-husband Dr. Benjamin
              or &quot;Ben&quot; McKenna
            (James Stewart), his newly-retired professional singer-wife Josephine
            or &quot;Jo&quot; (Doris Day), and their 11 year-old son Henry &quot;Hank&quot; (Christopher
            Olsen).   They were on a bus traveling from Casablanca to the city
            of Marrakesh in French Morocco (in Northern Africa), after attendance
            at a Paris medical conference. During
            their trip, one of their first acquaintances was friendly, handsome
            Frenchman Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin) - a man who initially appeared
            to fit the title as a &quot;man who knew too much&quot;; he intervened
            when Hank accidentally pulled off the veil of one of the local Muslim
            women. In the McKennas' hotel-room in Marrakesh, the family
            was startled when a sinister-looking man knocked
            at their door. [Note: He would later be identified
            as Rien (Reggie Nalder), a hired assassin]. Louis Bernard
            was in the McKenna's hotel room and witnessed the incident, and then
            abruptly cancelled his dinner plans with them. That evening in a
            local Arab restaurant in Marrakesh over dinner, the McKennas met
            a friendly English couple: Lucy (Brenda De Banzie) and Edward
            Drayton (Bernard Miles);  it was unusual that
            Louis Bernard was also in attendance at the restaurant, but basically
            ignored the McKennas.   [Note - Spoiler: the Draytons were later
            revealed to be the real criminals - leaders of an anarchist terrorist
            group involved in an assassination plot.] While the
            McKennas were in a crowded Marrakesh bazaar marketplace the next
            day with the Draytons (and Hitchcock's customary cameo appearance
            watching acrobats), they saw a robed, dark-skinned man, obviously
            with face paint, being chased by police, and then stumbling into
            the square and falling to the ground, with a knife sticking out of
            his back. He reached out to speak to Dr. McKenna: (&quot;Monsieur
            McKenna. I'm Louis Bernard&quot;); as the disguised Arab died in
            Ben's arms, his face paint rubbed off, revealing he was Frenchman
            Bernard whom the McKennas had met earlier. With his dying words,
            he whispered a secret to Ben (with a close-up of his ear) - cryptic
            news of an impending assassination: &quot;A man, a statesman, is
            to be killed, assassinated, in London. Soon, very soon. Tell them
            in London to try Ambrose Chappell.&quot; Ben
            was mystified and spoke to Jo:  &quot;Why should he pick me out
            to tell?&quot; Afterwards, while speaking to police authorities,
            it was revealed that Bernard was a French intelligence agent working
            there in Morocco, part of the Deuxime Bureau, better known as the &quot;American
              FBI&quot;; he had been investigating a potential murder of a statesman,
              and shared the secret of what he had discovered with Dr. McKenna:
              (&quot;The
            dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover. That's
            why he was killed. He told you what he had discovered... Because
            he placed complete confidence in you&quot;).  Dr.
            McKenna received an ominous phone call in the police headquarters,
            revealing that son  &quot;Hank&quot;
          had been kidnapped for blackmailing purposes: (&quot;If you tell even
          one word of what Louis Bernard whispered to you in the marketplace,
          your little boy will be in serious danger. Remember, say nothing&quot;).
          Dr. McKenna described his sudden revelation to Jo, that he had figured
          out why they had been approached by Bernard before his death - they
          had been mis-identified as a couple (the Draytons from London) that
          Bernard was suspiciously tracking.  The  Draytons  
            were thought to be involved, forcing Ben (now the &quot;man who knew
            too much&quot;) and Jo to travel to England to avert a suspected
          assassination attempt and save Hank. Dr. McKenna went off track and
            was delayed the next day in his search back in London - when he met
            with two taxidermists, both named Ambrose Chappell, Sr. (George Howe)
            and Jr. (Richard Wordsworth) - he suddenly and shockingly realized
            that he had misinterpreted Bernard's whisper; he had assumed that
            Ambrose Chapell was a person instead of a place -  and
            it was where Hank was being held hostage by the Draytons. Finally
            at the Ambrose Chapel, Edward Drayton was discovered leading a service,
            and revealed to be part of an anarchist terrorist group that was
            holding Hank hostage. The film concluded at London's
          famous Royal Albert Hall in a very suspenseful, wordless, 12-minute
          climactic sequence during a concert performance (of the London Symphony
          Orchestra conducted by Bernard Herrmann); both Jo and Ben McKenna was
            keenly aware of a planned assassination plot of some sort (the murder
            of visiting foreign dignitary - Prime Minister (Alexis Bobrinskoy)),
            about to take place at the end of the performance of Arthur Benjamin's <i>Storm
            Clouds Cantata </i> during
          a dramatic clash of cymbals, by Drayton's hired gunman Rien (Reggie
          Nalder); the gunshot was timed to coincide and be drowned out by the
          clash of cymbals at the end of a symphonic concert. The
          final climactic moment came when a gun barrel was visible pointing
          out from behind a red box curtain in the balcony. At the moment of
          the potential fatal shot, Jo let go a terrifying, shrieking scream,
          upsetting the gunman's timing and causing him to miss his mark - his
          targeted statesman was only wounded in the arm. Ben fought with
              the assassin, who fell to his death when he tumbled from the balcony.
          Later, the Draytons were hiding out in a foreign embassy with the Ambassador
              (Mogens Wieth) who had hired them for the assassination job. The
              McKennas were invited by the Prime Minister to the embassy, where
              Jo was asked to sing the film's Academy Award-winning Best Song: &quot;Que
              Sera, Sera&quot; (&quot;Whatever
            Will Be, Will Be&quot;) - Hank's favorite bedtime tune. Held captive
            in the embassy by his kidnappers the Draytons, Hank
            heard his mother's voice and responded by whistling back - leading
            to his rescue and the death of Edward Drayton who fell down a flight
            of stairs and accidentally shot himself.</font></p>          </td>

              <font size="2">Warner Bros' and director Huston's dramatic and
                  tragic chase-adventure film was based on Herman Melville's
                  1851 novel <i>Moby Dick</i>, about the obsessive, self-destructive
                   hunt by a possessed and mad sea-captain for a legendary great white whale. Scripted
                  by both Ray Bradbury and Huston himself, the film's complex
                  themes were numerous: good vs. evil, and man vs. God, amongst
                  others. The film opened in New England in the year 1841 with
                  a very-familiar three words: &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; -
                  referring to the film's voice-over narrator (Richard Basehart)
                  who arrived by foot at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
                  His intention was to sign on as a sailor on the whaling ship
                  the <i>Pequod</i>. The eager and adventuresome Ishmael spent the night in a boarding
                  house with a &quot;strange bedfellow&quot; - tattooed Pacific
                  Islander harpooner Queequeg (Friedrich von Ledebur). Both were
                  hired the next day to join Captain Ahab (Gregory Peck), in
                  his demonic and maniacal quest for a white whale. Before leaving,
                  Ishmael attended a church service led by Puritanical Father
                  Mapple (Orson Welles), who delivered a long, stirring, cautionary
                  sermon from a prow-shaped pulpit about the Biblical character
                  of Job and the consequences of disobeying God's will; he ranted about
                  the battle of good vs. evil in the soul of man, with nautical
                  metaphors, reference to St. Paul, and inspiration from the
                  Biblical whale tale of Jonah. The <i>Pequod</i> made its sailing
                  departure from Nantucket for a whaling expedition, with one-legged
                  Captain Ahab, who made a dramatic entrance and was described
                  in voice-over: (&quot;His whole, high, broad form weighed down upon
                  a barbaric white leg carved from the jawbone of a whale. He
                  did not feel the wind or smell the salt air. He only stood
                  staring at the horizon with the marks of some inner crucifixion
                  and woe deep in his face&quot;);  in the
                  subsequent scene, Ahab described the curious crew's prey, a
                  great white whale. He offered a &quot;Spanish gold ounce&quot; to
                  the first one who sighted the whale.  And then throughout the
                  sailing, Ahab vengefully ranted and raved about
                  the injustice of his own maiming (he lost his left leg and
                  had a replacement peg leg) on a previous voyage years earlier
                  against the monstrous beast. The crew
                  toasted their objective - to bring &quot;Death
            to Moby Dick.&quot; Captain Ahab also eloquently
            delivered a monologue to Quaker Chief Mate Starbuck (Leo Genn), about
            how he began hunting whales forty years earlier as a &quot;boy harpooner&quot;;
            he described his relentless, obsessive search every since to pursue
            the great white whale Moby Dick During the journey, Starbuck suggested
            a mutiny against Ahab's insane quest to change course from
            successful whaling, in order to follow reports of Moby Dick's
            whereabouts. He spoke to his fellow officers: cheerful, pipe-smoking
            2nd mate Stubb (Harry Andrews) and 3rd mate Flask (Seamus Kelly),
            but they resisted him. Starbuck reacted by
            expressing the inevitability of their pre-determined fate, if he
            couldn't end Ahab's life with one gunshot. He  trembled before
            Ahab, knowing he could not stop him. A foreshadowing
            of the ship's fate came with Queequeg's order to have the ship's
            carpenter construct a water-proofed coffin for him. During their
            ominous and unholy search for the whale, the <i>Pequod</i> came
            upon the <i>Rachel</i>, another whaling ship from New Bedford.
            Captain Gardiner (Francis de Wolff) requested that Ahab aid
            in a search for his missing youngest son who had been carried
            away by the whale, but Ahab coldly refused. After
            a damaging typhoon,  Ahab confirmed that he sensed that they were
            close to the white whale, and shortly later, Moby Dick was finally
            spotted and there came the cry: (&quot;Thar she blows!&quot;). Ahab
        ordered his harpooners and crew to pursue the beast in long boats, for
            an ill-fated chase. Ahab was finally able
            to encounter his nemesis - the great white whale. The whale furiously
            retaliated and counter-attacked in a thrilling sequence. Ahab's
            harpoon struck the side of the whale, but also ensnared him in the
            weapon's rope; lashed up against
            Moby Dick, he became entangled in the harpoon ropes wrapping
            around the mortally-wounded creature, but still frantically
            stabbed at the whale's side until it submerged and drowned him. 
             The sailors watched as the whale surfaced, and saw that the dead
            Ahab's loose arm was signaling to them: &quot;You see? Do you see?
            Ahab beckons. He's dead, but he beckons&quot;; they saw the monstrous
            wounded whale continue its rampage against the ship - it returned
            to the <i>Pequod</i> to sink it by circling around it and creating a deadly, maelstrom whirlpool,
            killing all crew members except the sole-surviving Ishmael. A
            final voice-over was presented by Ishmael, who was rescued by clinging
            and resting on Queequeg's coffin; he was later picked up and saved
            by the <i> Rachel </i>- he was the only one left to tell the tale
            of what had happened: (&quot;Drowned Queequeg's coffin was my life
            buoy. For one whole day and night, it sustained me on that soft and
            dirge-like main. Then a sail appeared. It was the <i>Rachel</i>.
            The<i> Rachel</i>, who in her long melancholy search for her missing children found
            another orphan. The drama's done. All are departed away. The great
            shroud of the sea rolls over the <i>Pequod</i>, her crew and Moby
            Dick. I only am escaped, alone to tell thee&quot;).</font></p>          </td>

            Cook<br />
          Director Fielder Cook's drama was originally produced  as
          a teleplay written by Rod Serling (who became
          well-known after the debut of his 5-season TV series <i>Twilight Zone</i> beginning
          in 1959). The teleplay first aired on NBC's <i>The
          Kraft Television Theatre</i> in early 1955 before Serling wrote an
          adaptation and it was produced as a feature-length film, following
          in the footsteps of a similar teleplay that became a successful film
          - <a href="mart.html"><i>Marty
          (1955)</i></a>.  This boardroom-office melodrama
          (without a musical score) - about a back-stabbing
          power struggle and ladder-climbing within corporate big business (&quot;survival
          of the fittest&quot;) and 'gray flannel suits' - was similar in plot
          to MGM's <i>Executive Suite (1954)</i>. It featured the sensationalist
          tagline: &quot;Ruthless
          Men And Ambitious Women...Clawing For Control Of A Billion Dollar Empire!!!&quot; The
          B/W drama was filmed in a Brooklyn studio and on-location in NYC. The
          film gave  a compelling portrait of a giant industrial corporation
          - Ramsey &amp; Co.
          The high-powered company occupying the 40th floor of a skyscraper
          was headed by ruthless, menacing, callous, and harsh profit-driven
          business executive Walter Ramsey (Everett Sloane). His assistant general
          manager was aging, 62 year-old, long-time executive VP William &quot;Bill&quot; Briggs
            (Ed Begley). With over 30 years of
            service, and one of the corporation's founders with Walter's father
          Jim, the humanistic-minded, decent and honorable Briggs was suffering
          from medical issues related to heart problems and an ulcer. Ramsey's
          cool, no-nonsense and efficient head secretary Miss Margaret Lanier
          (Joanna Roos) was assigned to prepare for a new hire's arrival. In
          the film's early scenes, young and ambitious production engineer Fred
          Staples (Van Heflin) had been newly-recruited from the small industrial
          town of Mansfield, Ohio, where he had worked for six years at Queen
          City Tool &amp; Die when his company had been acquired by Ramsey. He
           had been relocated to a new suburban country house  with his social-climbing
           wife Nancy (Beatrice Straight). Once Fred arrived for his first day
          of work, and after taking the Tower Elevator to enter the offices,
          he was shown his own luxurious private office. He met the personable,
          kind-hearted, ethical and honorable VP Briggs, and expressed
          immediate amazement to Briggs about how he was slightly taken aback
          by everything. Bill's secretary
           Marge Fleming (Elizabeth Wilson) for the previous seven years had
         been permanently reassigned to Staples, without Bill's prior knowledge
          - and she was devastated and considered resigning. In 
          a board meeting in the conference room headed by Ramsey, one of the
          film's earliest contentious issues became evident during a discussion
          of the brutal, heartless, planned purchase proposal of a bankrupt company
          in the small village of Williamston. Briggs was the sole voice to disagree
          with Ramsey and mention that the plant was employing 900 men - half
          of the inhabitants, and that the acquisition would decimate the community
          for 6 months until the men were rehired. Ramsey counter-argued that
          more men would eventually be hired: &quot;We're not going to ruin that
          town, we're goiing to make it!&quot; and that it would help the corporation's
          bottom-line. He also insulted Briggs with a tongue-lashing about not
          having an original idea or point-of-view in his head for many years,
          while complimenting Staples for refraining to offer an opinion until
          he had more information. Unable to fire Briggs due to his seniority,
          Ramsey's devious plan was soon revealed - to degrade and exasperate
          Briggs by bringing him to the brink of resignation or retirement rather
          than firing him, for reasons related to his poor health and his inability
          to adjust to changing times. Ramsey was also openly grooming Staples
              to replace him. Briggs was self-aware of the strategy to get rid
              of him. Fred began to realize that he had been brought in by the
              demanding Ramsey to eventually replace Briggs as VP and industrial
              relations manager. A series of incidents occurred in which Ramsey
              treated Briggs with condescension and degradation, and stressfully
              humiliated him. A final confrontation between them in the conference
          room saw Ramsey refusing to give credit to Briggs for his contributions
          to Staples' Portland projects proposal report, and then suggesting
          that Briggs step down. Shortly later after the meeting adjourned, Briggs
          collapsed and died of a heart-attack in the hallway. Fred was outraged
          by Ramsey's brutal treatment of Briggs, considered resigning from his
          position, and he angrily told Ramsey how he truly felt. Ramsey admitted
          that he was a despicable human being. Fred continued to argue with
          Ramsey, who described how one had to be ruthless to succeed in business
              - and Briggs had failed in his responsibilities. Fred rejected
              Ramsey's implication that he would now be replacing the failed
              Briggs. Ramsey continued to reason with Fred and tempt him to stay
              by offering him a challenging position in the corporation, but
              Fred was fed up with Ramsey's attitude and personal callousness:
              (&quot;I don't like you. I don't like anything about you&quot;).
              Although the two hated each other, Ramsey knew he could get the
              embittered Fred to remain at the corporation by offering him a
              way to realize his full potential and find happiness. The
            ambitious-minded  Fred was enticed to take Bill's
            place; although upset by the whole situation, he was tempted by
            Ramsey's offer of a double salary, stock options, and an unlimited
            expense account, and he decided to accept the now-vacant secondary
            VP position. However, in a final showdown sequence with Ramsey, Fred
            threatened that he would never allow Ramsey to abuse him, and would
            never give Ramsey any peace as his second-in-command, because he
            would be angling for his top job. Fred also added one reservation
            - and that he wanted it added to his contract - that he could break
        Ramsey's jaw.</font></p>        </td>

                Rouge)</strong>, 34 minutes, D: Albert Lamorisse<br />
                French writer/director Albert Lamorisse's imaginative,
           short fantasy drama - a wonderful, mostly-visual children's tale,
           was about an unlikely friendship between a boy and an inanimate object
           - a bright-red balloon, that became his soulmate and a symbol of trust,
           loyalty and love. In the story set in the M&eacute;nilmontant, a working-class
           district of Paris, a young, 6 year-old tow-headed adolescent schoolboy
           named Pascal (Pascal Lamorisse, the director's son) spied a lamp-post
           and balcony railing that had the trailing string of a solid red, glossy,
           helium-filled balloon tangled up in it; he climbed up the lamp-post,
           untied it and took the balloon with him. He wasn't permitted to
           take the balloon on the streetcar to school, so he ran to the Boys
           Community School with the balloon held on a string trailing behind
           him. The balloon waited for him until school was dismissed and they
           returned home to his upstairs apartment.  His mother (Ren&eacute;e
           Marion) prohibited him from having the balloon indoors, until Pascal
           was able to open the window (without his mother watching) and allow
           the balloon inside his room for the night. On his way to school the
           next day, the  balloon took on its own personality
           when it seemed to playfully misbehave by staying just out of arm's
           reach from Pascal. Once he arrived at school,  the harsh school principal
           arrived,  and dragged Pascal away from his class to discipline the
           boy for bringing the misbehaving, prankish balloon with him to school.
           In a street marketplace on the way home after school, the balloon
           paused in front of a mirror to admire itself, imitating Pascal who
           had also become intrigued by and was studying a life-sized portrait
           or painted image of a young girl his age that was for sale. Further
           along on their trip home, they encountered a young girl (Sabine Lamorisse,
           the director's daughter) who was accompanied by a blue helium-filled
           balloon, and a flirtatious attraction developed between the two balloons.
           Inevitably, a gang of older bullies in the neighborhood were attracted
           by the boy with his balloon, but the two were able to evade them.
           When Pascal attended church with his mother, the balloon couldn't
           resist following them inside, where an angry church official kicked
           them out. Pascal visited a bakery shop and instructed his obedient
           balloon to wait outside. While he was inside the shop, the mean bullies
           came along and successfully snatched the balloon, took it to a vacant
           lot, and heartlessly pelted it with rocks and slingshots to torment
           it, and they tried to pop and deflate the balloon. Pascal rescued
           and protected the balloon, and they were able to run away - they were
           chased through various Parisian alleyways. Once the large gang of boys
           caught up to them, they recaptured the red balloon and resumed their
           punishment. In the film's most heartbreaking and anthropomorphic sequence,
           and often recognized as a Christ-like sequence of sacrifice and reincarnation
           (or resurrection), damage to the balloon from a sling-shot rock caused
           it to slowly deflate and descend to the ground. One of the boys cruelly
           stomped on the inanimate balloon to effectively kill it. Pascal was
           devastated by the loss of his friend-companion that was now torn and
           unrecognizable. In the very sweet, uplifting, transcendent, enchanting
           and magical surprise ending, thousands of other colored balloons
            from around Paris empathically rebelled and broke away
            from their owners and rose up into the sky. The
            large collection of balloons had rallied together and converged to
           where Pascal was sitting with his dead balloon. Pascal
           reached up and tied all of their strings together, and then held on
           as the massive group of vibrantly, multi-colored balloons lifted him
           up from the ground and carried him off on a ride over the entire Parisian
           cityscape and on to another world, high above the fray.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: John Ford<br />
            John Ford's complex, epic, 'psychological' Western story was about
            a man's obsessive five year quest for revenge, set in post-Civil
            War America. It was based on the best-selling 1954 novel by Alan
            Le May. This film was unquestionably Ford's finest, most influential,
            and most-admired film, and beautifully shot in his most popular
            locale, Monument Valley, but this exceptional film - a true American
            masterpiece of filmmaking, was not nominated for Academy Awards.
             As the film began in Texas of 1868, embittered loner and mysterious
            Civil War ex-Confederate soldier Ethan Edwards (John Wayne in a complex
            character role) entered on horseback, and arrived at the solitary,
            Texas frontier farm of his estranged brother Aaron Edwards' (Walter
            Coy) family with radiant wife Martha (Dorothy Jordan) - everyone
            expectantly watched his approach, including Ethan's two nieces: young
            Debbie Edwards (Lana Wood) and her older sister Lucy (Pippa Scott).
            Tension developed between the two brothers, because of Ethan's long-suppressed
            love for Aaron's wife Martha. Strains also developed between prejudiced,
            racist Indian hater and anti-hero Ethan and Aaron's half-breed adopted
            son, part-Cherokee (one-eighth) Martin &quot;Marty&quot; 
          Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter). When the deputized Ethan and Martin
              joined a posse of Texas Rangers to investigate for Comanche marauders
          or cattle rustlers, they didn't  
          know that they were deliberately being lured away. Upon their return
          to the Edwards' homestead, menacing renegade
          Chief Scar (Henry Brandon) had already attacked and butchered most
          of the family (including Ethan's sister-in-law and brother), and both
          of Ethan's young nieces had been kidnapped. The racially-hateful Ethan
          began a perilous, extensive, relentless, and grim five years-long search
          for his kidnapped niece (conveyed by a series of flashbacks) - to kill
          the Chief who abducted her AND to kill his corrupted, tainted, disgraced
          niece to 'save' her from her savage captors.  The film was noted
          for Ethan's oft-repeated phrase: &quot;That'll be the day.&quot; During
            his quest, Ethan was joined by his nephew Marty, who was equally
          determined to save the girl. During their hunt, Ethan found Lucy's
          mutilated and raped body, and told teenaged Brad Jorgensen (Harry Carey
          Jr.), Lucy's sweetheart and fiancee. Brad was crazed with grief, and
          believing that Lucy was still alive, he rode into the Indian camp and
          was shot to death. After many years, Martin attempted a daring rescue
          after he had located now-adolescent Debbie (Natalie Wood) in Scar's
          teepee - she had become one of the squaws of Comanche Chief Scar. During
          a daring pre-dawn rescue attempt, he shot and killed the Indian chief
          and then Ethan scalped his corpse. In the next dramatic scene, Ethan
          chased on horseback after Debbie - ostensibly to kill her, as Martin
          yelled out: &quot;No, no, Ethan!&quot; -
          as she ran down a hill and toward a cave,  Ethan scooped her into
          his arms in one motion, lifted her into the air, and unexpectedly told
          her: &quot;Let's go home, Debbie.&quot; The
              film concluded with a family reunion back at the Jorgensen frontier
              home where Debbie was delivered and welcomed home, and Martin was
              reunited with his long-suffering and patient fiancee Laurie Jorgensen
              (Vera Miles). During the gathering, everyone entered the Jorgensen
          home but Ethan. He did not enter the threshold of the
              house in the final image, although he was framed and isolated as
              a silhouette in the dark doorway - he grabbed his arm and watched
              as reunited friends and family entered the homestead. Then, he
               turned toward the desert behind him and ambled away as the door
              shut behind him. He was  a tragic, 'cursed,' lonely, morally-ambiguous
              figure perenially doomed to wander and be an outsider.</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Cecil B. DeMille<br />
              Cecil B. DeMille's most spectacular and unequalled historical epic
              and also his last film (his 70th) was this  3 hour, 40 minute Technicolored
              film (divided into two parts with an intermission). It was the
              highest-earning live-action film of the decade of the 1950s until <a href="benh.html"><i>Ben-Hur
              (1959)</i></a> toppled it. Considered a remake of DeMille's own
              1923 silent film of the same name, however, its scope was narrowed
              to focus on the previous film's prologue to solely concentrate
              on the character of Moses. Throughout the film, director DeMille
              also served as the film's voice-over narrator. The film's title
              was mostly a misnomer, since the central subject was not The Ten
              Commandments, which appeared only in the film's concluding 20 minutes.
              <i>The Ten Commandments</i> was noted for great fire and brimstone scenes
              (with remarkable special effects) and its huge cast of characters,
              with a very appropriate tagline: &quot;THE GREATEST EPIC OF ALL!&quot; This
              commanding film was the epic account of the liberation of the Hebrew
              people from  bondage by Egyptian prince Moses (Charlton
              Heston). He was born a Hebrew slave, and saved from an edict issued
              by Egypt's Pharaoh Rameses I (Ian Keith) to kill all newborn Hebrew
              males, by his mother Yoshabel (Martha Scott) who set him adrift,
              with help from Moses' sister Miriam (Olive Deering). Found in the
              Nile River as an infant in a reed basket, he was saved by the Pharaoh's
              daughter Bithiah (Nina Foch), a childless widow. Moses (&quot;The
              Prince of Egypt&quot;) was then raised as an adopted foster son
              by Bithiah's brother, royal Egyptian Pharaoh Sethi I (Sir Cedric
              Hardwicke), in approximately the 13th Century BC. Appointed as
              an army general and chief supervisory architect, Moses helped in
              the construction of the giant pyramids for Sethi's Jubilee, fell
              in love with Princess Nefretiri (Anne Baxter), and was hated by
              his half-brother - Sethi's natural son, Rameses (Yul Brynner).
              Once it was discovered that he was born an Israelite through Bithiah's
              traitorous servant Memnet (Judith Anderson) who had kept Moses'
              Levite swaddling clothes, Moses was banished by Rameses. Moses
              returned to Egypt years later (after marrying and bearing a son
              with a Bedouin shepherd named Sephora (Yvonne De Carlo)) to free
              the slaves. He learned of his destiny to confront the Pharaoh and
              lead the Israelites in the spectacular Burning Bush scene on Mt.
              Sinai, when God instructed him to return to Egypt. During a series
              of confrontations with his nemesis Pharaoh Rameses II, Moses challenged
              the ruler with many deadly plagues, including only three that were
              visualized: turning the Nile blood red, fiery hail, and the death
              of the firstborn with a greenish smoke.  Other plagues were
              only mentioned in the dialogue were lice, flies, sickness, boils,
              and three days of darkness. When the Pharaoh finally relented,
              Moses viewed the mass of Hebrews waiting to leave
          Egypt and exclaimed in the enormous crowd scene: &quot;There are so
          many, so many.&quot; As the Hebrews reached the Red Sea, the Pharaoh
          had decided to pursue them by chariot. One of the most miraculous visual
          effects scenes in film history  (in the
            pre-digital and CGI-era) was the parting of the Red Sea, prefaced
          by Moses' statement with outstretched arms: &quot;The Lord of Hosts
          will do battle for us. Behold his mighty hand.&quot; An old man commented: &quot;God
          opens the sea with a blast of His nostrils!&quot; Other memorable scenes
          were dramatically enacted at Mt. Sinai including the creation and delivery
          of the Ten Commandments to Moses by the &quot;finger of God&quot; (fiery
          engravings upon rock tablets), and the orgiastic scene of the Hebrews
          worshipping the idolatrous Golden Calf during Moses' absence. The film
          concluded with the disobedient Hebrew peoples wandering in the desert
          wilderness for 40 years, and their approach to the Promised Land across
          the River Jordan, although Moses stayed behind to ascend Mt. Nebo alone. </font></p></td>

              minutes, D: Douglas Sirk<br />
            Acclaimed director Douglas Sirk's best film was this lush, psychosexual,
            trashy melodrama, adapted from Robert Wilder's novel, about wealth,
            greed and lust. It was a tempestuous, sordid and soap-opera-ish
            Technicolored tale about an unhappy   
            declining, and self-destructive rich oil family in 1950s Texas. Under
            the title credits, weak, alcoholic, gun-loving Texas millionaire,
            oil heir and playboy Kyle Hadley (Oscar-nominated Robert Stack) was
            driving in an open sports-car while
            opening a bottle of alcohol with his teeth and swigging from it.
            After a murder sequence at the Hadley mansion, the film was told
            in flashback, moving from 1956 to 1955, signified
            by pages of a desk calendar blowing backward in time in the wind.
            As  the ne'er-do-well son of Texas dynasty
            magnate Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith), Kyle had impulsively and recently
            married (with an elopement) a beautiful, level-headed NY ad agency
            executive secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) who had been working
            on a Hadley Oil Company ad campaign. Kyle's sister Marylee (Oscar-winning
            Dorothy Malone) was portrayed as jealous, promiscuous, unstable and
            nymphomaniacal - she even confirmed that she was a tramp: &quot;I'm
            filthy, period!&quot; Marylee
            became infatuated with Kyle's best friend - handsome, successful,
            oil company geologist Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), and offered herself
            to the unattainable Mitch while riding in a car with him:
          &quot;Do you love me, Mitch?... I don't want you as a brother...I'll
          wait, and I'll have you, marriage or no marriage.&quot; Kyle became
          suspicious of Mitch who had  
        affection for Lucy - but only platonic. Kyle was stunned by a doctor's
          report (in a coffee shop/drugstore) that he was near-sterile with a
          low sperm count - afterwards, he walked outside and viewed a young
          boy on a rocking horse! Lucy expressed her concerns about her
          husband Kyle's heavy drinking to elder patriarch Jasper Hadley. She
          claimed that he was showing signs of personal demons, and becoming
          abusive, although he was unwilling to divulge the source of his torment.
          Kyle had returned to drinking after his devastating diagnosis; after
          seeing Kyle's return to degeneracy, his father Jasper told Mitch how
          he blamed himself for his children's short-comings. 
          The lustful Marylee performed a provocative and
          very sexual mambo 'death' dance (dressed in a full-length, orchid pink
          negligee) in her bedroom (with a picture of Mitch in her arms) - symbolically
          intercut with Jasper Hadley having a heart attack and toppling down
          the full length of the Hadley mansion's spiral-curved staircase to
          his death. Afterwards, Marylee also fueled Kyle's
          anxious jealousy, suspicions of his own sterility, and urged his habitual
          bout with a bottle by lying about Lucy and her alleged affair with
          his best friend Mitch. The self-hating and suicidal
            Kyle manufactured mad and insane suspicions that Mitch and his wife
            Lucy were having an affair - he made a vicious attack upon Lucy when
            she became pregnant. He wrongly accused her of having been impregnated
          by Mitch. In the unfortunate altercation, Lucy miscarried. Roaring
          drunk, Kyle returned home and held Mitch at gunpoint while screaming
          at him about his betrayal; Kyle condemned Mitch for his past wrong-doings
          - stealing the love of his father, sister, and wife!; Mitch stoically
          denied any sexual involvement with Lucy, but couldn't convince Kyle
          otherwise ((&quot;I never touched Lucy, only because she's your wife&quot;);
          he then informed Kyle about his lost child: (&quot;Get this straight.
          The child would have been yours. Not mine. Yours&quot;). Incensed,
          the abject Kyle again screamed &quot;lousy white trash&quot; and aimed
          the gun at Mitch to murder him, as Marylee lunged forward and struggled
          with him for the weapon; the gun accidentally fired and struck Kyle
          in his midsection. In the concluding scenes of
          the courtroom inquest into Kyle's death (and the question of Mitch's
          guilt or innocence), Marylee's testimony held Mitch's life in the balance.
          First, she blamed Mitch for Kyle's death, but then she told the truth
          about Mitch's pure intentions toward Kyle: &quot;...he
            was worried about Kyle - as a brother for a brother.&quot; She concluded
            (the film's final line of dialogue) with words about her brother: &quot;He
            was sad -- the saddest of us all. He needed so much and had so little.&quot; In
            the film's ending, Mitch and Lucy departed from the mansion; left
            alone in her father's office-study, Marylee (wearing a business suit)
            mimicked her father's pose (in front of his painted portrait) at
            her father's desk, as she clutched, caressed/fondled (with both hands)
            and smiled at the miniature bronze model of an oil rig derrick -
            a small, erect symbol of power, wealth, and comfort - it was a very
            striking, final sexually-phallic image. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Wrong Man (1956)</strong>, 105 minutes,
              D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
              In this stark, film-noirish, documentary-styled crime drama, Stork
              Club string bass player and devoted family man Christopher Emanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Balestrero
              (Henry Fonda), living in the Jackson Heights (Queens) neighborhood
              of New York City, was mistakenly identified as a suspect for robberies
              (at gunpoint) at the Associated Life Insurance Company office -
              and police arrested him. He had visited the office to obtain a
              loan from wife Rose's (Vera Miles) policy, to pay for her expensive
              dental work. Detained and held for intense questioning for armed
              robbery without a lawyer (Manny called the grilling a &quot;meatgrinder&quot;),
              unusual coincidences caused police to believe that he was responsible
              for a string of robberies. The innocent 'everyman' Manny protested
              the charges, claiming he was &quot;the wrong man.&quot; After being
              bailed out for $7,500 after a night in jail, inexperienced criminal
              attorney Frank D. O'Connor (Anthony Quayle) was hired to defend
              Manny. His alibi was that he was at a resort hotel with Rose during
              one of the robberies, but it couldn't be substantiated. Due to
              the stress of the case, Rose fell into depression, became totally
          apathetic, and was institutionalized in a mental hospital. 
		  During the trial, Manny was convincingly
              prosecuted, although it was judged a mistrial due to a juror's
              remarks. Meanwhile, the real robber was caught - his face closely
              resembled Manny's. The case was dismissed. In the film's epilogue,
              Rose was eventually cured two years later, and the couple moved
          to Florida. </font></p>        </td>
