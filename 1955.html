          <p><font size="2"><strong>All That Heaven Allows (1955)</strong>, 89
              minutes, D: Douglas Sirk<br />
              Director Douglas Sirk's melodramatic, glossy Technicolored soap
              opera was about a doomed May-December relationship in the conservative
              Eisenhower Era of the mid-1950s, in the confining and artificially-proper
              society of a suburban town (Stoningham) in New England. During
               the opening title credits, there was a symbolic, high-angle camera
              shot of a piercing, stiff spire of a New England church rising
              above the 'ideal' Americana town. Fortyish, middle-class, affluent
              widowed Cary Scott (Jane Wyman) (with her children away except
              on weekends) was being urged by her well-meaning neighbor Sara
              Warren (Agnes Moorehead) to socially date and find 'formal' companionship,
              possibly with an older, prosperous but uninteresting country
              club member named Harvey (Conrad Nagel), a stable but hypochondriac
            bachelor. Meanwhile, Cary began to establish a strong friendship
                  with her handsome, self-assured and calm, younger, back-to-nature,
                  self-reliant, non-conformist gardener Ron Kirby (Rock Hudson)
                  - their relationship, considered increasingly troubling because
                  of his blue-collar status, became the scandalizing subject
              of snobby, judgmental, upper-crust gossip mongerers in town, led
          by Mona Plash (Jacqueline de Wit). In
          an early discussion, Cary's bookish, social-worker daughter Kay (Gloria
          Talbott) talked about the &quot;old Egyptian
                  custom&quot; of entombing widows: &quot;Of walling up the widow
                  alive in the funeral chamber of her dead husband along with
                  all of his other possessions. The theory being that she was
                  a possession too, so she was supposed to journey into death
                  with him. And the community saw to it that she did. Course
                  that doesn't happen anymore&quot; - although Cary retorted:
          &quot;Doesn't it? Well, perhaps not in Egypt.&quot; Cary's relationship
          with Ron intensified after she visited at his rustic greenhouse cabin,
          viewed his silver-tipped spruce trees - and fell into his arms for
          an unexpected kiss. Later, she also  met some of his uninhibited,
          non-conformist friends, including ex-suburbanites Mick and Alida
          Anderson (Charles Drake and Virginia Grey) at a joyful party at their
          house. She learned they had sought to follow Henry David Thoreau's
          advice to be out of step with society and live off the land. Gossip
          surrounding Cary's and Ron's relationship included two falsehoods -
          that they had been romantically involved before her husband died, and
          that he was only interested in her money. Cary's two grown children
          also disapproved of the idea of their mother's new relationship with
          someone 'beneath' her. At a country club cocktail party, Cary and Ron
          were subjected to snide comments (Ron was called &quot;nature
          boy&quot;), snubs, stares, and unwelcome advances from married
          member Howard Hoffer (Donald Curtis) who tried to passionately
          kiss her - implying that she was a tease. In a
          decisive scene, Cary suggested to Ron that they suspend their love
          affair (and his proposal to get married) due to repressive community
          pressure and ostracizing (about her socially unacceptable choice):
            &quot;Ron, we're gonna have to wait to get married. Well... to
            give the children a chance to get used to the idea. They'll
            feel differently when they know you better....I'm just asking you
            to be patient. It's only a question of time....Right now everybody's
            talking about us - we're a local sensation. And like Sara said,
            if the people get used to seeing us together, then maybe they'll
            accept us...It's only for a little while, and it would make
            things so much easier.&quot; Ron was resistant
            to her suggestion about having their lives ruled by others: &quot;I'm
            sorry Cary, but it wouldn't work. I can't live that way. You knew
            that from the beginning....God knows I love you, but I won't let
            Ned nor Kay nor anyone else run our lives. Cary, don't you see we
            could never be happy if we did?...Cary, you're the one that made
            it a question of choosing. So you're the one that'll have to choose&quot; -
            she made a quick decision and chose her need for social acceptance
            over her love for him: &quot;All right. It's all over.&quot; Later
            in a related scene to the one earlier about Egyptian customs, there
            was a paired metaphoric shot of Cary appearing isolated, 'entombed'
            and trapped inside her house as she looked out of her window at Christmas
            festivities. Shortly later, a despondent Cary (suffering from
                recurring headaches) was presented with a Christmas gift from
                her grown children, self-centered and stuffy Princeton student
                Ned (William Reynolds) and Kay - an ironic consolation prize
                and substitute for having lost the love of her life, and to keep
                her company; both of her children would soon be leaving her life:
                Kay was engaged to be married, and Ned was going to study and
            work abroad in Paris.  The gift her children
            had given her was a brand new table-model TV set (adorned with red
            ribbons) - it was chosen to keep her company - she saw her chilling,
            solitary glassy reflection framed (enclosed and trapped) on the blank
            and empty TV screen as the salesman pointed at it and told her: &quot;All
            you have to do is turn that dial and you have all the company you
            want right there on the screen - drama, comedy, life's parade at
            your fingertips.&quot; By film's end, Cary and Ron were ultimately
            reconciled and brought back together when Cary visited Ron again
            at his house - an old mill that he had converted into a home for
            them. But when she approached the door, she hesitated and hurriedly
                  drove off. From a distance, Ron (who was out hunting) saw her
                  and rushed to call to her, but slipped on snow and fell over
          a cliff - and suffered a severe head concussion. Later
          that night, Cary was told by Alida that Ron was unconscious after an
          accident and she was driven to his cabin. While she waited for Ron
          to regain consciousness, she admired the beauty of his home that he
          had built for her and decided to no longer run away. The next morning
          when he woke up, he saw her and assuringly told her: &quot;You've come
          home&quot; - and she responded: &quot;Yes, darling, I've-I've come
          home.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Artists and Models (1955)</b>, 109 minutes, D: Frank
            Tashlin<br />
            Director Frank Tashlin's musical romantic comedy 
            <i>Artists and Models</i> was  the first of two Martin and Lewis
          films that he directed (the second was the duo's final film <i>Hollywood
            or Bust (1956)</i>, and it was the comedy duo's 14th feature film.
            One of Dean Martin's signature songs,  &quot;Innamorata&quot;          was
            featured in this film. In the opening sequence, 
            struggling painter and aspiring artist Richard &quot;Rick&quot; Todd
            (Dean Martin) was promptly fired from his job
            as he was painting the bright red lips of an open-mouthed female
            on a gigantic 'smoking' billboard. He blamed his geeky best friend
          and goofy roommate Eugene Fullstack (Jerry Lewis),
          who was serving as his work assistant. Eugene was an aspiring children's
          book writer-author  who became distracted
          on the job due to his avid and crazed obsession with reading 'Bat
          Lady' comic books, and was responsible for their firing.  
          In their shared 3rd floor apartment in a Greenwich Village building,
          they were soon perusing the want ads for employment. Infantile-minded
            Eugene often lived in a fantasy, &quot;make-believe&quot; world (to
            shield him from real-life). During the night in their shared bedroom,
            Rick was awakened by Eugene's screamed, fantastical babblings and
            sleep-talking
          &quot;bad dream&quot; rants. Eugene's fully-developed and highly-charged,
          comic-book fantasy story-plots in his dreams were about a garishly-costumed,
              bird-like interplanetary space superhero and feathered adventurer
          known as &quot;Vincent the Vulture&quot; who fought off a diabolical
          female opponent with three purple-colored eyes known as &quot;Zuba
          the Magnificent.&quot; Zuba was armed with fangs and a lethal &quot;atomic
          atomizing pivot gun&quot; to
          steal Vincent's &quot;secret power formula: X34 minus 5r1 plus 6-x36.&quot;  Two
          roommate-tenants on the 4th floor directly above them were successful,
          pretty blonde, professional comic artist-cartoonist Abigail 'Abby'
          Parker (Dorothy Malone) who illustrated the 'Bat Lady' comics,
          and her 'Bat Lady' model Bessie Sparrowbrush (Shirley MacLaine). Eugene's
          first view of the  'Bat Lady' in costume caused him to
          develop an infatuation with the superheroine. At the same time, 
          the horoscope-obsessed Bessie told Abby that she had just met her
          true love (Eugene), due to her promising astrological readings. In
          the office of Abby's comic book and pulp editor-publisher boss Mr.
          Murdock (Eddie Mayehoff), she promptly quit her job when she refused
          to comply with Murdock's mercenary demands for more violence and bloody
          gore in the stories. In the outer office where Bessie was working as
          Murdock's secretary, she  realized that Eugene was love-struck
          with her 'Bat-Lady' persona. After Abigail's firing, Rick saw an opportunity
          to be hired as Murdock's new comic-book artist and author, and he secretly
          accepted the job while continuing to romance Abby, and pressure her
          to hire him as a male model for an advertising
          layout. Without Eugene's or Abby's knowledge,
           Rick accepted the job offer from Murdock and proposed Eugene's
          dreamt-up character 'Vincent the Vulture' as the new story-line.
          He planned on using the violent plots of Eugene's nightmares as his
          subject matter - to fit the increasing demand for gore. Meanwhile,
          story-writer Eugene and illustrator Abby collaborated together on his
          children's books (about 'Goose and Fieldmouse'), while each night,
          Rick took advantage of Eugene by transcribing his violent nightmares
          and dream-stories, and submitting the material as his own work for
          a new comic-book series known as 'Vincent The Vulture' for Murdock.
          The first published 'Vincent the Vulture' comics, with a secret mathematical
          rocket fuel formula (a national secret) in the plot, were extremely
          popular with young fans; however, in the current Cold War era, the
          military feared that their rocket fuel formula was being made available
          to the Soviets. The Russians deployed their own secret weapon -- seductive
          foreign Agent Sonia/Mrs. Curtis (Eva Gabor) to entice Rick (and then
          Eugene) to reveal the entire secret formula. The FBI, Secret Service
          and NYPD became involved to prevent the Soviets from conducting their
          spy activities. The film concluded with a marvelous musical 
		  production number (&quot;Artists and Models&quot;)
          performed on the set of a gigantic artist's painting palette. During
		  the Ball, Sonia and her spy gang abducted Bessie and stole her clothes in
		  order to impersonate her and dress in her costume, to enticingly kidnap
               Eugene and take him to the
              Soviets' hideout-mansion (Sonia's &quot;love nest&quot;). At the
              spies' locale, Eugene was drugged with doctored champagne, went
              into his dream-land, and was about to recite the complete secret
              formula. He was rescued by Rick and a recently-freed Bessie who
              had followed them in a taxi. Eugene was brought to life and powerfully
              re-energized by Bessie's true-love kiss and was able to vanquish
              all of the spies (and also some of the members of the Secret Service
              and NYPD) by knocking them out with potent punches. Eugene finally
              realized that Bessie was his true 'Bat Lady' love from his dreams.
              They hurriedly returned to the stage of the Artists and Models
              Ball - where the two reunited couples sang: &quot;There always
              comes a time for wedding bells to chime.&quot; Eugene pointed to
              Abby next to Rick: &quot;She's his!&quot;, while Bessie asserted
              to Eugene: &quot;You're mine!&quot;  They miraculously transformed
              into wearing marital clothes for a double wedding as they sang
              the final line of the song: &quot;When You Pretend&quot;: &quot;For
              life is filled with happy endings when you pretend.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: John Sturges<br />
            Director John Sturges' suspenseful, powerful,
            50's Western-like drama and modern-day film-noirish mystery-thriller,
            a masterpiece about racial prejudice (and a harsh comment about Hollywood's
            blacklist and the McCarthy years), was set in an isolated, southwestern
            desert town in 1945 - scriptwriter Millard Kaufman based the film
            adaptation upon American novelist Howard Breslin's late 1946 short
            story &quot;Bad Time at Honda&quot; first
            published in <i>The American Magazine (January 1947)</i>. In
            the stunning opening credits sequence - the <i>Streamliner</i> diesel
            train raced across the arid desert before making an unusual stop
            at Black Rock, AZ's train station - the first time the train
            had ever stopped in the tiny isolated town in four years. A  well-dressed,
            mysterious one-armed stranger named John J. Macreedy (Spencer Tracy)
            entered into the hostile, uncooperative, and claustrophobic Western
            town, and quickly realized he was unwelcome by the few citizens found
            there. He had come to fulfill his civic responsibility and a personal promise that he had made
            to a Japanese-American soldier who died fighting in WW II. He was
            searching for the whereabouts of the local Japanese-American father,
            Komoko, of his soldier/friend Joe who had saved his life during the
            war in Italy, to bestow the deceased man's posthumously-presented
            medal of honor to the family. After encountering mostly a conspiracy
            of silence, he learned that the farmer Komoko had died after facing
            internment by the US government. Macreedy rented a jeep and drove
            to nearby Adobe Flat to locate the Japanese family's leased homestead,
            and found evidence that it had burned to the ground. He began to
            suspect that a deadly incident four years earlier had occurred -
            the murder of Komoko at his homestead by prejudiced townsfolk. His
            awkward questions caused the uneasy, hostile local inhabitants to
            confront their guilty consciences and threaten his life, led by menacing,
            sinister town boss Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) and his henchmen - a
            racially-bigoted Coley Trimble (Ernest Borgnine) and sadistic bully
            Hector David (Lee Marvin). They retaliated
            with violence and set him up to be killed as he tried to escape from
            their conspiracy, putting his life at risk. Eventually, some town
            members, including a drunken Sheriff Tim Horn (Dean Jagger),  a vet/doctor
            and undertaker Doc Velie (Walter Brennan), and Liz Wirth (Anne
            Francis) became the stranger's allies. In the fiery conclusion, Liz
            was shot in the back by Reno Smith to silence her, infuriating Macreedy
            who inventively created  a  Molotov cocktail that he tossed
            at Reno to incinerate him. As Macreedy prepared to leave Black Rock
            and the Streamliner's horn was heard in the distance, Doc asked him
            to give Komoko's medal to the whole town to remind the people of
            the cowardly conspiracy that nearly destroyed them, so that it might
            not happen again.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Big Knife (1955),</b> 111 minutes, D: Robert
              Aldrich<br />
          Director Robert Aldrich's cynical and depressing screen adaptation
          (by James Poe) of Clifford Odets' 1949 Broadway stage play (directed
          by Lee Strasberg, and starring John Garfield) was a dark and film noirish,
          over-the-top look at Hollywood's corrosive and ruthless search for
          fame and power. The dense plot was revealed through Odets' rich, verbose
          and abstract dialogue. Its themes also included infidelity, corruption,
          betrayal, and criminal cover-up of murder. Aldrich's deep-focus cinematography,
          canted angles, and extreme close-ups accentuated the claustrophobic
          setting - mostly within the living room of a Bel-Air mansion populated
          by a parade of characters who confronted a nerve-addled, tormented,
          and unhinged Hollywood actor. The crime-melodrama told the overheated
          story of actor Charles 'Charlie' Castle (Jack Palance) - a philanderer
          and drinker who was struggling and at a personal crossroads with his
             life, due to his estrangement from his idealistic wife Marion (Ida
            Lupino in her last great screen role), his own complete psychological
            and moral collapse, his suffocating career as an actor in bad and
            exploitative films, and the blackmailing control exercised over him
            by  his vulgar, explosive studio boss Stanley Hoff (an over-the-top
          Rod Steiger) in the Hollywood machine that forced him to continue making
          compromising, soul-crushing movies. In his Bel-mansion, narcissistic
          actor Charlie Castle  faced a downhill slide. He had &quot;sold
          out his dreams&quot; by appearing in lesser B-movies, and by working
          under the machinations of an oppressive, vicious and amoral studio
          system. Acidic gossip columnist Patty Benedict (Ilka Chase) was  looking
          for a juicy scandal and details about rumors that she had heard, that
          Charlie and his wife were on the verge of filing for divorce. She revealed
          her knowledge of a previous studio scandal that involved Charlie's
          friend and studio publicist Buddy Bliss (Paul Langton), who was rehired
          after serving 10 months in jail; she asked why Buddy had been kept
          on the payroll (although he served 10 months in prison for a DUI and
          hit-and-run accident caused by Charlie), and hinted that she threatened
          to dig up more dirt on Charlie's past life about the incident. This
          covered-up scandal overshadowed Charlie's entire life and career. Charlie's
          idealistic, estranged wife Marion (Ida Lupino) had moved out of their
          Bel Air home to a beach home with their young son Billy (Michael Winkelman);
               she was entirely aware of his infidelities
              with floozies (&quot;occasional girls&quot;) and wished that he
              would become more committed to her and their marriage. She wondered
              if he had signed the renewal on his iron-clad 7-year studio contract,
              and if he was going to continue to have a profligate lifestyle
              of drinking and womanizing. She mentioned that their mutual writer-friend
              and studio scriptwriter Horatio 'Hank' Teagle (Wesley Addy) had
              already boldly proposed marriage to her, and was leaving for NYC
              in a few weeks. Marion's most definitive statement was her threat
              to leave Charlie <i>permanently</i> if he signed
              his renewal contract, and continued his downward spiral in life.
              Charlie insisted to his kindly and compassionate but spineless
              agent Nat Danziger (Everett Sloane) that he would not be signing
              his contract, but Nat was more concerned what the blackmailing
              studio boss would do if Charlie tore up the contract and moved
              away. Charlie's domineering, bear-like, tyrannical,
              white-crew-cutted studio boss Stanley Shriner Hoff (Rod Steiger)
              and his slimy, bland, and obsequious lawyer-assistant Smiley Coy
              (Wendell Corey) arrived to pressure their &quot;property&quot; to
              reluctantly sign and renew his contract for a term of 7 more years.
              Ultimately, after Charlie was reminded of the murderous Faustian
              deal that had saved Castle's career (involving his covered-up DUI
              hit-and-run accident that killed a child, by having Buddy serve
              a 10-month prison sentence in his stead), Charlie reluctantly signed
              the contract. Charlie continued his sleazy lifestyle with an extra-marital
              affair with Buddy's alcoholic wife Mrs. Connie Bliss (Jean Hagen),
              although he was informed that Marion was set to see a divorce lawyer.
              Under studio duress, Charlie also entertained one of the studio's
              lesser starlets - an overtalkative, drunken Dixie Evans (Shelley
              Winters) who was becoming a problem for the studio - she threatened
              to talk about the studio's cover-up and how she was a passenger
              in the car Charlie was driving the night of the accident. Meanwhile,
              Charlie was working out his relationship with Marion, and pledged
              his love and devotion to her. During a second confrontation with
              Hoff and Smiley in his home, Charlie resisted pressuring ploys
              by them to help conduct Dixie's murder, and suggestions to divorce
              his wife and marry Dixie to keep her quiet. There would be fateful
              consequences due to Charlie's resistance to the studio, and his
              refusal to do the studio's bidding. As Charlie and Marion were
              finally beginning to reestablish their relationship,  Smiley arrived
              with news that Dixie had conveniently been run over by a city bus,
              and he phoned Hoff to notify him. Charlie, who was upset by Dixie's
              predicament (did he overhear Smiley's phone call?), committed suicide
              in a hot bath in his upstairs bathroom by slashing his wrists (off-screen).
              Opportunistic Smiley's falsified report
              to the press about Charlie's 'heart-attack' and
              friendship with Hoff was stymied by Hank, who proposed to tell
              the real truth of Charlie's death without it being spoiled by the
              studio. The film concluded with the bewildered Marion repeatedly
              calling out: &quot;Help! Help! Help!...&quot; </font></p></td>

              D: Richard Brooks<br />
              Co-writer/diirector Richard Brooks' and MGM's shocking, cautionary
              tale, urban melo-drama and striking film with social commentary
              was about the state of education in a violent, crime-ridden inner-city
              US boys school (the &quot;blackboard jungle&quot;). It was the
              first American film to deal with the social problem of teenage
              delinquency and classroom anarchy in our urban public schools.
              It was also notable as the first film to feature a rock-'n'-roll
              song in its soundtrack,
		   &quot;Rock-Around-The-Clock.&quot; (sung by Bill Haley and His Comets during
        the opening title credits). Idealistic, soft-spoken,
              middle-aged US Navy war veteran Richard Dadier (Glenn Ford) was
		   one of three new school teachers hired
              to work (as an English teacher) in a slum, inter-racial and multi-ethnic
		   inner-city boys vocational school (North Manual Trades High School)
		   in NYC. The school's principal Mr. Warneke (John Hoyt) decisively
		   asserted a questionable statement: &quot;There is no discipline problem
		   in this school.&quot; One
		   experienced, cynical teacher Mr. Jim Murdock (Louis Calhern) described
		   the school:  &quot;This
        is the garbage can of the educational system.&quot; Dadier  was also
        dealing with his 4-months pregnant wife Anne (Anne Francis), who was
        moody and tense about miscarrying. Immediately at school in his classroom,
        Dadier faced delinquent, tough-talking, lower-class student misbehavior.
        Two students in particular who stood out were disaffected, inner-city
        black youth Gregory Miller (Sidney Poitier in one of his earliest roles),
        and unruly, insolent, disrespectful, bullying, rebellious and brash gang-leader
        Artie West (Vic Morrow). Dadier asked for Miller's help to guide the
        students into becoming more cooperative, but Miller refused. Troubling
        incidents occurred in rapid succession: pretty new teacher Lois Hammond
        (Margaret Hayes) was sexually assaulted in the library, and Dadier and
        another teacher, Josh Edwards (Richard Kiley) were brutally mugged and
        assaulted by Artie West and other gang members in an alleyway. The headstrong
        and stubborn Dadier steadfastly vowed to his wife Anne: &quot;I'm not
        beaten, and I'm not quittin',&quot; but he also
         felt like he had lost his ideals about why he wanted to teach. The Principal
        also falsely  accused Dadier of being &quot;guilty of racial
        prejudice&quot; and bigoted thinking in his classroom. Jazz music-loving
        Mr. Edwards was attacked in his classroom and his priceless record collection
        was destroyed by Arte West. Soon after, Edwards resigned. Meanwhile,
        Anne was receiving anonymous letters and phone calls accusing her husband
        of cheating on her with Miss Hammond. The stress  of the letters and
        phone calls about a possible affair led to Anne's &quot;mentally-disturbed&quot;
        state and her unexpected labor and delivery of a premature baby
        boy. Dadier learned about the letters and phone calls and felt
               completely defeated by the school and his students, and  
               considered resigning. Things came to a head when Dadier confronted
               two of his students for cheating.  Arte refused to turn in his
               plagiarized paper, and when  Dadier  prepared to take him to the
               Principal's office, the confrontation escalated, and Arte drew
               his switchblade and kept threatening Dadier with violence. Dadier
               was struck in the hand and bloodied, but remarkably was backed
               up by Miller and other classmates. Arte West's domination of the
               class and his gang was finally over. (Arte was the one who had
               accused him of racial bigotry and had sent the accusatory letters
               and made the phone calls.) In the final scene, Miller made a deal
               with Dadier that they both wouldn't quit the school prematurely,
               since Miller had heard rumors that Dadier was planning on quitting.
               They both agreed to honor their earlier pact to not leave early.
        The film ended with a reprise of &quot;Rock-Around-The-Clock.&quot; </font></p></td>

            Frank and Norman Panama</font><br />
            <font size="2">Co-directors Melvin Frank's and Norman Panama's
            classic musical costume comedy, a spoof of adventure-film swashbucklers,
            was set in medieval England. Danny Kaye starred in a dual role as
            carnival entertainer-acrobat Hubert Hawkins, and as an impersonator
            of a court jester named &quot;Giacomo&quot;
            (pronounced &quot;Jockamo&quot;). In the plot, King Roderick  (Cecil
              Parker) had
            usurped the throne by murdering the royal family, but a royal baby
             (with a purple pimpernel birthmark on his bottom) - the rightful
            heir to the throne, had survived the massacre ordered by the King's
            evil right-hand man Sir Ravenhurst (Cecil Rathbone). The baby was
            being protected by a group of rebel loyalists led by dashing, Robin
            Hood-like outlaw &quot;The
            Black Fox&quot;  (Edward Ashley)
            and his followers in the forest. To solidify his power,  the King
             was pressuring his pretty daughter
            - Princess Gwendolyn (Angela Lansbury) - into a politically-important
            marriage to Sir Griswold of the North (Robert Middleton). Two of
            the Black Fox's followers, ex-carnival entertainer Hubert Hawkins
            (Danny Kaye) and Maid/Captain Jean (Glynis Johns), disguised themselves
            as wine merchants and were entrusted with the royal baby, to whisk
            it away to an Abbey for safety. Along the way toward the King's palace,
            the two met a court jester from Italy named
            Giacomo (John Carradine) who had been recommended by
            Ravenhurst to the king. Giacomo - a skilled
            assassin, was part of Ravenhurst's conspiracy to eliminate the King
            and assume power for himself. After they rendered him unconscious,
            Hawkins decided to impersonate the 'Court Jester' as part of their
            plan to infiltrate into the King's castle (and acquire a secret key
            in the King's chambers that would open up a secret tunnel passageway
            into the castle that would allow the Black Fox to invade). Jean was
            kidnapped by the King's men and taken as a wench for the King's pleasure,
            while Hawkins continued on as &quot;Giacomo&quot; - not knowing that
            he was supposed to be an assassin. Efforts to keep the baby hidden
            in a basket prevailed, with help from a rebel confederate on the
            inside - the castle's stableman Fergus (Noel Drayton). At the castle,
            Princess Gwendolyn voiced repeated rejections to her father's demands
            for a forced marriage and alliance to Griswold. She convinced her
            witch-maid Griselda (Mildred Natwick) to help her out - and a spell
            was cast on &quot;Giacomo&quot; to become
            a dashing lover who could convincingly woo the Princess. Throughout
            the film, the hypnotizing spell could easily be removed and reinstated
            with the snap of the fingers. Once Griswold arrived, Gwendolyn declared
            her love for &quot;Giacomo&quot; instead. To avenge his insulted
            and destroyed honor, Griswold challenged &quot;Giacomo&quot; to a
            jousting-challenge to the death. To ensure that &quot;Giacomo&quot; would
            win the joust with Griswold, Griselda poisoned one of the drinks
            for the pre-joust toast - leading to the film's most memorable, tongue-twisting
            scenes about identifying where the poison was located. Although the
            pre-joust poisonous toast was called off at the last minute, the
            duel-challenge proceeded. It was won by &quot;Giacomo&quot; after
            a freak lightning strike magnetized his body suit of armor. The King
            reluctantly declared &quot;Giacomo&quot; the
          winner (of the contest and of his daughter) after he spared Griswold's
          life, but Ravenhurst accused &quot;Giacomo&quot;
          of being a traitor and ordered him to be arrested with Jean (&quot;his
          foul accomplice&quot;) to both face a trial. Meanwhile, Hawkins'
          army of &quot;little people&quot; were infiltrating into the passageway
          leading to the castle's palace, while the Black Fox led his own army
          toward the castle. The army of midgets led by Hawkins took control
          of the basket holding the royal child, rescued Jean, attacked and knocked
          out the King's guards and catapulted them into the castle's moat,
          as the Black Fox's forces arrived with reinforcements. A hypnotized &quot;Giacomo&quot; (believing
          that he was a confident and skilled swordsman) dueled against and
          defeated Sir Ravenhurst, by catapulting him into the castle's moat.
          The film concluded with the defeat and ouster of throne-usurper King
          Roderick, and the revelation of the true young King (with the purple
          pimpernel birthmark) to Sir Griswold and his army.</font> </p>        </td>

          <p><b><font size="2">The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955)</font></b><font size="2">,
            100 minutes, D: Otto Preminger </font><br />
            <font size="2">This biographical (biopic) war docu-drama, a true
            story (although containing a number of fictionalized elements), was
            set in the mid-1920s. Stubborn but dedicated military airman Gen.
            William
            &quot;Billy&quot; Mitchell (Gary Cooper), a WWI hero,
            was a prophetic visionary who proposed the expansion of airpower
            during future military combat, but his crusading recommendations
            to the US War Department were continually overlooked and ignored.
            With his aircraft expertise and uncompromising nature, he  argued
            for better aircraft maintenance, and the upgrading the fleet of airplanes
            left over from WWI. To make a firm political statement, in July of
            1921, he deliberately violated military rules during a test of aircraft
            at an army test site off the coast of Virginia by using heavier bombs
            (above the 1,000 pound limit) and flying at a lower altitude of 2,000
            feet (below the 5,000 foot required level). He proved his statement
            that battleships could be neutralized during war with air power by
            sinking the ex-German World War I battleship <i>Ostfriesland</i>.
            However, he was  reprimanded
            for his disobedience. In 1925, he was demoted to Colonel and sent
            to a clerical army post in Fort Sam Houston (San Antonio, Texas).
            Meanwhile, outdated planes were continually crashing (six aircraft
            crashed on their way from California to Arizona), and Mitchell lost
            some of his closest friends, including   
            Lt. Cmdr. Zachary
            &quot;Zack&quot; Lansdowne (Jack Lord) and 13 other crew members
            who died in a senseless
            tragedy over Ohio during a 27-city publicity junket on the <i>USS
            Shenandoah</i> airship-dirigible.
            To publicize the problem and complain, Mitchell lobbied for
            a press conference, and accused the Navy and War Departments of criminal
            negligence, incompetence and treasonous administration. Predictably,
            he was court-martialed. The &quot;Court-Martial&quot; Trial touted in the film's
            title began at the 70 minute mark of the 100 minute-long film. Illinois
            Congressman Frank Reid (Ralph Bellamy) and military-appointed attorney
            Lt. Colonel White (James Daly) defended Mitchell, while the prosecutor
            was Colonel Moreland (Fred Clark), and the presiding judge was Maj.
            Gen. James Guthrie (Charles Bickford). None of the military officers
            involved in the case had Air Corps experience. Court-martialed Mitchell
            was tried for breaking Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of
            Military Justice: conduct unbecoming an officer, and conduct that
            discredited the military. Reid was stymied when his requests to call
            witnesses to speak on Mitchell's behalf were denied. He asked Mitchell
            to sign a paper to withdraw his criticisms in exchange for reestablishing
            himself as an Army officer, but he refused. Mitchell had definitely
            disobeyed the articles and his commanding officers, but questions
            were raised: why, and were his accusations justified? The hearing
            began to turn in Mitchell's favor when previously-denied witnesses
            were allowed to testify, including WWI ace Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker
            (Tom McKee), Major Carl Spaatz (Steve Roberts), Major H. H. Arnold
            (Robert Brubaker), and Congressman Fiorello LaGuardia (Phil Arnold)
            (the future mayor of NYC). Lansdowne's widow Margaret (Elizabeth
            Montgomery in her film debut) testified that her husband's aircraft
            was a death trap. When Mitchell took the stand, he was cross-examined
            by sharp special prosecutor Major Allen Guillion (Rod Steiger). While
            also suffering from a malaria attack, he stood up to the nasty, skilled
            prosecutor, arguing that with the current state of the Air-Force,
            the US Navy at Pearl Harbor could easily be attacked
            (as it was years later). At the conclusion of the trial, Mitchell
            was convicted of insubordination, and suspended from active duty
        for five years without pay. </font></p>        </td>

                Diabolique, or The Devils)</strong>,
              114 minutes, D: Henri-Georges Clouzot<br />
              French director Henri-Georges Clouzot's intriguing, noirish psychological
              horror-thriller was one of the earliest films to feature a shocking
              plot twist in its conclusion. The overarching themes of 
			  the Hitchcockian, <a href="psyc.html"><i>Psycho</i></a>-like
              film were hate, double-cross, revenge
        and greed.  At the run-down, all-boys Institution Delassalle Boarding
              School in metropolitan Paris, a love triangle had developed between
              the three main characters:  34 year-old Michel
              Delassalle (Paul Meurisse) - a despicable, miserly, tyrannical
              and abusive schoolmaster who was cruelly mistreating his students
        and employees, his  tormented and
          &quot;delicate&quot; wife/Headmistress-Principal Christina &quot;CriCri&quot; Delassalle
          (V&eacute;ra Clouzot, director Georges Clouzot's real-life wife), a
          devout ex-Catholic nun originally from Caracas, Venezuela with a heart
        condition, and Michel's mistress - an icy cool-tempered, cropped blonde-haired
          school teacher named  Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret). Christina knew
        of her husband's destructive affair with Nicole, but tolerated it. Nicole
          was finally able to convince her co-battered friend Christina to join
          together with her to commit the perfect yet sinister murder of their
          equally-despised tormenter Michel. During a 3-day school vacation break
        that they took together to Nicole's country apartment, they lured Michel
          there with Christina's threat of a divorce. Christina tricked him 
          into drinking alcohol spiked with a sleep sedative before the two drowned
          him in the bathtub. Nicole held down Michel's drugged body as the horrified
        and more sensitive Christina stood by. The body was brought back to the
          school the next day in a large wicker trunk and dumped in the school's
          neglected swimming pool. The two females thought that the death would
          easily be ruled a suspected drowning once the body surfaced, but it
        didn't appear as expected.  The two uncertain and nervous co-conspirators
          began to distrust each other, assign blame and make recriminating statements,
        while becoming guilt-ridden, fearful, and worried. Other tense, semi-supernatural
          and unusual situations began to occur, suggesting that something had
        gone terribly awry with the murder, and that Michel might still be alive.
          A nosy, retired police commissioner and elderly, bumbling private detective
          Alfred Fichet (Charles Vanel) became involved in the case when
        he insisted that he could help Christina and locate her missing husband.
          In the film's plot-twisting conclusion, after wandering around the
          school building and her apartment and getting spooked by strange noises
        and shadows, in her bathroom, she unexpectedly found Michel's corpse
          in the bathtub. When Michel rose zombie-like
          out of a bathtub with half-opened, glazed all-white eyes, she experienced  a
              fright-induced heart attack. The major twist was that Michel was
          never killed by them - he had faked his own death - with collaborative
          help by Nicole - so that Christina could be induced into having a fatal
          heart attack. Nicole rushed
            into Michel's arms for embraces and kisses. Their plan had been to
          become rich by selling the &quot;fire-trap&quot; school that he would
          inherit from his deceased wife. The two gloating co-conspirators
        were <i>immediately</i> arrested by Alfred - who overheard them talking
        about their plotting, and predicted their prison term of 15-20 years.
        In the film's resolution the next day as the school was closing, the
        confused, truth-telling or lying (?) student Moinet (Yves-Marie Maurin),
        the same boy who had earlier broken a window and stated that he had seen
        the Principal, now declared that Christina had just given him back his
        confiscated slingshot which he had used to break a second window that
        morning. The film's last
        line as he walked away to again stand in a corner for punishment for lying was: &quot;I
        saw her. I know I saw her.&quot; (translated) The film's unique, one
        of the first of its kind, end-credits 'anti-spoilers' director's statement
        advised viewers to keep the film's ending a secret.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Elia Kazan<br />
            Director Elia Kazan's CinemaScopic drama was an updated re-telling
            of the Biblical story of rival brothers, Cain and Abel and a paradise
            lost. The maligned, misunderstood Cain character, representing the
            unlikeable and outcast director himself (for naming names before
            the HUAC Committee in 1952), became the sensitive hero of the film.
            One of the film's posters exclaimed: &quot;<em>East of Eden</em> is
            a story of explosive passions and Elia Kazan has made it into a picture
            of staggering power.&quot; Another poster described the relationship
            of the two brothers, by stating: &quot;Sometimes
            you can't tell who's good and who's bad!...&quot; Writer
          Paul Osborn's screenplay adapted John Steinbeck's 1952 novel with the
          same title for this dramatic Warner Bros. film. [Note: The film told
           only a small portion of Steinbeck's work, leaving out the childhood
          of the parents and the Chinese character of Lee.] The film's plot was
            set in 1917 at a time just before the US entry
            into World War I. It introduced the Trask family, ruled by a patriarchal
             father - stern, hardened, devoutly religious,
            self-righteous man  Adam Trask (Raymond Massey), a lettuce farmer
            living with his family in Salinas, CA. His two contrasting
             twin sons (modeled after the Biblical brothers Cain and Abel)  
             often vied for the affections of their father: (1) favored,
             dull, dutiful and stuffy Aron (Richard Davalos), and (2) underappreciated,
            insecure, tortured, neurotic loner Caleb &quot;Cal&quot; Trask (James
            Dean, in his first major role and film). The embittered Cal believed
            that he was the 'bad' son, and that his twin brother Aron 
             was the favored 'good' son. The plot
          became emotionally charged when Cal learned that
          his estranged mother, known as Kate (Jo Van Fleet), was actually alive
          and was serving as a brothel-Madame in nearby Monterey, CA. Adam admitted
          the revelation and said he had kept it a secret to &quot;save you pain&quot; -
          spreading the belief that she had died after her twin boys were born
          and she had moved East. During Cal's  second visit  to
          'Kate', he requested funds of $5,000  (to 'buy' his father's love and
          to invest it into a risky new bean crop). There were further issues
          that divided the brothers, when Cal expressed
          a liking for his brother's girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris). The most
          climactic scene was during Adam's birthday, when Cal's father rejected
          his gift of cash earnings from an investment in bean futures during
          the war years to help relieve his father's dour financial state. Cal
          was also harshly rebuked and threatened by Aron for associating with
          Abra. Cal retaliated by bringing Aron to
            see his mother (whom he had always been told was dead) - a whorehouse
          Madame engaged in a sinful profession. The shock of Aron's introduction
          to his mother caused him to get drunk and enlist in the army. Cal 
          dramatically confronted and revealed to his father on the porch
          - that he knew all about his mother and why their marriage broke up.
          He then admitted that he had taken Aron to see their mother.  In the
          emotional finale following Adam's stroke and paralysis,  Abra 
          explained to bed-ridden Adam why Cal had behaved like he did for not
          being loved in a fatherly way. Abra pleaded that Mr. Trask show some
          love to Cal.  In the conclusion, Cal sat by his father's bedside
            and ultimately reconciled with him. Adam managed to speak and asked
          Cal to stay with him and care for him, instead of the detested nurse.
          Cal told Abra the good news, and then Cal and Abra fully kissed 
		  for the first time as the film concluded.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>Guys and Dolls (1955)</strong>, 150 minutes,
              D: Joseph L. Mankiewicz<br />
              Samuel Goldwyn's production - 
              a crime-related musical, was developed from a 1933 short story
              titled &quot;The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown&quot; by writer Damon
              Runyon about a NY sharpster and a missionary girl, and was released
              by MGM in the mid-50s. It was the big screen version of the story
        adapted from the long-running 1950 Broadway musical play. In the Depression-Era
              in NYC, the plot was about two gangster/gamblers (&quot;guys&quot;) and the
               two females (&quot;dolls&quot;) who were involved with them. Broadway denizen
              and financially-challenged gambler Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra)
              was known for organizing and running &quot;The Oldest Established
        Permanent Floating Crap Game&quot; in the city, and was questing for
        a new venue to hold his gambling event, but was facing pressure and intense &quot;heat&quot; from
        NYPD Lieutenant Brannigan (Robert Keith). Nathan had been engaged for
        14 years to Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine), a headliner at the Hot Box
        Club, who was also pressuring him to finally get married and elope,
        and to quit his gambling enterprise and become a normal businessman.
        Nathan met with an old acquaintance at Mindy's Restaurant,  high-roller
        Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) and tricked him into wagering $1,000, so
        that he could pay a required cash deposit for the Biltmore Garage for
        his crap game. As part of the bet, Sky was required to date and romance/seduce
         Salvation Army-like missionary Sgt./Sister Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons)
        from the &quot;Save A Soul&quot; Mission - a prudish and ultra-religious individual
        who was against gambling. After meeting her, Sky promised he would give
        Sarah his marker (a written IOU pledge or guarantee) that he could recruit
        a dozen genuine sinners into her Broadway-branch Mission two days later
        for her Thursday-midnight prayer meeting, if she would accept a date
        - flying to Havana for dinner. Although she initially refused the deal,
        she changed her mind the next day when the Mission was threatened to
        be shutdown. During their brief time in Havana together, they fell in
        love with each other. When they returned, they discovered that Nathan
        had used her empty Mission for a crap game. Recriminations and accusations
        were made  that Sky had used Sarah, and she broke up with him. However,
        Sky kept his promise to her, to fill her Mission with genuine sinners,
        by making a risky bet with all the gamblers in town (including Chicago
        gangster Big Jule (B.S. Pully)). He proposed a bold, daring, risky,
            and all-or-nothing roll of the dice bet against Big Jule and the
              other gamblers - that a loss would mean that he would
              pay $1,000 dollars to each of the gamblers, but a win would immediately
              require all of them to attend Sarah's Thursday-night midnight prayer
        meeting. He won the bet, luckily, after singing &quot;Luck Be A Lady,&quot; and
        saved Sarah's mission from closure. She realized that he actually loved
        her - and the film concluded with preparations for a double-marriage
        in Times Square the next day between Nathan and Miss Adelaide, and Sky
        with Sarah.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>I'll Cry Tomorrow (1955),</b> 117 minutes, D:
              Daniel Mann</font><br />
              <font size="2">Director Daniel Mann's and
              MGM's dramatic and poignant musical biopic was about a showbiz
              singer/actress and Broadway star named Lillian Roth (Susan Hayward).
                Hayward had also already starred
              in an Oscar-nominated role as an alcoholic nightclub singer in <i>Smash
              Up - The Story of a Woman (1947)</i>, and &quot;I'll Cry Tomorrow&quot;              was
              Hayward's first singing role. The film's tagline was: &quot;She
              fell from fame to shame!&quot;
            The plot was based upon Lillian Roth's own forthright and courageous
            best-selling 1954 &quot;tell-all&quot; autobiographical account of
            her personal tragedies (including five marriages) and 16 years of
            struggles with alcoholism and mental illness. The film's title was
            derived from her determined stage mother's advice to her resistant,
            crying daughter: &quot;You got all day tomorrow to cry.&quot; 
            During the opening title credits, one of Lillian Roth's own quotes
            was displayed on a title card: &quot;My life
              was never my own - - it was charted before I was born. <i>Lillian
            Roth.</i>&quot; The film's opening was composed of scenes to illustrate
            young 8 year-old Lillian Roth's (Carole Ann Campbell) quick rise
          to stardom  on the stage and screen,  due
              to  constant pressure from her domineering &quot;stage mother&quot;
            Katie (Jo Van Fleet), who urged: &quot;There'll be Broadway plays
          and Hollywood. You'll be happy, successful, the best.&quot; Years
          later in a Paramount Pictures studio in Hollywood, the glamorous screen
            star Lillian Roth  (Oscar-nominated Susan
            Hayward) sang the jazzy number on stage: &quot;Sing, You Sinners&quot;  -
            during the filming of the pre-Code Hollywood musical comedy <i>Honey
              (1930)</i>, while her domineering  mother watched from off-stage.
              Lillian's critical, pushy, over-ambitious and controlling mother
              orchestrated her daughter's entire career to seek fame and success,
              and limited her romantic prospects with her childhood sweetheart
              and fiancee David Tredman (Ray Danton), an entertainment company
              lawyer from New York. As her agent, he had arranged for a Palace
              Theatre (Broadway) engagement and a national tour for Lillian.
              Katie now feared that David might jeopardize Lillian's ambitions
              and success due to the couple's desire to marry, settle down and
          raise a family. Shortly later after she went
           on-stage on opening night at the Palace to sing the number: &quot;When
            the Red, Red, Robin Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along,&quot; Lillian
             learned that David had died of an undisclosed illness (brain cancer?)
            in the hospital, and she became extremely despondent and grief-stricken.
            Although she continued on a national tour, Lillian remained upset
            and offered alcohol by her nurse Ellen (Virginia Gregg) to calm her
            and help her sleep. During a long period of recovery from paralyzing
            grief, Lillian descended into a pattern of drunkenness and alcohol
            abuse. After dating and getting drunk with immature aviation soldier-cadet
            Wallie (Don Taylor), a surprised Lillian (who had blacked out) was
            told that they had gotten married. Lillian's very short, year-long
            loveless marriage was mostly a drunken stupor between the two, and
            he had become fed up with being known as &quot;Mr. Lillian Roth.&quot; Two
             years later, she met and fell prey to manipulative, sadistic and
            fellow alcoholic Tony Bardeman (Richard Conte) from Los Angeles,
          who charmed her. At the same time, Lillian's mother arrived for a visit
          after having learned about Lillian's excessive drinking, and she warned: &quot;You're
          going to become an old-fashioned drunkard....Everybody is talking,
          the agents, the managers.&quot; Lillian realized that she had become
          a full-blown alcoholic and her life continued to revolve around the
          bottle. After becoming reacquainted, Tony promised Lillian that they
          could have a lifetime together of sobriety. He proposed marriage, and
          then deceived her into a loan of $5,000 for a business deal in Chicago.
          Lillian moved to California with Tony, and in a Los Angeles bar with
          the emotionally-abusive Tony, she confessed to him that her life had
          descended into ruin: (&quot;I'm
          what you call an adorable drunk... I'm no good&quot;). Their altercation
            led to a very public incident in the parking
          lot. As Lillian's life and career descended
          into ruin, she left Tony in the middle of the night, pawned her fur
            coat to obtain a drink, and eventually she ended up on LA's Skid
          Row. Realizing that she needed help, she contacted her
            mother (off-screen) to rescue her: (&quot;Katie, come and get me...take
          me home&quot;). Lillian returned to NYC to live
            in a tiny apartment with her mother for a brief time. In one of the
            film's most memorable sequences, they had a vicious argument together.
            The alcohol-addicted Lillian blamed her mother for deliberately breaking
          an alcohol bottle. Her mother admitted pushing her into being the famed
          actress Lillian Roth and projecting her own ambitions onto her, in
          order to survive. Although they hugged and made up, the very-depressed
          Lillian left her mother's apartment and rented a room on the upper
          floor of a hotel, where she attempted suicide by jumping from the skyscraper
          window. But when she was unable to do it, she slumped and fell to the
          floor. Her life had devolved to one of self-pity, self-hate, and self-destruction.
           She left the hotel and wandered on the street, and
          happened to come across an AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) building, where
            she entered and soon made a remarkable comeback in her battle against
          alcohol.  Polio-crippled friend and AA sponsor
          Burt McGuire (Eddie Albert) (whom she eventually married), and two
          others: Selma (Margo) and Jerry (Don &quot;Red&quot; Barry) helped
          her to recover in her hotel room. With their support and encouragement,
          she suffered through painful withdrawal and <i>delirium tremens, </i>and
          after regular attendance at AA meetings, she finally became sober.
           Burt (due to his own feelings of  inadequacy) rebuffed
          and refused to acknowledge her growing love for him. In
          the film's conclusion set in 1953, Lillian was offered an opportunity
          to make an appearance on the <i>This Is
           Your Life</i> NBC-TV program hosted by Ralph Edwards (as Himself)
           in California. She sought advice from Burt about whether she should
           accept the offer. He told her that it was her decision to make on
           her own, and that she didn't need him anymore. He finally confessed
           that he was afraid to allow himself to love her. They agreed that
           together, they would help each other - before kissing. She made a
           courageous decision to go public and appear on the TV show to give
           hope to others who suffered the same pain due to alcoholism. Before
                walking down the aisle of the TV audience to speak to the host,
                she shared her thoughts to Burt (with tears welling up in her
                eyes): (&quot;I
                only know that you get by giving, and this is all I've got to
                give&quot;). Lillian's
              life was introduced by Ralph Edwards, as  &quot;a story of degradation
              and shame, but when you hear the facts, you'll realize how much
              courage it took for her to come here tonight. You'll also realize
              that it's a story full of hope, hope for many who are living and
              suffering in a half-world of addiction to alcohol. Hope for all
              people, whoever and wherever they are, so THIS IS YOUR LIFE, LILLIAN
              ROTH!&quot; </font></p>          </td>

          minutes, D: Robert Aldrich<br />
          Aldrich's suspenseful Cold War Era masterpiece
          was a jarring and violent crime and mystery film that was an adaptation
          of Mickey Spillane's 1952 pulp fiction novel of the same name. It was
          the definitive, apocalyptic, paranoid, science-fiction <i>film noir</i> of
          all time - at the close of the classic noir period. The
          nihilistic independent film featured a cheap and sleazy, contemptible,
          fascistic, hardened private investigator/vigilante named Mike Hammer
          (Ralph Meeker) whose trademarks were brutish violence, the end-justifies-the-means
          philosophy and speed. The tough PI ruthlessly pursued the white-hot,
          deadly apocalyptic object in a mysterious 'Pandora's box' (&quot;the
          Great Whatzit&quot;), ultimately leading to nuclear catastrophe and
          annihilation. In the questing tale, he was driving late one night toward
          Los Angeles when he met up with an almost-naked, barefoot, trench-coat-wearing
          hysterical mental asylum escapee named Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman)
          who was hitchhiking in the middle of the road - naked except for her
          trenchcoat. She was panting heavily and running down the highway. She
          claimed that she had been improperly detained at the institution. She
          claimed she was named after the poet Christina Rossetti - and her last
          words to Hammer were: &quot;Remember me&quot; (both
              spoken and mailed in a letter to him after her death). The two
              were apprehended by villainous thugs who forced them off the road,
              and the mysterious female was quickly tortured and killed (gruesomely
              with pliers semi-off-screen) by the evil pursuers, as the detective
              was semi-conscious. One of the villains was later revealed to be
          Dr. G.E. Soberin (Albert Dekker). During his
          own brutal pursuit of the criminals, recalling her haunting words &quot;Remember
          me,&quot; Hammer
          was aided in his search by his sexy and limber, pimping secretary/lover
          Velda Wickman (or Wakeman) (Maxine Cooper), whose specialty was framing
          men for infidelity. In the Jalisco Hotel, Hammer came across Christina's
          ex-boardinghouse 'roommate' - the real <i>femme
              fatale</i> of the film. She claimed that her name was 'Lily Carver'
              (Gaby Rodgers) - a pixieish, waif-like blonde with closely cropped
              hair wearing a white, terry-cloth bathrobe. She was reclining in
              bed and had a gun pointed at his crotch, but she was a deceptive
              fraud. The strange young lady provided him with her false name
              (her actual name was Gabrielle) and was revealed to be impersonating
              Christina's roommate Lily Carver - whom she had killed. Hammer
          soon learned that Christina was a scientist who had a 'secret' regarding
          a radioactive explosive missing or stolen from the Los Alamos, New
          Mexico Nuclear Test Site. From a morgue, he retrieved a key that Christina
          had swallowed, leading to a locker at the Hollywood Athletic Club,
          where he found a leather-bound and strapped
          case with a searing white-hot light emanating from within. Christina
           had led him to the atomic, 'glowing' box containing the Great Whatzit,
          and a sinister conspirator Dr. Soberin - a trafficker in atomic material
              produced during the Manhattan Project (in Los Alamos, NM), who
              was one of the villains who had tortured Christina earlier. In
              the film's controversial, fiery melt-down climax at Soberin's Malibu
              beach house hideout, his betrayed accomplice Gabrielle
              shot Dr. Soberin, and as he died, Soberin sternly warned her: &quot;Listen
          to me, as if I were Cerberus barking with all his heads at the
              gates of Hell, I will tell you where to take it. But don't, don't
              open the box.&quot; Gabrielle
              then also shot and wounded Hammer in the stomach after seductively
              commanding:
              &quot;Kiss me, Mike. I want you to kiss me. Kiss me.
            The liar's kiss that says 'I love you' means something else.
            You're good at giving such kisses. Kiss me.&quot; Disobediently,
            she greedily raised the cover on the Pandora's box, releasing the
            deadly secret and incinerating herself. She became a flaring pillar
            of fire as it consumed  her. The wounded Hammer freed the kidnapped
            Velda and both fled from the house. As they stumbled together into
            the cooling ocean waters,  they
            watched from the beach as the house was soon engulfed with a wave
            of flashes, fireballs, and series of mushroom-cloud explosions.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Lady and the Tramp (1955), </b>76 minutes, D:
              Disney Studio <br />
              Disney's film (the studio's 15th animated feature film)
        was a musical love story between two anthropomorphic dogs from differing
        classes and backgrounds. The film opened in a small Midwestern town at
        the turn of the century (in the year 1909). In the upper-class two-story
        household of Jim Dear and Darling (with first names only, and with faces
        that were rarely seen), a brown-on-tan, refined female cocker-spaniel
        puppy named Lady was given as a gift by Jim Dear to his wife Darling.
        During her pleasant, well-tended life with the couple, Lady marked her
        six- month milestone by proudly receiving a collar with a license. Across
        town living in the back-streets near the railway yard, another scruffy,
        independent, grey-colored, mangy, roguish stray mutt was introduced,
        named Tramp. The raffish, collar-less, resourceful dog (an
        mixed American breed) roamed the town's streets. The
        expected coming of a baby for Jim Dear and Darling caused Lady
        to become upset, perplexed and worried, and she was increasingly  
        neglected or ignored. After Tramp's arrival
        in the high-class section of town where Lady resided, he  called babies
        &quot;homewreckers&quot; and warned Lady that she would frequently
        be pushed aside: (&quot;When a baby moves in, a dog moves out&quot;).
        A few months after the infant baby boy arrived, Aunt Sarah came to care
        for the house and the baby for a few days during Jim Dear's and Darling's
        short trip. Her two cruel, wily and trouble-making Siamese cats (Si and
        Am) terrorized Lady and the household's pet bird and fish, and caused
        a destructive mess that Aunt Sarah blamed on Lady. She was taken to a
        pet store to be fitted for a combination leash and muzzle. Frightened
         by the experience, Lady ran away and was chased by three  stray dogs
        into the poor side of town on the other side of the tracks. Tramp heroically
        appeared as her hero to fight them off and save her from the threat.
        In the film's most memorable and romantically-sweet sequence, the mongrel
        Tramp introduced Lady to his Wednesday meal location at Tony's Italian
        restaurant where they shared
        a romantic meal of &quot;two spaghetti speciale. Heavy on the meats-a
        ball&quot; at the back entrance to Tony's, and love between them blossomed.
        The next day, Lady was  snagged by the
         dog-catcher and separated from Tramp, and taken to the local City
        Dog Pound, where she met a number of other incarcerated, unlicensed stray
        dogs. Fortunately for Lady, her license and collar identified her and
        she was returned home, but remained shaken by the experience, and banished
        from the house and chained to the yard's doghouse by Aunt Sarah. Although
        Tramp was dismissed by Lady (who had learned about all of his part lady-friiends
        from the dogs at the pound), he was alerted by Lady's barking to an
        approaching rat that was threatening to enter the house and attack the
        baby in the upstairs nursery. Tramp redeemed himself when he viciously
        and heroically fought against the disgusting large rat and killed it,
        but Aunt Sarah misinterpreted Tramp as an intruder and contacted the
        dog-catcher to take him away. Once Jim Dear and Darling returned shortly
        later, Lady was able to vindicate Tramp by showing them the dead rat,
        and Tramp was rescued. By Christmastime as the film concluded,
        Tramp (now domesticated and with his own license and collar) had been
        adopted as part of Lady's family and household, and they were proud parents
        of a litter of four puppies (the three females were identical to Lady
        and the one male was Tramp-like). </font></p></td>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Ladykillers (1955, UK)</b>, 91 minutes, D: Alexander Mackendrick<br />
Director Alexander Mackendrick's and one of Ealing Studio's best slapstick farces
was this post-war, black comedy and crime-caper story. It received an Academy
Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The brisk and comically-macabre
British film functioned as a satire of the contemporary heist film (including <a href="asph.html"><i>The
Asphalt Jungle (1950)</i></a> and shortly later Kubrick's <i>The Killing (1956)</i>),
in its tale of a formidable  old lady who unwittingly but repeatedly
foiled the plans of a group of criminals. The film opened in the 1950s with a
view of an Edwardian estate situated in a cul-de-sac, and constructed over
the entrance to a railway tunnel at King's Cross station in London.
The home's resident-owner - sweet-natured, loveable, harmless, very-proper, elderly
and widowed Mrs. Louisa Wilberforce (Katie Johnson) was known to have a wild
and strange imagination, and often filed specious reports with the local
police. A sinister, shaggy-haired, ghoulish, toothy and duplicitous
        mastermind named Marcus (Alec Guinness), posing as a &quot;Professor,&quot;
        came to her door and inquired about renting her two-room apartment in
        the rear of her well-positioned but dilapidated house.  He deceptively
        told the naive octogenarian that he was a member of an amateur
        string quintet that needed to practice and rehearse classical music.
        In fact, the string quintet was composed of Marcus' foursome gang of
        bumbling, odd-ball criminal thieves, including 'One-Round'/Mr. Lawson
        (Danny Green), Harry/Mr. Robinson (Peter Sellers), Claude/Major Courtney
        (Cecil Parker), and Louis/Mr. Harvey (Herbert Lom). The gang's objective
        was to plan and stage a robbery of an armored and secure bank van that
        regularly delivered funds in shiny stainless steel boxes to the nearby
        railway station. Afterwards, the group's plan was  to store the
        heist-money (&pound;60,000) on the platform at King's Cross station,
        and then the innocent-looking Mrs. Wilberforce would be assigned to pick
        up the &quot;lolly&quot; (loot).
        The heist itself went smoothly, but the transport of a trunk holding
        the four steel boxes was more problematic. Surprisingly, the police assisted
        in getting the trunk ultimately delivered to Mrs. Wilberforce's house.
        When the robbers were in the process of leaving the house with the money
        as Mrs. Wilberforce was bidding them farewell, she inadvertently witnessed
        'One-Round' accidentally spill the contents of his cello case (filled
        with banknotes). At the same time,  the arrival of a group of her
        geriatric friends for tea brought the realization  that the newspaper's
        recent headlines implicated the musical quintet as the bank robbers:
        (&quot;a terrible robbery at King's Cross station at 1:00 o'clock this
        afternoon&quot;).
        The gang members attempted to argue with Mrs. Wilberforce to ignore the
        crime, or to convince her that she was an accomplice, but they were
        unsuccessful when she suggested going to the police station to immediately
        turn herself in. The desperate criminals decided she must be eliminated
        and used matchsticks to draw lots to determine who would kill her. In
        the fllm's denouement, the plot to kill Mrs. W. quickly went awry - and
        one by one, all of the criminals turned their frustrated hatred towards
        themselves. All of them were eliminated as they tried to betray, double-cross,
        and fool each other. There was no evidence left of the pile-up of dead
        bodies, since each one was disposed of by being taken away in a wheelbarrow,
        and then dropped from a railway bridge into the open carts of passing
        steam trains. Mrs. Wilberforce was left as the sole beneficiary of the
        money, who then decided to responsibly visit the local police station
        to report the robbery. Her tale was too unbelievable
        to be taken seriously, and to her astonishment, she was told to just
        keep the alleged money. During her return home, she gave a startled,
        starving artist a generously-large denomination bank-note that he at
        first protested. </font></p></td>

                Sins of </strong><b>Lola Mont&egrave;s</b><strong>)</strong>, 110 minutes, D: Max Ophuls<br />
Director Max Ophuls' inspired first (and last) color and widescreen film -- in
CinemaScope -- was this technically brilliant, visually-ambitious, historical-biopic
and epic drama about the tragic amorous liaisons of the elitist aristocracy,
and the scandalous, cruel creation and crude exploitation of a society  
fixated on 'celebrity' status. In particular, the film demystified the life story
of a notorious, sexy and ribald seductress, often viewed with complicated tracking
shots. The plot was structured as a series of cyclical, flashbacked, non-chronological,
disjointed tableaux that re-enacted her scandalous life, populated by various
acrobats, dwarfs, equestrians, and other performers (including a strongman) in
the central circus ring of the tawdry Mammoth Circus. An exploitative, top-hatted,
circus RingMaster (Peter Ustinov) began a lengthy
        and sensationalized speech to an unseen, expectant audience about the
main sideshow attraction of the bizarre and gaudy circus being held in New Orleans,
LA. The now aged title character Lola Mont&egrave;s (Martine Carol) (with declining
health) was being promoted as an infamous, 19th-century Spanish/Irish-born adventuress,
paramour and courtesan-prostitute: &quot;Here, ladies and gentlemen, the truth,
nothing but the truth on the extraordinary life of Lola Montes, reenacted by
the entire company in pantomime, acrobatics, tableaux vivants, with music and
dance and with the entire orchestra.&quot; The exploits of her scandalous, lurid and
notorious life would soon be dramatically re-enacted and staged for the circus
audience. After a question and answer period about Lola's life  conducted
by the RingMaster, the remainder of the film was composed of a series
              of reenactments or episodic flashbacks into aspects of Lola's scandalous
              life, loves and dance career. The RingMaster continued to orchestrate
and narrate the story of her past as a commercial, untouchable spectacle, seen
in the flashbacked vignettes. The men involved in love affairs with Lola included
composer Franz Liszt (Will Quadflieg), 
             a five-year marriage to the lover of her own mother - Lieutenant
Thomas James (Ivan Desny), married musical orchestra Kapellmeister/Conductor
        Claudio Pirotto (Claude Pinoteau), naive, 20 year-old
          idealist, Latin teacher and leftist German student revolutionary (Oskar
        Werner) in Bavaria, and the half-deaf and elderly King Ludwig I (Anton
        Walbrook) of Bavaria. The flashbacks and re-enactments ended with the
RingMaster reminding the audience that Lola finally took him up on his offer
to work for the circus, where she had been employed for four months. Lola's
        final acrobatic, trapeze stunt was a dangerous, death-defying plunge &quot;fraught
        with danger&quot; - to dramatize and depict herself as a &quot;fallen
woman.&quot; Lola's act was followed
          by a quick cut to black as she hit her target (without a safety net).
Another commercial enterprise was proposed by the RingMaster who exhorted male
patrons over 16 to approach and pay a dollar to touch or kiss Lola's hand. She
            was enclosed, entrapped or enshrined - like a beast - in a wooden
        animal cage. A long line-up of eager, top-hatted 
            male customers were ready to worship and 'celebrate' Lola. Her last
        words to the RingMaster were: &quot;I'll be all right.&quot; The film
        ended with a lengthy camera pull-back along the extensive line of gawking
        admirers awaiting Lola, and finally tracking out beyond closing curtains
        (crudely painted with scenes of Lola's life). </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Man From Laramie (1955)</strong>, 103
              minutes, D: Anthony Mann<br />
              The fifth (and final) western that paired Anthony Mann and James
              Stewart was another complex psychological western, filmed in widescreen
              CinemaScope, and often thought of as a retelling of the plot of
          Shakespeare's <i>King Lear. </i>The title character
          (the 'man from Laramie') was in actuality a US Cavalry officer Captain
          named Will Lockhart (James Stewart).
          Lockhart was posing as a mule-train wagon driver bringing three wagonloads
              of supplies to the town of Coronado, NM, to be delivered to Mercantile
              storekeeper Barbara Waggoman (Cathy O'Donnell). She was a refined
              young woman who admitted she was ready to quit the business and
          return to the East Coast. Lockhart's main obsessed
          goal (he kept both his military position and objective a secret for
          most of the film) was hateful revenge against those who sold repeating
          rifles to the Apaches, used to massacre a 12-man cavalry detachment
          at Dutch Creek that claimed his younger lieutenant brother's life six
          months earlier. As a newcomer to town, Lockhart claimed to Barbara
          that he had come from Laramie, but that it wasn't his home. Lockhart
          became suspicious when he noticed an automatic rifle (traded by an
          Apache) hanging in Barbara's store. Soon, Lockhart became embroiled
          in a struggle in Coronado, NM with storekeeper Barbara's loutish, volatile,
          immature, sadistic and psychopathic cousin Dave Waggoman (Alex Nicol),
          over trespassing charges and unintended theft of lagoon salt. During
              the misunderstanding, Lockhart was lassoed and dragged through
              a campfire on his stomach in the dirt, and his three wagons were
              burned and twelve mules were shot. Dave's surrogate brother Vic
              Hansbro (Arthur Kennedy) arrived and called off the humiliating
              and unjust punishment. Lockhart vowed to stick around and seek
              retribution for his harsh treatment, and to discover who was selling
          rifles to the Apaches. Lockhart returned to town and Barbara's store,
          where she warned him about her uncle - influential elderly patriarch
              Alec Waggoman (Donald Crisp), the almost-blind (physically and
              emotionally), wealthy, autocratic cattle baron patriarch of the
              Barb Ranch empire. The next day in town, Lockhart
          entered into a fist-fighting brawl, first with Dave, and then with
          Vic - the two rival 'sons' of Alec Waggoman. Coming to Lockhart's defense
          as a bystander was Kate Canady (Aline MacMahon), a tough, headstrong
              female rancher at Half Moon Ranch in the area. The fight was interrupted
              by the arrival of Alec on horseback, who insisted that Lockhart
              leave the area immediately, suspecting that Lockhart was a hired
              gun. However, he promised to pay restitution for Lockhart's destroyed
          property the next day at his ranch, while on his way out of town. Waggoman's
          two 'sons' were engaged in a power struggle over inheritance
          of the Barb Ranch. Currently, Vic was more sensible and responsible
          as the ranch's hired foreman-manager than Alec's favored, incompetent
          and blood-lusting natural son Dave. Vic's plan was to remain at the
          ranch and marry his engaged fiancee Barbara: (&quot;I've worked my
          whole life for the Barb&quot;),
              although she insisted on moving away from town. Barbara explained
              how she despised the ruthless and greedy Waggoman for breaking
          promises and ruining her recently-deceased father. Lockhart became
          acquainted with Kate Canady, one of Alec's long-time main rivals who
          owned a ranch at Half Moon that Alec had been trying to possess for
          28 years. Lockhart was invited to her ranch and offered a job as her
          new foreman, but he declined. He hinted at his vengeful mission to
          seek justice for his younger brother. At one time much earlier, Kate
          had been engaged to Alec Waggoman, but was stood up by him. While
          being reimbursed $600 dollars for restitution by Waggoman at the ranch,
          Lockhart realized that Alec wouldn't answer questions about how he
          had responded six months earlier to the cavalry detachment's massacre
          on his ranch land at Dutch Creek. Shortly later, Lockhart was falsely
          accused and jailed by Sheriff Tom Quigby (James Millican) as the prime
          suspect in the knifing murder of the town's weasely drunk Chris Boldt
          (Jack Elam), who had information to sell about the gun sales. While
          Lockhart was incarcerated, Alec visited and told him
          about his repeated haunting dreams of an unidentified murderous stranger
          (presumably Lockhart) killing his son Dave: (&quot;He comes to kill
          my boy&quot;). After receiving a temporary writ to bail Lockhart out of jail, the scheming
          and persistent Kate blackmailed him into accepting her offer to work
          as Half Moon's foreman. Meanwhile, Alec continued to 
          worry that his son Dave would be an ill-suited and incompetent manager
          of the Barb Ranch after his passing, and seemed to be moving toward
          favoring Vic more than his true son Dave. During another violent encounter
          with the crazed son Dave when Lockhart was herding Kate's cattle, he
          was shot in his shooting hand at point-blank range with his own gun.
          Wounded and in pain, Lockhart cried out: &quot;Why, you scum!&quot;,
          and then rode away defeated. In the midst of their strained
          relationship, Vic and Dave were both  complicit and involved in
          continuing gun-running arms-sales to the Indians, with an imminent
          sale of a cache of 200 rifles to the Apaches concealed in wooden boxes
          marked 'WIRE FENCING&quot; within an open wagon. During a violent argument
          between the two about the sale, Vic shot and killed Dave in self-defense
          when he drew his gun. Vic brought Dave's body back to the Barb
          Ranch, and falsely accused Lockhart of Dave's murder, although
          Lockhart vehemently denied the charges. Meanwhile, Alec noticed
          an exorbitant and suspicious bill of sale for fence wire - proof that
          someone was stealing money, padding invoices and was profitably buying
          and then selling guns to the Indians. When Vic wouldn't give a definitive
              answer to Alec about what he knew, the two rode to search in the
              hills for the wagon holding the rifles. When they scuffled together
              on the trail just before locating the wagon, Alec was accidentally
              pushed off his horse and rolled down a steep ravine - Vic presumed
              that the unconscious Alec was dead and left him. Lockhart found
              the badly-bruised Alec, took him to Kate's place at Half Moon to
              tend to his injuries, and saved his life (although Alec was now
          totally blind). At his bedside, Alec informed
          Lockhart about the sale of guns to the Apaches by both Dave and Vic.
          Alec now realized that in his dreams, Vic was the one who had killed
          Dave, not Lockhart. Lockhart immediately rode off to locate Vic in
          the hills with the rifle wagon as he was about to smoke-signal the
          Apaches. He confronted him (&quot;I came 1,000 miles to kill you, Hansbro&quot;)
          and accused him of being complicitly guilty in the sale of guns that
          were used to kill his young brother at the Dutch Creek Massacre. Lockhart
              forced Vic, at gunpoint, to destroy the rifles he was intending
              to sell to the Indians, by helping him to push his wagon over the
              cliff. Afterwards, Lockhart pointed his gun at Vic, but was unable
              to kill him in cold-blood. Vic fled but was shot three times (and
          suffered an arrow in the back) by the outraged Apaches. As
          the film concluded, Alec and Kate were both reconciled and were intending
          to get married once he fully recovered. However, there remained an
          unresolved relationship between Lockhart and Barbara. They bid each
          other goodbye outside near Kate's front porch. Barbara had already
          confirmed for Lockhart that she was planning to leave Coronado and
          move back East. He responded with the revelation that he was a Captain
          in the US cavalry serving in Laramie: &quot;When you go East, you'll
          pass through Laramie. And, uh, if you should ask for a Captain Lockhart,
          almost anybody'd tell you where to find me.&quot; With some hope for
          their future together, she replied: &quot;I'll remember that.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Man With the Golden Arm (1955)</b>, 119 minutes, D: Otto Preminger<br />
        Director Otto Preminger's code-defying, ground-breaking, powerful drama
            was about heroin addiction - it was the first major Hollywood film
          about the taboo subject. In the late 1940s, Frankie &quot;Dealer&quot; Machine
            (Frank Sinatra) - a rehabilitated prison-hospital ex-con, returned
              to his slummy and squalid Chicago neighborhood after
              serving 6-months time at the federal Narcotic Farm-Hospital in
              Lexington, Kentucky. His nickname &quot;Dealer&quot; was due to
              his professional and lucrative poker dealing skill. During his
              time served for not squealing when he &quot;took the rap&quot; for
              illegal gambling, he had learned to play the drums, and was now
              an aspiring big-band jazz drummer. He bragged that his drum teacher
             had told him he had &quot;arms made of pure gold.&quot; Frankie
             was determined to restore his life to order after becoming clean
             in prison, but immediately he began to fall back into his old habits
             by first visiting his favorite bar hang-out - Antek's Tug 'n' Maul
             Tavern - next door to where he lived. There, he was surrounded by
             his oily and smarmy, dandified drug dealer supplier &quot;Nifty
             Louie&quot; Fomorowski
             (Darren McGavin), and Frankie's small-time hoodlum,
              gambling boss and illicit card-game manager Zero Schwiefka (Robert
             Strauss). In  his tenement rooming-house apartment, Frankie
          met up with his dependent, neurotic, greedy and nagging wife -
          the lying and deceiving 25 year-old Sophia &quot;Zosh&quot; Machine
          (Eleanor Parker). She was allegedly crippled from spinal injuries and
          wheelchair bound after a car accident three years earlier when DUI
          Frankie was at the wheel. They were married in the hospital chapel,
          and since then, she was using her disability and helplessness as a
          means to manipulatively maintain Frankie's support by keeping him guilt-ridden.
          She urged him to continue gambling and dealing for Schwiefka and give
          up his dreams of being a jazz drummer. Frankie also became reacquainted
          with his neighbor - ex-flame and Club Safari stripclub/bar hostess/mistress
          Molly Novotny (Kim Novak). In the film's most devastating sequence,
          Frankie reverted to his addiction (presumably heroin) when he succumbed
          to becoming hooked again after being lured to Louie's nearby apartment
          for just one fix (for $5 bucks). During a marathon  weekend poker game
          that had been arranged by Schwiefka with two big-time gamblers, the
          indebted Frankie was compelled to continue playing with promises of
          money and another fix. By Sunday evening and into early Monday morning,
          the exhausted Frankie resorted to cheating, was caught and beaten up,
          and the duplicitous Schwiefka denounced  Frankie and fired him. Frankie
          barged into Louie's place desperate for another injection, but when
          he was denied any more fixes, Frankie knocked him out and searched
          the apartment for drugs without finding anything. At his Monday audition
          try-out arranged by musical talent agent Harry Lane (Will Wright),
          Frankie experienced a devastating breakdown while heavily
            sweating and trembling (with debilitating withdrawal symptoms). He
           couldn't keep the beat, knew he had failed, and slinked away. Louie
          entered Frankie's apartment to seek revenge, and discovered that Zosh
          was  faking her disability when he saw her walking around. She
            retaliated with intense hysteria and pushed Louie to his death down
            the stairwell, because she feared that he would ruin her life by
            divulging the truth that she was a phony. Zosh then reported the
            death to police Captain Bednar (Emile Meyer), and implicitly blamed
          and incriminated Frankie for the crime. After seeming to lose all hope,
          Frankie sought out Molly who had moved to a different apartment 
          and begged her for money for another fix - but she adamantly refused.
          She further challenged him to go &quot;cold turkey&quot; so that he
          could clearly answer questions when the police would undoubtedly question
           him. Frankie decided with Molly - in a sensational and painful sequence,
          to detoxify himself, and after a few days,
          he was again sober.  In the final concluding twist in the film, Zosh
             was confronted by Frankie in their apartment who informed her that
            he was leaving to get away from all the tempting things that had
          lured him back into being a junkie. When she objected and accusingly
          suspected he wanted to be with Molly, she forgetfully stood up. Her
          self-incrimination was witnessed by Frankie, and by Captain Bednar
          and Molly who arrived at the door. Obviously, she had been fraudulently
          stringing everyone along. Before Zosh could be arrested
            by Captain Bednar, she fled from the apartment, blew her distress
            whistle around her neck, and committed suicide by throwing herself
          off the balcony onto the brick street below. Her death freed Frankie
          to possibly live a cleaner life with Molly (in the tagged-on and contrived
          happy ending different from the source novel). </font></p>        </td>

              D: Delbert Mann<br />
            This Best-Picture winning film, a poignant, simple character study,
            was a  modest, black and white film in an era of widescreen color
            epics. Its critical acclaim and box-office success were phenomenal.
            It was the second Best Picture Oscar-winning film to also win the
            top prize (known as the Golden Palm (Palme d'Or)) at Cannes, and
            it remains one of the best examples of the cinematization of a television
            play. The plot followed the despairing and lonely life
              (over a 36 hour period) of 34 year-old Marty Piletti (Ernest Borgnine
              in an Oscar-winning performance) - an ordinary, burly, heavy-set,
              overweight Bronx butcher who still lived with his love-smothering,
            widowed Italian Catholic mother Theresa Piletti (Esther Minciotti).
            Marty often had recurring conversations when hanging out with his
            best friend Angie (Joe Mantell) at Michael's Restaurant about their
            endlessly boring and aimless plans for most evenings: Angie: &quot;What
            do you feel like doing tonight?&quot; Marty: &quot;I don't know,
            Ange. What do <i>you</i> feel like doing?&quot; When Marty's overbearing
            mother kept goading, nagging and pressuring him to get married, he
            frustratingly confessed to her that he was an unwanted &quot;fat
            ugly man&quot; and didn't want to be hurt and rejected again. After
            endless pressure from his mother, Marty dragged himself to the Stardust
            Ballroom on a Saturday night and happened   to meet a kindred
            soul - another homely wallflower, a 29 year-old mousy Brooklyn high
            school chemistry teacher Clara Snyder (Betsy Blair) who had just
            been abandoned by her own blind date for being unattractive and boring.
            Their relationship slowly developed during the evening beginning
            with a dance they shared together. After leaving the dance hall and
            going to a luncheonette for coffee, the two engaged in very realistic
            and honest conversation. Each confided and excitedly spoke about
            their life's hopes and dreams. During a brief visit to Marty's home,
            his mother expressed concern about
            the impact of losing her influence over her son, now that Marty had
            a date. Later, in front of her house as he said goodnight
              to Clara, Marty promised to call her to confirm a date for the
            following evening. In the touching film's concluding
            sequence on Sunday at about 8 pm, Marty was able to overcome the
            oppressive fears of his mother about being abandoned, and biased
            misgivings expressed by Angie and other friends and relatives. At
             first, he had postponed calling Clara in the afternoon - who was
            sitting at home with her parents watching TV and awaiting his call,
            sensing that her phone might never ring. Ultimately, Marty put aside
            his doubts about his changing life, peer pressures to not date Clara,
            and cruel critiques of Clara as a &quot;dog.&quot; He courageously
            and defiantly defended his love for Clara to his friends during another
            boring and tedious Sunday afternoon and evening at home and at Michael's
            Restaurant. At the restaurant, the  determined Marty decided to
            make his promised phone call (in a phone booth) to Clara to plan
            a movie date so that they could get together again. The
            pair chose to be liberated and triumphant over their respective limitations.</font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Mister Roberts (1955),</b> 123 minutes, D: John
              Ford and Mervyn LeRoy <br />
              This wartime comedy-drama was about the interactions
              of the crew of a WWII re-supply cargo ship (the <i>USS Reluctant</i>)
               in the South Pacific in the spring of 1945 - to face up against
              and defy their tyrannical ship captain (James Cagney). The screenplay
              by Frank S. Nugent and Joshua Logan was based upon the 1946 novel
              and the 1948 Broadway play. Disgust was expressed early on by Lt.
              Douglas 'Mister' Roberts (Henry Fonda) for Lieut. Commander 'Captain'
              Morton's palm tree (given as a reward for efficiently moving the
              most cargo), as he spoke to the ship's physician Lt. 'Doc' (William
              Powell) early one morning. Lt. Roberts was a well-liked officer
              who reluctantly served on the WWII naval cargo supply-ship 'bucket' <i>USS
              Reluctant</i> (known as &quot;The Bucket&quot;), that brought combat
               ships supplies such as TP, toothpaste,
            paint, soap, and other items. The tree
            became a symbol of the Captain's authoritarian rule. However, Roberts
            pined for real war action and yearned for a transfer into a combat
            zone but was never granted a transfer by the stubborn Captain.
            Another major character was cowardly and lazy, prank-playing Ensign
            Frank T. Pulver (Oscar-winning Jack Lemmon), the laundry and morale
            officer. At their next stop, the male crew was anxious and itching
            to be granted shore leave after more than a year aboard the ship
            (after spotting nurses on the dock), but the Captain insisted that
            only Roberts and Ensign Pulver would be allowed onshore to pick up
            supplies. During his shore leave, Pulver convinced Lieut. Ann Girard
            (Betsy Palmer), one of the visiting nurses, to meet him later onboard
            the <i>USS Reluctant. </i>In a humorous scene, 'Doc' and Lt. Roberts
            mixed up a batch of scotch (from water, Coke, and a &quot;drop of
            iodine for taste&quot;, and &quot;one
            drop of hair tonic for age&quot;) for Pulver's R&amp;R aboard ship
            rendezvous, but the plan of seduction failed. Another of Pulver's
            pranks on VE Day was to explode a homemade firecracker (with &quot;fulminate
            of mercury&quot;) under the Captain's bunk, but his plan backfired
            when it blew up the laundry and caused an overflow of soapy suds
            throughout the ship's corridors. With the war soon coming to a close,
            Roberts gave up hope that he would ever serve combat duty. He gave
            a salute to the Captain's revered palm tree before heaving it off
            the ship, causing an incensed Captain Morton to vow to find the culprit.
            The Captain faced a 'show-down' with 'Mister' Roberts
              - but forgot to turn off the PA system as he accused Roberts of
              breaking his promise to him; the crew was able to listen to  the
              Captain's strong-armed tactics and dastardly bargain with 'Mister'
              Roberts (about the crew's shore leave in exchange for an end to
              his letters) - and as a result, the crew felt renewed respect for their officer for sacrificing
            his own ambitions for them. Weeks later, the crew helped to forge
            a transfer request for Mister Roberts (including the Captain's forged
            signature), and Roberts was successfully transferred to a combat
            ship. Roberts was deeply moved when he was presented  with a handmade
            medal shaped like a palm tree and inscribed: &quot;Order of the Palm,
            for action against the enemy above and beyond the call of duty.&quot; Pulver
            was promoted to Roberts' vacated position as cargo officer, and the
            Captain brought in a scrawny replacement palm tree for the deck.
            The final scene was composed of two letter-reading scenes (both read
            by Ensign Pulver for the crew) with the first excited letter from
            'Mister' Doug Roberts (written three weeks earlier) who was now serving
            his new assignment on board the <i>USS Livingston</i> during
            the Battle of Okinawa, including his statement that he would rather have his old crew's
            hand-made Order of the Palm medal than the Congressional Medal of
            Honor. During the second letter reading, this
            one from Pulver's friend Fornell (also on the <i>USS Livingston</i>),
            Pulver was stunned by the news that Mister Roberts had died in action
            during a kamikaze raid: (&quot;Mister Roberts is dead. This is from
            Fornell. They took a Jap suicide plane and killed everybody in a
            twin 40 battery and went right on through and killed Doug and some
            other officer, in the wardroom. They were drinking coffee when it
            hit&quot;). With a determined and resolute look on his face, Pulver tossed the
          Captain's replacement palm tree off the ship's deck into the water,
          entered the bridge, banged on Captain Morton's door, and finally stood
          up to him - with the film's final line of dialogue about his complaint
          that the movie to be shown that night had been cancelled: (&quot;Captain,
          it is I, Ensign Pulver, and I just threw your stinkin' palm tree overboard!
          Now what's all this crud about no movie tonight?&quot;). Obviously,
          the spirit of Mister Roberts would live on in Pulver.</font></p>          </td>

              32 minutes, D: Alain Resnais<br />
              This short, potent and very poignant French documentary about genocide
              was filmed 10 years following the end of WWII, and provided a profound
              exploration of the sinister Nazi concentration death camps at 
              Auschwitz-Birkenau and Majdanek. The haunting movie about the barbarity
            of the &quot;Final Solution&quot;  was descriptively narrated (a
            detached voice-over by Michel Bouquet). The documentary began by
            surveying the colorful, present &quot;peaceful landscape&quot; around
            the former main death camp, with barbed wire fencing, the railroad
            tracks that brought prisoners, the guard towers, and the abandoned
            empty buildings where the Jews were housed and mostly exterminated.
            These views were interspersed with archival, historical black and
            white footage of Hitler addressing hordes of his followers of the
            Third Reich at Nuremberg in 1933 during his rise to power (&quot;The
            machine gets underway&quot;). The
            camps were built in preparation for rounding up and moving millions
            of Jews on crowded and sealed boxcar trains on tracks leading to
            the barren camp's living areas: (&quot;Hunger, thirst, suffocation,
            madness&quot;),
                arriving in the &quot;night and fog&quot; - &quot;The first sight
                of the camp. It's another planet.&quot; The &quot;political
                prisoners&quot; were stripped, shaved, tattooed, numbered, and
                 uniformed, and then housed in crowded bunk areas (with three
                to a bunk). During the day, those who were chosen as workers
                were marched off to a factory or quarry in all weather conditions
                while supervised by the SS. There were harsh and relentless images
                of the severity of treatment, including &quot;hospitals&quot; for
                lethal drug injections, &quot;needless operations, amputations, 
				experimental mutilations,&quot; castrations,
               and chemical factories testing their toxic products on prisoners
               (&quot;guinea pigs&quot;), with a view of crude operating tables
               with canals that channeled blood to a central drain. The Kapos
               (cruel supervisors) at the camps maintained a brothel with
              &quot;better-fed women but equally doomed to die.&quot; There were
              prisons with inhumane tiny cells designed for torture - air vents
              were not soundproof, allowing for the horrors to be heard (&quot;Air
              vents don't muffle the cries&quot;). The
              film documented how Nazi officer Heinrich Himmler arrived with
              the goal of annihilating and exterminating as many camp prisoners
              as possible with greater efficiency by building gas chambers and
              crematoriums: (&quot;A crematorium might look a bit like a postcard.
              Today, tourists have their picture taken in front of them&quot;);
              Zyklon gas was used. Women and children and the weak and elderly
              were often immediately separated upon arrival and executed. The
              film photographed the outside and interior of a typical gas chamber,
              constructed to appear to be a shower room (with locked doors),
              with close-ups of finger-nail scratch marks on the concrete ceiling
              of a gas chamber. Newly-constructed crematoriums were very successful:
              (&quot;The new ovens consumed thousands of bodies a day&quot;),
              but couldn't handle the backlog of bodies,
              so large wooden pyres were built: &quot;When the crematoria prove
              insufficient, pyres are set up.&quot; The
              film built to a climax with shocking, gruesome, sobering and horrific
              images of the Holocaust victims - with stockpiles of discarded
              eyeglasses, hair combs, clothing, warehouse piles of shaved-off
              women's hair (to make cloth material and rugs) and bones (to make
              fertilizer), rooms filled with emaciated dead bodies (to make soap) and
              decapitated heads stacked neatly in large buckets. Human skin was
              used to make sheets of paper; the lifeless corpses were bulldozed
              into a mass grave. The film concluded with the liberation of the
              country and the camps, and questioning who was responsible for
              the atrocities - kapos and officers all testified: &quot;I'm not
              responsible.&quot; The narrator then memorably asked as the film returned to views of
              the present day facility and surveyed the ruins: &quot;Then who
              is responsible. As I speak to you now, cold water from the ponds
              and ruins fills the mass graves, a water as cold and murky as our
              own faulty memory. War has dozed off - one eye still open.... Nine
              million dead haunt this landscape.&quot; The
              film pondered questions about why and how the apocalyptic Holocaust
              had ever happened, and how it might inform the historical future
              with a final warning that the unique event could be repeated -
              and the urgent need for vigilance if we ever forget the past (in
              the fog of suppression). </font></p>          </td>

                  (1955)</a>,</b> 93 minutes, D: Charles Laughton<br />
            This was the only film directed by actor and stage director Charles
            Laughton - and unbelievably, was not nominated for any
        Academy Awards. It was a  stark, film noirish, black-and-white thriller.
        In the film's opening, 
          crazed and deranged psychopathic serial killer Preacher Harry Powell
          (Robert Mitchum) was prowling the Ohio River Valley  in search of rich
          widow victims. The sinister, malevolent, black-cloaked, wide-brimmed
          and hatted 'Preacher' was driving in a stolen Model T Essex, as he
          delivered a chilling, perversely evil and memorable monologue to the
          Lord. He personified one polar end of the struggle
          between good and evil, with tattoos of LOVE and HATE on the fingers
          of both hands. Powell entered the rural town of  Cresap's Landing 
           in malevolent pursuit of a $10,000 cache of money, believed to be
          in the possession of the Harper family: widowed wife Willa Harper (Shelley
          Winters) of a condemned killer (Powell's earlier prison cellmate),
          and her two children: young 9 year-old John Harper (Billy Chapin),
          and young Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce). The
          film's most memorable sequence was his recitation of a monologue during
          his own hand-wrestling  that provided commentary on the eternal
          battle between the forces of good and evil that grappled together. He
          manipulatively wed the lonely widow Willa, and
            then frighteningly and ritualistically knifed her to death on their
            honeymoon night in their A-frame bedroom.  In a creepy, nightmarish,
            hypnotically-eerie scene, Willa's corpse was discovered  sitting
            underwater in a Model T with her long blonde hair tangling, swaying,
            and mingling diaphanously in the current with the river's underwater
            reeds. Powell then went on a relentless hunt or campaign against
           his own innocent step-children across the Depression Era Bible Belt
          to get at their father's stolen fortune of $10,000. The children had
             escaped and fled to their father's skiff, where Powell could not
            reach them in time. They experienced a lyrical, fairy-tale-like
            nighttime sequence of  floating down the river amidst God's
            benevolent creatures on the shoreline (a croaking frog, rabbits,
            an owl, tortoise, sheep, and a spider's web). The
            final segment pitted the Preacher against plain, Bible-fearing farm
            woman Mrs. Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish). She was  a strong-willed
            opponent - a kindly, warm-hearted, benevolent savior and  elderly
            matriarchal widow who protectively rescued children, including young
            John and Pearl. She served as a symbol of protecting Goodness, rocking at night on a porch with
            a shotgun across her lap, while he sang his perverse hymn in counterpoint: &quot;Leaning
            on the Everlasting Arms.&quot; In the
            conclusion, Powell was arrested, the money was revealed (in Pearl's
            doll), and Rachel offered triumphant, reassuring final words
            at Christmas-time to the two orphaned, brutalized
            children who had reclaimed their innocence after many nights of
            being hunted by a demon. She delivered a prayer: &quot;Lord,
            save little children. The wind blows and the rain's a-cold. Yet they
          abide...They abide and they endure.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Oklahoma! (1955)</b>, 145 minutes, D:  Fred Zinnemann</font><br />
          <font size="2">Director Fred Zinnemann's wildly-acclaimed first musical
              was the most expensive film ever made to that time, with an exorbitant
              budget of $7 million dollars. It had somber and dark undertones,
               unusual for a musical, due to its themes of jealousy and unfulfilled
              sexual desire between rivals in a troublesome love triangle, bold
        sexual innuendo, and violence.  The 
        Oscar-winning Best Score (with many memorable standards from Richard
        Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II in their first collaboration together)
        also featured Agnes De Mille's choreography, and uniquely integrated
        its characters, plot and songs. The setting for the frontier-themed musical
              film was the Oklahoma Territory in the early 1900s shortly before
              Oklahoma statehood (in late 1907). The main story was about the
              developing romances between two cowboys with their sweethearts
        - with complications involving rival suitors disrupting both relationships.
              Fun-loving and mischievous cowboy Curly McLain (Gordon MacRae)
              was courting and secretly in love with Laurey Williams (Shirley
              Jones in her film debut), a sweet farmgirl - the niece of Aunt
        Eller Murphy (Charlotte Greenwood). To spite and make the over-confident
        and &quot;big-headed&quot; Curly jealous, Laury refused
              Curly's invitation to the town's fund-raising, Saturday night box-social
        dance, in which the ladies brought hamper-baskets to be bid upon at an
              auction to raise money for a schoolhouse. Instead, Laurey chose
        to be escorted by Aunt Eller's disturbed, rough, frightening and
        brutish farm-hand Jud Fry (Rod Steiger). At the same time, roving, dim-witted
          but good-natured cowboy Will Parker (Gene Nelson) arrived at the nearby
              Claremore train station, returning from Kansas City (from
        a state fair and rodeo). Will was hoping to reunite with naive &quot;Ado&quot; Annie
        Carnes (Gloria Grahame), Laurey's clueless, promiscuous best friend.
        During his absence, he was unaware that Annie had become seriously involved
        with manipulative, smooth-talking Persian Ali Hakim (Eddie Albert), a
        womanizing traveling salesman/peddler. Annie's shotgun-toting, protective
        father Andrew Carnes (James Whitmore)  disallowed
        Will from marrying his daughter because Will was broke after spending
         $50 cash on presents for her. Instead, he approved
        her shotgun engagement to the peddler Ali after hearing that the two
        admitted to having sex near a haystack in the moonlight. Just before
        the box-social, Laurey was experiencing a period of distress and conflict
        between her two suitors (the warm-hearted, socially-approved Curly and
        the menacing Jud). She utilized a bottle of Ali's smelling salts elixir
        in order to induce a dream - to find answers to her romantic hopes -
        in the film's expressionistic, ground-breaking, red-hued and dialogueless &quot;Laurey's
        Dream Ballet&quot; production number. Afterwards, on the way to the box-social
        in an open buggy with Jud, Laurey was sexually assaulted by him, and
        proceeded to the festivities without him. During the auction, a bidding
        war broke out between Curly and Jud for Laurey's picnic hamper, ultimately
        won by Curly, who sold his saddle, horse, and gun. Concurrently,
        Will was able to reacquire $50 dollars cash, required by her father in
        order to marry Annie. Ali gave his blessing to Annie to marry Will, and eventually ended up
        in a shotgun marriage to Gertie Cummings (Barbara Lawrence) who had earlier
        shown an interest in Curly and caused jealousy in Laurey. When Jud became
        angry after losing the bidding to Curly and Laurey felt threatened by
        him, she promptly fired him. Curly came to her rescue by promising to
        protect her at her farmhouse, and offered both a kiss and a marriage
        proposal for Laurey - that she gladly accepted. Weeks later, Curly (now
        a farmer) and Laurey were married at the farmhouse. Marital festivities
        in the evening were disrupted by Jud, who set fire to two haystacks (threatening
        Curly and Laurey's lives atop one of them), and drew a knife on Curly
        - similar to Laurey's fears in an earlier dream. After Curly jumped toward
        Jud from the top of the flaming haystack, Jud accidentally fell onto
        his own knife and was instantly killed. The next morning, a brief makeshift
        trial held in the kitchen of Aunt Eller's farmhouse quickly declared
        Curly not guilty (for acting in self-defense), and Laurey and Curly departed
        with a large escorting contingent to the Claremore train station just
        in time for their honeymoon - riding in a fancy surrey. </font></p></td>

              126 minutes, D: Carl Theodor Dreyer<br />
              Carl Theodor Dreyer's beautifully-photographed, pretentious, serious-minded,
              fantasy supernatural religious drama (translated &quot;The Word&quot;)
              contained much intellectual debate about faith, life, death, and
              love. It mostly told of the clash within Christianity between orthodox
              (or organized) religion and true or personal religious faith. The
              film was set in August of 1925 in the rural Danish farm countryside
              of Jutland. It followed the life of the prosperous Borgen family
              led by its traditionalist, stern and prominent patriarch - Morten
              Borgen (Henrik Malberg) who had three Borgen sons (in descending
              order of age): Mikkel (with wife Inger), Johannes, and young Anders.
              Morten Borgen - the white-bearded, widowed, devout, joyless, Lutheran
              father was a somber and curmudgeonly member of the religious establishment.
              The eldest son Mikkel Borgen (Emil Hass Christensen) was 
              anti-religious and an unbeliever-agnostic. He had been married
              to his religious, kind-hearted wife Inger Borgen (Birgitte Federspiel)
              for 8 years, who was very pregnant with a third child. She shared
              religious views with her father-in-law Morten, but not with her
              husband. The middle son Johannes Borgen (Preben Lerdorff Rye) was
              an &quot;incurably mad&quot; and demented 27 year-old theology
              student, and the black sheep of the family who after intense study
              and the reading of Soren Kierkegaard's writings, became crazy 
              and began to believe that he was the resurrected Jesus Christ of
              Nazareth. The youngest son Anders Borgen (Cay Kristiansen) was regarded
              as emotionally-weak, and disobedient because of his love for Anne
              Petersen (Gerda Nielsen) - the silent and dutiful daughter of pious
              shopkeeper-tailor Peter Petersen (Ejnar Federspiel) and his wife
              Kirstin Petersen (Sylvia Eckhausen). The Petersen and Borgen families
              were rivals due to their differing beliefs -  the Petersens were
              strict, religious fundamentalists (a non-conformist, unconventional
              or exclusionary, revivalist sectarian group known as Inner Mission)
              who rigorously and dogmatically advocated extreme and personal
              religious conversion, 'fire and brimstone' sermons, and emotional
              prostration before God.  The Borgens' traditional
              Lutheranism violently clashed with  the Petersens' fundamentalism.
              Morten Borgen attempted to persuade Peter Petersen to allow his
              daughter Anne to marry Borgen's son Anders, but Peter refused on
              the grounds that Anders (and his father) weren't Christians. Inger
              suddenly became very sick due to her difficult pregnancy. She delivered
              a stillborn baby, but survived the ordeal. However, although Inger
              was recovering nicely and it was expected that she would survive,
              she died due to complications, and it was a stunning shock, mostly
              to Mikkel and Morten. A religious funeral service was held in her
              honor and the whole community came together at the Borgen farm.
              Just before the funeral ceremony, Peter reconciled with Morten
              at the side of Inger's open coffin, and agreed to his daughter
              Anne's marriage to Morten's son Anders. After  Johannes unexpectedly
              arrived at the funeral ceremony (and seemed to have lost his delusions),
               he asked quizzically about why everyone's faith hadn't been used
              to try to bring back Inger.  With the support of the childlike faith
              of  Inger's young daughter Maren (Ann Elisabeth Rud), who 
              believed that he could miraculously restore Inger, Johannes performed
              an amazing miracle. Johannes'
              words miraculously resurrected Inger from the dead. As she came to
              life in her open coffin, she unclasped her joined hands, slowly
              opened her eyes, and kissed her husband Mikkel during an embrace.
              She realized, with tears in her eyes, that the miracle had brought
              new-found faith to her agnostic husband. The miracle of resurrection
              had also united, healed and reconciled the patriarchs of the two
              families: Morten Borgen and Peter Petersen. </font></p></td>

                Panchali)</strong>, 115 minutes, D: Satyajit Ray<br />
Indian director Satyajit Ray's first film, the low-budget, visually-poetic, coming-of-age
drama (the greatest Indian film of all-time), was the first of an &quot;Apu
Trilogy.&quot; It presented  a rambling but realistic portrayal
            (or &quot;slice-of-life&quot;) of low-class poverty in India - backed
        by sitar ragas of famed Ravi Shankar. The film displayed the poverty-stricken
            lives of a small Brahmin family in the impoverished,
              rural Bengal village of Nischindipur beginning in the year 1910
        through the 1920s. The head of the household in the rural village was
              Harihar &quot;Hari&quot; Ray (Kanu Bannerjee) - a well-intentioned
              dreamer (an aspiring playwright and poet) and part-time Hindu temple
        priest (<i>pujari</i>), but a passive husband and terrible provider.
        His overworked, self-sacrificing, depressed and harried wife Sarbojaya
        Ray (Karuna Bannerjee) was worried about their deep poverty.  Their
        young daughter, 6 year-old Little Durga (Runki Banerjee as young girl)
        was observed in the household's compound with  an elderly, stooped-backed,
        toothless, wrinkled crone - Hari's penniless, story-telling sister
        - Aunt Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Devi), who did nothing to discourage
        the young and naughty Durga from stealing fruit from the wealthy neighbor's
        (the Mukherjees) mango-guava fruit grove and garden. After their
            youngest child, Apu (Subir Banerjee) was joyfully born into the family,
             the film jumped ahead to six years later, as small-framed Apu and
            his free-spirited older sister Durga (Uma Das Gupta as older) often
        played together. The film surveyed the progression of simple daily
            life and survival, including meal preparation, the children as mischievous
        playmates who sometimes squabbled with each other, and experienced  
        the world together. Problems arose when Durga was accused of stealing
            a beaded necklace from  the daughter of their rich Mukherjee
        neighbors, but she denied it. In the film's most sublime moment, the
        two siblings ran a long distance through an adjacent meadow of tall grass
        and rice fields. Along the way, they stopped to listen to the humming
        sound of electrical power in an energy grid tower. They came upon distant
        railway tracks to await the thundering roar and whistling of an approaching
        train. They watched in awe and were thrilled to see a big steam engine
        pass by (a symbol of promise and a more modern world of the future).
        Parallel to this narrative part of the story, Sarbojaya had cast the
        Auntie out of the household. A few days later, the old woman 
              returned to the family home, not feeling well, to live out her
              last days: (&quot;I'd like to spend my last days in the old home&quot;),
              but was again heartlessly ordered to leave by Sarbojaya (who
        watched without saying goodbye). As the happy children returned home
              on their way back from viewing the train, they discovered their
        Auntie's slumped-over dead body in the forest. The next day, the family's
        head of household Harihar Ray departed, promising to find work, but was
              forced to continue to search for work farther away  (relayed
              through a postcard to his wife). Hari   was absent for many months
        without any communication with his family.  The impoverished Sarbojaya
              became desperate for food and was forced to pawn off her dowry
        kitchenware. And then there came news that Hari was soon returning home
              with money. A torrential, destructive and deadly monsoon rain 
                flooded the landscape, and brought a lethal chill of pneumonia
              to Durga after she impulsively played too long outside during the
              initial downpour. As the storm continued, she became very ill 
        in the midst of whistling winds and lightning flashes, and soon died
              in her mother's arms. The next day, Hari returned
          home after being long-overdue - coming back after
        five months of seeking work, with many gifts for his somber wife. When
            he handed her the gift of a new sari for Durga, she
            sobbed and sank to the ground clutching the  gift. In
            the film's most eloquent wordless, grieving moment, Hari realized
        that his daughter Durga had died in his absence. In the film's conclusion
              set a few days later, the family was packing up - forced to move
              and make a bittersweet departure from Hari's ancestral home (of
              three generations) to the city of Benares to find better living
        conditions. Just before the family's departure in an ox-cart, Apu found
              the beaded necklace that Durga said she hadn't stolen. To cover
              up her theft and discard the evidence, Apu threw it into the nearby
        pond water where it was submerged and concealed under the algae. The
              family was headed for an uncertain future in Benares
              and the ghat on the Ganges River referenced earlier where priests
        could make money by singing and reciting from the scriptures.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><strong>The Phenix City Story (1955)</strong>, 100
              minutes, D: Phil Karlson<br />
              Director Phil Karlson's documentary-styled, taut and graphically-violent
              film noir - a muckracking, neo-realistic crime docu-drama from
              Allied Artists and  a tabloid-like, low-budget B-movie shot on
              location, although fictionalized, was based upon real-life events
              leading to the National Guard's martial law takeover of an organized
              crime-ridden Southern town in 1954. Its screenplay by Daniel Mainwaring
              and Crane Wilbur was undoubtedly sensational. Karlson went
              on to helm a similar vigilante-themed cult classic set in the South
        - the box-office hit <i>Walking Tall (1973)</i>.  A 15-minute
        opening preface of <i>cinema verite</i> was composed of interviews by
        real-life reporter Clete Roberts (as Himself) of  actual principal
        local characters. The setting was Alabama's evil 'sin city' of Phenix
              City (located around 14th Street), centering on &quot;The Poppy
              Club&quot; known for corrupt card games (with marked cards), rigged
              gambling and slot machines, prostitution, murder, drinking, and
              other vices catering to soldiers from  nearby Fort Benning Army
        Base (in Columbus, GA) across the Chattahoochee River.  The affable local
              mobster boss of the syndicate named Rhett Tanner (Edward Andrews)
              was often surrounded by goons and lackeys, including his brutish
        henchmen Clem Wilson (John Larch). Violence and racism commenced with
        the murder of the young daughter of African-American Zeke Ward (James
              Edwards) who worked as a janitor at the Club. Her body was threateningly
              thrown onto the front lawn of anti-crime, crusading reformist State
              Attorney General candidate Albert L. &quot;Pat&quot; Patterson
              (John McIntire). Vigilante  violence climaxed with many intimidations
              and beatings of innocent citizens (those who supported the town's
        new citizens' committee against corruption). After the girl's murder
              and other violent acts, Pat's returning veteran-son and crusading
              lawyer John Patterson (Richard Kiley) delivered
              a stirring motivational speech outside, across the street from
        the Poppy Club, to rally the good citizens in town. Albert &quot;Pat&quot; Patterson,
              who had finally been persuaded by his son to reform the corrupt
              conditions in town, ran for office and had just been narrowly nominated
              (by only a thousand votes) as the Democratic Party's candidate
        for Attorney General. Viewed as a threat by the mob, Pat was
          point-blank gunned down (assassinated by two of Tanner's henchmen)
        as he entered his car outside his law office.  The murder was witnessed
              by young, Poppy Club blackjack card dealer Ellie Rhodes (Kathryn
              Grant), an upright good girl who hated gambling and crime and possessed
              a moral conscience (and was a potential informant). In the film's
              ending, John Patterson found Ellie dead - murdered
        by Tanner. The film concluded with John (with a bloodied, sweaty
            face) calling the Governor in the state capital on the phone. He
            encouraged a frenzied mob outside to cheer loudly so that the Governor
            would be convinced to clean up Phenix City. He received a promise
            from the Governor - the National Guard would  be sent in to establish
            martial law, occupy the town, and dismantle and destroy (by fire)
            the Poppy Club's gambling equipment and slot machines, and shut down
        the underground casinos. Later, he was elected Attorney General
              in place of his dead father, and vowed that he would attempt to
        uphold justice. </font></p></td>

          Columbia Pictures' big box-office CinemaScopic hit, a romantic drama,
              was based upon William Inge's 1953 Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway
              stage play (adapted by Daniel Taradash). It told about the effects
            of the arrival of a virile drifter on various females in a small
            mid-1950s Kansas town during a Labor Day celebration. In the plot,
              unemployed, egotistical, bravado-filled, charming drifter Hal Carter
              (William Holden) arrived in a small Kansas town on the holiday
              of Labor Day to visit his ex-fraternity brother and friend Alan
              Benson (Cliff Robertson), the son of the wealthiest man in town
              - grain industrialist Mr. Benson (Raymond Bailey). Presumably,
              he had come to find a job with Alan - and although he dreamed of
              being successful, he would have to start out in an entry-level
              position. At first, he performed yard work for elderly widow Helen
              Potts (Verna Felton) in exchange for a morning meal. Working with
              his shirt off outdoors, he caught the attention of a neighbor -
              19 year-old dime-store clerk Marjorie &quot;Madge&quot; Owens
              (Kim Novak), Alan's red-haired girlfriend. Others who noticed him
              were Madge's  single mother Flo Owens (Betty Field), Madge's
              smart, younger tomboyish sister Millie Owens (Susan Strasberg)
              (a college-bound HS senior), and aging, &quot;old maid&quot; schoolteacher
              Miss Rosemary Sydney (Rosalind Russell), a boarder at the Owens'
              next-door house. As the town beauty, Madge stood before a mirror,
              while her worried and anxious mother Flo continually encouraged
              her to get married to her boyfriend Alan before her time passed.
              Alan worshipped and idolized Madge, who was dissatisfied with just
              looking pretty and always being complimented as beautiful. Meanwhile,
              Rosemary was in a relationship with mild-mannered, bachelor store
              owner Howard Bevans (Oscar-nominated Arthur O'Connell) and was
              desperate to get married. Everyone in town attended the quintessential,
              All-American annual Kansas town's Labor Day picnic in Riverside
              Park. Hal attended with Alan and Madge's sister Millie
            as his 'date.' At the picnic (with games,
            food and other activities), Madge was elected as the picnic's Queen
            of Neewollah (Halloween spelled backwards). Later in the evening
            after the sun had set, with incredible camera work (by James Wong
            Howe), Madge  (in billowing pink) approached toward
            the sexy-looking Hal on a boat dock landing under colorful Japanese
            lanterns. She took over from Millie as the camera circled
            around their sensual slow &quot;mating&quot; dance to the tune
            of &quot;Moonglow.&quot; The sight of Hal and Madge together upset
            Flo (she thought it would jeopardize her daughter's marital future
            with Alan) and also was concerning to the  drunken and jealous Rosemary.
            After Hal's dance with Madge, Rosemary forced herself onto
            Hal for a dance, while admiring his physique. When Hal   
            rejected her and pushed her away and his shirt was torn, she
            turned on him and bitterly derided him for ignoring his 'date'
            Millie (who had become drunk) while he was going after pretty-looking
            Madge. After the embarrassing incident at the picnic dance, the
            distraught  Rosemary pathetically and shamelessly grabbed
            onto the overwhelmed Howard on her porch and begged him: &quot;You
            gotta marry me, Howard.&quot; (As the film was ending,  she basically
            brow-beat Howard into acquiescing to her demands to be married.)
            Upset by everything, including Alan's mean attempt to get him
            arrested on charges of car theft, Hal became very angry 
            and departed from the picnic. Madge followed him and they drove
            to the town's train station, where he threatened to leave on the
            next freight train. They had a heart-to-heart talk about his failed
            life beginning when he was a boy in a reform school/jail. His confessions
            brought an encouraging kiss from Madge (alongside the rail tracks).
            She also told him: &quot;I get so tired of just being told I'm
            pretty&quot; - it was the start of a romantic relationship between
            them. By morning, in the film's final scene before jumping onto a
            passing train, Hal kissed Madge goodbye at the Owens house as he
            professed his love for her, before leaving for Tulsa to work as a
            hotel bell-hop. He tried to persuade Madge to follow after him. Madge
            was conflicted about what to do - Flo told her not to go but to remain
            and marry Alan, while Millie encouraged her to follow her heart: &quot;Go
            with him, Madge....For once in your life, do something right.&quot; Would
            she pursue a man whom she had known for only one day, and who had
            not been successful for most of his life? The film concluded with
            a determined Madge quickly packing her suitcase and boarding a Tulsa-bound
            bus, followed by an amazing aerial helicopter shot of Madge's bus
            following Hal's freight train - eventually catching up and going
          in the same direction at the same speed.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Nicholas Ray<br />
          Director Nicholas Ray's classic, melodramatic &quot;Romeo and Juliet'
          tale was mostly a story of rebellion and angst in the life of an unsettled,
          often-uprooted, teenaged, new-kid-in-town - over a 24-30 hour period.
          It was the second of anti-hero James Dean's three career films and
          the best 50s film of its kind regarding the generation gap, troubled
          and confused 50s youth and juvenile delinquency. Other contemporary
          films included <a href="wild.html"><i>The
          Wild One (1954)</i></a> and <i>The Blackboard Jungle (1955). </i>In          the
          opening sequence set in the lobby of a Los Angeles police station late
          at night, the three main teenaged characters (all alienated, outcast
          and misfit youth who lacked
              a solid male or 'father' role model) crossed paths and were introduced:
          troublemaker Jim Stark (James Dean) had been arrested for public drunkenness
          after being found lying on a sidewalk curb with a wind-up toy monkey
          next to him; pretty but unloved 16 year-old Judy (Natalie Wood) in
          a bright-red outfit with matching red lipstick had been cited for curfew
          violation and was thought at first to be a streetwalker; and emotionally-disturbed,
          anguished 'orphan' John &quot;Plato&quot; 
            Crawford (Sal Mineo) who had been abandoned by his neglectful and
            irresponsible parents and was being cared for by the family's black
            housekeeper-maid (Marietta Canty), and had recently killed a litter
            of puppies.  <font size="2"> Judy
          delivered a &quot;dirty tramp&quot; speech to patient, sympathetic
          juvenile-offenders officer Ray Fremick (Edward C. Platt) about her
          father's cruelty when she dressed up with lipstick, and he
          resisted and reproached her grown-up maturity. Arrangements were made
          for Judy's mother to pick her up, causing Judy even more emotional
          distress. Jim's often-bickering and love-smothering middle-to-upper
          class parents arrived to pick him up -  his ineffectual,
          hen-pecked, milquetoast father Mr. Frank Stark (James Backus, the voice
          of the cartoon character <i>Mr.
            Magoo</i>) and his mother Carol Stark (Ann Doran).  
            Jim  expressed his alienated, frustrated rage and agony
          at them when he screamed: &quot;You're tearing me apart!&quot; In
          officer Ray's office, Jim's bottled up energy caused him to box bare-knuckled
          with Ray's large wooden desk, venting his pent-up crazed energy, and
          then continuing with a description of his dysfunctional
          family. Jim also expressed a wish that his &quot;chicken&quot; father
          (a weak and timid role model) would one day stand up to his domineering
          mother who was only concerned about keeping up an image of respectability. </font>On  his
          first day in a new high school, Dawson High, Jim was treated with contempt
          by his neighbor Judy's  leather-jacketed
            boyfriend Buzz Gunderson (Corey Allen) and his rowdy gang of cohorts,
          including Goon (Dennis Hopper) and Moose (Nick Adams). Later
          in the day during a science field trip to the Griffith Observatory,
          after a planetarium show, HS newcomer Jim engaged in a choreographed,
          tense switchblade knife-fight with Buzz outside, and then the two challenged
          each other to participate in a deadly drag race (&quot;chickie run&quot;)
          that evening. In  their homes that same day after
          school, both Judy and Jim experienced family tensions - Jim was embarrassed
              by his father's indecisiveness, lack of understanding and weak-willed
              cowardice, while Judy was scolded by her insensitive and sexist
          father when she tried to kiss him. The sea-side cliff challenge
              competition (known as a &quot;chickie run&quot;) in cars between
              Jim and Buzz suddenly and tragically turned lethal when Buzz became
              trapped inside his stolen hot-rod car by his jacket sleeve, and
              his vehicle plunged over the edge of the cliff and he was killed.
              Jim extended his hand to Judy and touched her fingertips and then
              took her hand, while Plato stood in the background
          between them; drawn together, Jim drove both of them home. He wished
          to appeal to his parents for support following the tragedy of Buzz's
              death because he was &quot;in trouble,&quot; but his weak-willed, powerless
              and impotently indecisive father first wanted Jim to not get involved
              and then his mother refused to have him go to the police. She even
              suggested that he just not &quot;volunteer&quot;  information
              about what happened, or that they move away again to get away from
              the problem. Jim contemptuously left his home and found Judy near
              his driveway, where she apologized to him for her earlier treatment
              of him, and under a moonlit sky, he kissed her for the first time.
               The outcast and misfit trio of juveniles
               formed a strong bond against both their insensitive parents (completely
               unjust, dysfunctional, ineffectual, or callous) and their peers,
               as they searched for their identities. In
               particular, Plato came to look upon Jim and Judy as his married
               'surrogate' parents.</font> <font size="2">The threesome  (acting
               as a &quot;family&quot; with Jim and Judy pretending to be a married couple)
               met up to find refuge and solace together for the night while
               exploring and touring an abandoned and deserted mansion (with
               an empty swimming pool) near the observatory. Settling  
               down for the night, Judy opened her heart to Jim in a very intimate
               sequence as they fell in love. In the final tragic, senseless
               and violent finale, Plato (who thought Jim and Judy had deserted
               him) was forced to flee from the mansion after being assaulted
               by Buzz's vengeful gang. With his mother's hand-gun, Plato shot
               one of the gang members, and then fled toward the observatory,
               where he was also pursued by police after he had fired at them.
               Alerts brought Plato&rsquo;s
               housekeeper, juvenile officer Ray and Jim's parents to the
               scene, as well as Jim and Judy. To calm
               him and in an attempt to disarm Plato, Jim traded his red jacket
               for Plato's gun (and was able to secretly remove the bullets before
               returning the gun). At dawn,  Plato panicked when caught in a
               spotlight and rushed out of the observatory - appearing to be
               armed when he rushed at the police foolishly brandishing his gun
               (unloaded), and was shot down and killed. Jim tried to protect
               his friend, but failed. He called out with his arm outstretched: &quot;I
              got the bullets, look!&quot;  Feeling powerless after Plato was
              struck down, the distraught Jim knelt down and crawled next to
              his friend's dead body, mourning over the loss of his surrogate
              'son' who was unable to reach the adult world - he asked Plato: &quot;Hey
              jerk-pot. What did ya do that for?&quot; At the same time, Jim's
              father promised to be a stronger and more dependable father for
              Jim, and the two embraced. The disconsolate words of Plato's family's
              distraught black housekeeper provided an epitaph for the film's
              sacrificial lamb: &quot;This poor
              baby got nobody. Just nobody.&quot; Now reconciled
              with his parents  and accepted as a newly-initiated adult, Jim
              introduced Judy to them and they drove off together as the new
              day dawned. </font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Richard III (1955, UK)</b>, 161 minutes, D: Laurence Olivier</font><br />
          <font size="2">This Technicolored British film
              adaptation of Shakespeare's play, <i>King Richard III</i> was directed,
              produced, scripted, and co-produced by its lead star, Laurence
              Olivier, who was nominated (it was his 5th of 10 career acting
              nominations) for the title role of the dastardly and nasty Duke
              who eventually plotted to become England's monarch. It was Olivier's
              third and oft-praised Shakespearean film - and most recently considered
        his finest work. The first scene was of
              the English coronation ceremony to crown Edward
              IV (Cedric Hardwicke) as the new King of England. Attendees 
              included Edward's two younger brothers: Richard - Duke of Gloucester
              (Laurence Olivier), and George - Duke of Clarence (John
        Gielgud), and a cousin: the Duke of Buckingham (Ralph Richardson). Edward
              IV was married to Queen Elizabeth (Mary Kerridge), and they had
              two children: young Edward, Prince of Wales (Paul Huson) and the
        Young Duke of York (Andy Shine). Immediately after the coronation, Richard
              delivered - directly toward the audience and camera - his famous
              soliloquy about his jealous feelings concerning his older brother's
        rise to power and the coming of peace: (&quot;Now is the winter of our discontent...&quot;).
              Richard also spoke about his human deformities (a limp, a hunchback
        and a withered arm and hand). The
            scheming, ruthless and manipulative Richard explained - carefully
            and calculatingly - how he was devising a complex plan of deception
            and violent death to reach his objective - to obtain the English
        crown for himself. Richard also had plans to wed widowed Lady
            Anne (Claire Bloom), the former Princess of Wales who was still
        in mourning and was cursing Richard who had lethally stabbed her
        husband Edward - Prince of Wales. She succumbed to him and accepted his
        offer of a ring, a kiss and marriage.  Richard's plot was  to eliminate
              all of his competition - the heirs to the throne, beginning with  his
        first victim - his own brother George. The elderly and exhausted
        King Edward IV died shortly after hearing of George's death. The new
              princely heirs to the throne - King Edward IV's young son Edward
              who was briefly King Edward V, and the boy's young brother the
        Duke of York - were detained in the Tower of London. The Lord Chamberlain
              - Lord Hastings (Alec Clunes) was accused of unfounded claims of
        traitorous conspiracy, arrested  and soon beheaded. Richard's  corrupt
              cousin Duke of Buckingham appealed to the people to promote
        Richard as the next monarch, and Richard was able
        to usurp the Crown and make himself King. Richard immediately
        proposed murdering the doomed young male-heirs to the throne, and Richard
               was also maneuvering to report that his wife Queen Anne had died,
              so that he could marry his deceased brother King Edward's daughter
        Elizabeth. Concerned about Richard's sanity and autocratic rule, the
              Duke of Buckingham fled and joined forces of opposition led by
              Henry Tudor (Stanley Baker) the Earl of Richmond, but later was
              captured by Richard's forces and beheaded. The two young princes
              were smothered to death while sleeping together in the same bed
              inside the Tower. Richard's armed forces within the House of York
              became pitted against the military might of the House of Lancaster,
              led by Henry Tudor. Before the major conflict on Bosworth Field,
              Richard experienced &quot;fearful dream&quot;-nightmares in his
              tent of his victims in the form of ghosts - brother George, his
        two nephews, Lord Hastings, and his wife Anne. During the conflict, two
              of Richard's horses were lost - and basically
            defenseless and on foot, he desperately cried out: &quot;A horse,
        a horse, my kingdom for a horse.&quot; Surrounded by  Lancastarian
        troops, Richard was attacked and fatally wounded. Richard's  
        lost crown was found in a thorn bush by Lord Stanley (Laurence Naismith),
        and then was held up and offered to Henry Tudor - to crown him and
        restore peace and safety to England as Henry VII.</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>The Rose Tattoo (1955)</b>, 117 minutes, D: Daniel
            Mann<br />
        Director Daniel Mann's black and white romantic melodrama was an overwrought
        adaptation of legendary playwright Tennessee Williams' 3-act play that
        premiered in 1950-51. It marked the first English-speaking role in a
        Hollywood film for the Best Actress Oscar-winning actress Anna Magnani.
        There were two other Academy Awards, for Best B/W Art Direction and Best
        B/W Cinematography (James Wong Howe). In the plot, buxom Sicilian-American
        seamstress Serafina Delle Rose (Anna Magnani) was living in New Orleans,
        LA on the Gulf Coast with her handsome, robust and virile truck-driving
        husband the &quot;Baron&quot; Rosario Delle Rose (Larry Chance), and
        was pregnant with their second child. She was unaware that her beloved
        Rosario was being unfaithful with blonde and slutty blackjack dealer
        Estelle Hohengarten (Virginia Grey) at the local Mardi Gras Club, who
        had recently had a rose tattooed on her chest (matching her husband's).
        After Serafina's husband was killed in an accident during a smuggling
        run as he attempted to evade police, she was devastated and withdrew
        from the world. While mourning and grieving, she also miscarried her
        unborn child. Serafina placed her husband's cremated ashes in a marble
        urn on a shelf (in violation of her Catholic faith) below her small
        Virgin Mary statue. During the next three years, the melancholy Serafina
        became disconnected from everything as a disheveled and frowsy recluse
        in her own home, with her hair in disarray. She was often not fully-dressed
        and clad only in a slip. When she learned that her &quot;sweet
        and refined&quot; 18 year-old teenaged daughter Rosa (Marisa Pavan) had
        fallen for virginal, boyish-faced sailor Jack Hunter (Ben Cooper) at
        about the time she was to graduate from HS, the embittered Serafina revolted
            against the world and treated her daughter with severe discipline.
        She vindictively locked a collection of graduation dresses she had sewn
        for Rosa and her classmates inside her house. Serafina's belief system
        about her loving husband collapsed when she was told by two floozy customers
        that her husband had been unfaithful for a year with Estelle from the
        Mardi Gras Club. In disbelief, Serafina tossed them out of her house.
        She then became suspicious of Rosa's association with Jack and his possible
        sexual intentions toward her. Serafina forced Jack to ritualistically
        bow to the Virgin Mary and swear not to take advantage of the innocent
        Rosa. The film's turning point came after Serafina became acquainted
        with dumb, simple-minded, boisterous, carefree, clownish and good-hearted
        Sicilian truck driver Alvaro Mangiacavallo (Burt Lancaster) who transported
        bananas, but was fired from his job when he lost track of time getting
        acquainted with Serafina in her home. [Note: In many ways, he was a reincarnation
        of her deceased husband.] When he visited her a second time in the evening
        of the same day, he removed his shirt to reveal that he had a rose tattooed
        on his chest similar to the one her husband Rosario had, in order to
        impress her and prove his affection for her. She was sickened, and then
        upset when he forced himself on her and she angrily ordered:
        &quot;Go home! Don't touch me!&quot;; he apologized for making a mistake
        and told her: &quot;We should have been friends. I think maybe we meet
        on the wrong day.&quot; After learning that Alvaro
        was acquainted with Rosario's alleged mistress Estelle, she demanded
        to be taken to the Mardi Gras Club to confront her. The
        defiant Estelle proudly confessed to her affair and publically showed
        off her rose tattoo, and was promptly slapped. When Serafina returned
        home, she smashed the urn containing Rosario's ashes. She 
        told Alvaro to leave, but then privately  invited him to come
        back later. However, when the drunken Alvaro
        finally arrived  to the awaiting and expectant Serafina, he passed
          out on the floor. That same evening, Rosa and
          Jack had decided to elope and get married in the lobby of his New Orleans
          hotel at noon the next day before he shipped out at 5 pm. The
          next morning, Alvaro awoke and mistakenly thought that Serafina was
          sleeping on the couch, and approached to kiss her - without touching
          her. Rosa screamed, alerting Serafina who rushed in and thought Rosa
          was being assaulted; she angrily slapped Alvaro and threw him out of
          the house. To Rosa, she tried to cover up the fact that she knew the
          man: (&quot;I closed my eyes and dreamed he was your father&quot;);
          Rosa accused her mother of hypocritical lying: &quot;The only thing
          worse than a liar is a liar that's also a hypocrite!&quot; Jack suddenly
          arrived and the couple revealed their intentions to marry. Serafina
          realized she must finally assent to her stifled and rebellious daughter's
          grown-up wishes and give the young couple her blessing: (&quot;Go with
          the boy&quot;),
          and they rushed off to catch the train to New Orleans. In
          the film's contrived happy conclusion, she also heard a shirtless Alvaro
          shouting to her from outside the house from the top of a boat mast,
          and asking for her forgiveness and love. She responded
          by openly offering him the silk shirt and  re-inviting him
          back into her home after being won over by his romantic persistence;
          she implied that they could easily reconcile and be back together:
          &quot;Now we can go on with our conversation, hmm?&quot; </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Billy Wilder<br />
           Director/co-writer Billy Wilder's romantic sex comedy
          was a witty and farcical tale adapted from George Axelrod's 1952 Broadway
          play. In the film's opening, paperback publisher and middle-aged Manhattanite
          Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) escorted his wife Helen (Evelyn Keyes)
          and son Ricky (Butch Bernard) to the train station; they were on their
          way to Maine for the summer to escape the city's heat. A light-headed,
          gorgeous, shapely and voluptuous upstairs neighbor - The Girl (Marilyn
          Monroe as a quintessential blonde), who had forgotten her outer building
          key, met her married New Yorker neighbor Richard Sherman when she hit
          his buzzer to get in, allowing her entrance to the upstairs apartment
          above his that she had rented for the summer. After seven years of
          marriage to his wife Helen, Richard - who was
          often prone to fantasy, bragged about how he was immune to the
          'seven year itch' phenomenon of extra-marital affairs by repressed
          men, and then  told his wife Helen about three  seduction
          scenarios that he claimed he had resisted. After the Girl nearly hit
          Richard from her balcony above with a dislodged tomato plant, he invited
          her down to have a cool drink. Richard fantasized seducing the Girl
          by playing Rachmaninoff's <i>2nd Piano Concerto</i>, although in reality,
          she ignored his attempt and was uninterested. However, she joyously
          joined him on the piano bench to play <i>Chopsticks</i> - the two ended
          up on the floor when he attempted to approach his musical partner with
          a romantically-snooty Charles Boyer-like accent: &quot;...now I'm going
          to take you in my arms and kiss you, very quickly and very hard.&quot; One
          of filmdom's most iconic and immortal sexual poses was found in this
          film - after attending a movie, <i>The Creature From the Black Lagoon</i>,
          the Girl posed in a white dress flying and billowing up around her
          knees -  spread-legged and astride a New York subway
          vent as moving trains below blew and lifted her
          dress upwards above her legs with a rush of air: &quot;Oh, do you feel
          the breeze from the subway. Isn't it delicious?&quot; Afterwards, she
          told him that she was filming a Dazzledent TV commercial the next day.
          Trusting in him entirely, he easily tricked her into kissing him by
          saying that he doubted the truth of the commercials and the promise
          of flawless breath. When they returned home, Sherman agreed to let
          her sleep in his air-conditioned bedroom, while he slept on the living
              room couch; however, due to Sherman's paranoia about being spotted
              with her in the apartment, he sent her back to her
            own apartment, feeling neurotic and guilt-ridden, but soon, she returned
               through a trap-door passageway from upstairs. The next morning
              while the Girl was in the shower and he prepared breakfast, Sherman
          continued to fantasize that Helen had returned home early after learning
          about his dalliances. His wife peppered the front door with bullets,
          and entered brandishing a gun and shot at him. In the film's conclusion,
          Sherman decided to spend two weeks on vacation in Maine and join Helen
          and Ricky. He gave the Girl the key to his place, and before he left,
          the Girl sent him off with a big kiss goodbye: &quot;I have a message
          for your wife. (A kiss.) Don't wipe it off. If she thinks that's cranberry
              sauce, tell her she's got cherry pits in her head.&quot; 
          The Girl implied that a little jealousy on Helen's part would make
          her more aware of his sex appeal to other women. </font></p></td>

                Sommarnattens Leende)</strong>, 108 minutes, D: Ingmar Bergman<br />
                Director Ingmar Bergman's light comedy of manners and bedroom
                farce was based upon Shakespeare's <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream, </i>and
                the inspiration for Woody Allen's <i>A Midsummer Night's Sex
                Comedy (1982)</i>. The ensemble film featured many characters
                mixed up in their romantic relationships, mostly involving adultery
                and infidelity, with the tagline: &quot;A Sexy Frolic About the
                Sport of Love.&quot; Set in Sweden at the turn of the century
                (late 1800s) over a period of days, it told about a number of
                pretentious upper-class, mismatched couples and characters (a
                lawyer, a virgin, an actress, a soldier, a Countess, a priest,
                the maid, the servant, etc.) in various ribald adventures and
                couplings. In the film's opening, middle-aged 50-ish lawyer Fredrik
                Egerman (Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand)
                had been married for two years to his much younger, beautiful
                and naive 19 year-old wife Anne (Ulla Jacobsson), who had not
                yet given up her virginity. Living with him in the same household,
                Fredrik had a grown-up son from a former marriage (to his deceased
                wife) named Henrik Egerman (Bj&ouml;rn
                Bjelfvenstam), a tormented, repressed, idealistic celibate man
                in his 20s who was a theology student studying for the priesthood.
                As the film opened, Fredrik (with his young wife Anne) was about
                to attend an evening's theatrical performance starring his old
                flame Desiree; while napping with Anne in the afternoon, Fredrik
                happened to mention Desiree's name in his sleep, causing her
                some insecurity. [Background: After his first
                wife died and before he married Anne, Fredrik had taken a mistress
                - beautiful, witty and famous 50-ish blonde stage actress Desiree
                Armfeldt (Eva Dahlbeck), but eventually broke off their
                relationship.] During her theatrical performance, Desiree
                delivered a monologue (appearing to seductively speak directly
                at Fredrik), and her words appeared to disturb Anne, who asked
                to go home early. Although Henrik loved his pretty step-mother
                Anne (who was about his same age), he couldn't resist the flirtatious
                advances of Fredrik's sexy young 18 year-old servant-maid Petra
                (Harriet Andersson); although not in love with Petra, Henrik
                experienced sex for the first time with her (while Anne and Fredrik
                were at the theatre). Guilt-ridden about losing his virtue, he
                also admitted that he couldn't perform: (&quot;We
                have sinned, but we failed&quot;), but that she was forgiving.
                Afterwards when everyone was asleep that night, Fredrik snuck
                out of his house and secretly met with Desiree in her backstage
                dressing room, to ask her for guidance about his marital problems
                with Anne (&quot;I've been married to Anne for two years
                and she's still pristine&quot;). On their way walking 
				to Desiree's house for a glass of wine, Fredrik
                fell into a large puddle, and Desiree offered him another
                man's frilly night-gown and night-cap to wear. It was revealed
                that Desiree had a 4 year-old son whom she named Fredrik after
                Frederick the Great (he was presumably older Fredrik's illegitimate
                son). The owner of the night-garments unexpectedly arrived to
                confront Fredrik - he was Desiree's current flame of six months
                in an open relationship - an insanely-jealous, egotistical lover-suitor
                Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm (Jarl Kulle) and domineering, aristocratic
                military officer, who was married to Countess Charlotte Malcolm
                (Margit Carlqvist), one of Anne's good friends; the Count intimidated
                Fredrik with a dueling challenge: (&quot;Do you like duels?...
                I've dueled 18 times. Pistol, epee, foil, bow and arrow, shotgun.
                I've only been injured six times&quot;), before Fredrik
          was humiliatingly ordered to leave (wearing only his own undergarments);
          soon after, the Count and Desiree decided to quit their relationship.
                The film's main weekend event that brought all the principal
                characters together was initiated by the manipulative Desiree,
                who coaxed her solitaire-playing mother Mrs. Armfeldt (Naima
                Wifstrand) to invite the two married men (both recent lovers
                of Desiree): Fredrik (and Anne) with their maid Petra, and the
                Count (and the Countess), along with Henrik to her Ryarp country
                manor home. The Count's gossipy wife Charlotte (who had learned
                from her husband about Fredrik's secret  rendezvous with Desiree
                the night before) arrived for a brief visit with Anne; although
                there was no evidence of infidelity by Fredrik with Desiree,
                the Countess attempted to stir up trouble by telling Anne about
                Fredrik's previous night's escapades with Desiree; Charlotte
                also expressed her raging hate for her philandering husband and
          her jealous envy of Desiree's attractiveness to  men. Upon arriving
          at the Armfeldt estate for the weekend party, Petra met the estate's
          beer-drinking groom-servant Frid (&Aring;ke Fridell), who took an immediate
          interest in her: (&quot;You're a damn hot thing!&quot;); he demonstrated
          a button for her in Henrik's room that activated and opened up a secret
          bed compartment, and she exclaimed: &quot;I should have a bed like
          that!&quot; Once all the guests arrived for the traditional
              all-night &quot;Midsummer Night&quot; event held on the shortest
              night of the year, Desiree revealed to the Countess her ultimate
              plan: to restore Charlotte to her husband the Count, and to have
              Desiree separate Fredrik from Anne. During the opening dinner,
              a discussion about seduction commenced; Countess Charlotte made
              a public wager with her husband that she could seduce Fredrik away
              from Anne in 15 minutes. The guests were
              served food and a magical spiked wine potion or elixir to promote
              sensuality and seduction - with a mixture of a drop of a young
              woman's breast milk and a drop of semen from a young stallion.
              Afterwards early the next morning in reaction to some of the guests
              and immoral talk at dinner, Henrik had suicidal intentions to hang
              himself, but when his attempt failed, he accidentally hit the button
              that activated the secret compartment with an emerging bed. The
              conservative-minded step-son found himself alone with Anne sleeping
              on the bed (she had retired early) - after discovering her, he
              exclaimed: &quot;So
              I'm dead after all,&quot; and now feeling life-affirming, they
              pledged their love to each other, kissed, and made love (off-screen).
               [Note: Frid summarized for Petra what
            was happening to the various couples by explaining the &quot;three
            smiles&quot; that cycled during the summer night: (&quot;The summer
            night laughs three times&quot;): (1) at midnight - for passionate
            young lovers expressing romance with their hearts, exemplified by
            Henrik and Anne, (2) in the middle of the night - for &quot;the foolish,
            the simple-minded, the incorrigible,&quot; seen in Frid and Petra's
            relationship, and (3) at dawn - for &quot;the distressed and oppressed,
            the insomniacs, the deceived, the fearful, the lonely,&quot; referring
            to the Count and Countess, Fredrik and Desiree.]           During
            Frid's explanation, Henrik and Anne appeared and requested help from
            Petra and her new lover Frid to elope together; a dismayed Fredrik
            watched them from afar as they rode off in an open carriage, and
            Anne discarded her veil. Shortly later, Frid and Petra also became
            engaged. Meanwhile, in the garden pavilion, Countess Charlotte had
            a romantic rendezvous with the vulnerable Fredrik to fulfill the
            public wager she had made. She deliberately caused her jealous husband
            to barge in, separate them, and challenge Fredrik to a game of Russian
            roulette. The Count had devised a cruel trick for the challenge -
            the revolver was rigged with only harmless soot, to scare everyone.
            As the result of her success in seducing Fredrik, the Countess now
            demanded that the Count fulfill her wager's prize of a wish, and
            state his faithfulness to her: &quot;I'll be
            faithful to you for at least seven eternities of love, six feigned
            smiles, and 57 whispers of love. I remain faithful to you until the
            great abyss do us part. I'll stay true to you, in my way.&quot; Fredrik
            was humiliated for being used by both the Countess and Desiree,
            but was assured by Desiree that she would not abandon her old lover
              (&quot;I feel so sorry for you...I'm here&quot;). The film concluded
              with the dilemmas of the four pairs of lovers somewhat resolved,
              with some winners and some losers (changed partners, a reconciliation,
              and an elopement) - with &quot;three smiles&quot; on
            the faces of the protagonists: Henrik with Anne, the Count with
          the Countess, and Frid with his fiancee Petra. </font></p>          </td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Summertime (1955, UK/US)</b>, 100 minutes, D: David Lean<br />
          This romantic melodrama by director David Lean was a British film and
              travelogue about a bittersweet, late love in Italy between an unmarried,
              puritanical, lonely vacationing American secretary and a charming
              Venice shopkeeper. In the film's opening,
              single, repressed, independent-minded, middle-aged Ohio &quot;fancy
              secretary&quot; Jane Hudson (Katharine Hepburn) was on the Orient
              Express train from Paris to Venice, Italy (shot on location), on
              her way to visit the &quot;City of Romance&quot;; she had finally
              saved up enough money to take a long-awaited 3-week tour. In a
              veiled way, Jane  expressed how she wanted to experience a &quot;wonderful,
              mystical, magical miracle&quot; (of true love) in Venice, to &quot;find
              what she's been missing all her life,&quot; rather than just visiting
              the normal tourist-sites (the art, the architecture and the canals).
              However, as she sat at a table by herself at an outdoor cafe in
              the crowded Piazza, she continued to feel out of place, lonely,
              and awkward when surrounded by loving couples.  The next day, Jane
              went shopping and a red glass goblet in the window of an antique
              shop caught her attention. She impulsively entered the chaotic,
              disorderly store where  she formally met the silver-haired, antiques-shop
              owner Renato de Rossi (Rossano Brazzi). Later, she
            suspected that Renato was producing fake red glass goblets and lying
            about their age - treating her like a naive tourist, but he sweet-talked
              her into believing him that he hadn't cheated her. She couldn't
              resist his romantic attentions, succumbed
          and agreed to have dinner with him on a formal date. Jane
          joined Renato to attend a moonlit orchestral concert (playing Rossini's
          Overture to &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot;)
          in the Piazza San Marco. During the concert, Jane selected a gardenia
          as her favorite flower (instead of a rose or carnation) from a
          flower vendor; later as they strolled along the canals, Jane accidentally
          dropped her gardenia into the water (and Renato was unable to reach
          out and retrieve it for her - a foreshadowing of the film's final
          scene). After being escorted back to her pensione, Renato kissed
          Jane, and she reciprocated by accepting more kisses after hurriedly
          responding: &quot;Oh,
          but --- I love you&quot; before running off and adding &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; The
          next day, she learned that Renato had lied to her earlier,
              and that  he was a married man! (although separated and in a loveless
          marriage). Renato arrived at the pensione and tried to explain why
          he had kept his marital status a secret: (&quot;It
          would end us before we began&quot;). He explained that Jane's expectations
          were all wrong: &quot;You're like a hungry child who was given ravioli
          to eat. No, you say, I want beefsteak. Young girl, you are hungry.
          Eat that ravioli&quot; - she responded that she wasn't desperate: &quot; I'm
          not that hungry.&quot;  Jane specified that her trip hadn't turned
          out the way she thought it would be: (&quot;I come from such a different
          world and I'm not going to be here long&quot;), but then kissed him.
          Although she refused his invitation for food and drink, and wished
          to be alone, she joined Renato for dinner and a night of dancing
          in various clubs - it was a classic sequence of seduction; he sang &quot;Summertime
          In Venice&quot; in Italian to her as they danced; afterwards, she was
          led back to his Venice canal home where from his balcony as they kissed,
          they watched a brilliant fireworks display (metaphoric for sexual passion
          - as in Hitchcock's <i>To Catch a Thief (1955)</i>) she dropped one
          of her new red shoes (a passionate color, and a symbolic transformation
          of the red goblets!) while following him into the apartment's bedroom
          for a mid-1950s romantic consummation (off-screen). Afterwards
              for a few days, they traveled by speed-boat to the island of Burano
              in the Venetian lagoon (&quot;the island where the rainbow fell&quot;);
          at sunset they reclined on a meadow by the water and spent more romantic
              days. Shortly later back in Venice at a
              cafe, Jane confessed: &quot;I
          don't want to forget any of it&quot;; and then next to a Venetian
          canal, Jane abruptly announced to Renato that she had decided to return
          home early and end their affair. She was packed and leaving in
          just a few hours. She admitted that she was very happy: (&quot;It's
          the happiest time I've had in my whole life&quot;), but she feared
          that their relationship would end unhappily if she overstayed her
          visit: (&quot;Because we have to. Because it's wrong, and because
          you and l would only end in nothing&quot;). She expressed how she
          didn't want him to see her off at the train station for her departure:
          (&quot;Let me go by myself&quot;), but secretly hoped that he would
          be there. She kissed him and raced off, and then waved to him from
          her departing gondola. At the Venice train station's
          platform  as the train pulled away, Renato ran
          alongside but was unable to reach her with a parting gift (a
          box holding another white gardenia) and she called out: &quot;Renato!&quot; in
          the film's ambiguous conclusion.</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Alfred Hitchcock<br />
              Alfred Hitchcock's lightweight, comedic and romantic suspense thriller
              and heist film (with a mystery element and racy dialogue) was set
              on the French Riviera, where a nighttime jewel-thief was creating
              panic amongst the visitors and residents. The opening view was
              of a distressed female after she noticed her empty jewelry case
              in her French Riveria hotel room. She was screaming: &quot;My jewels!
              I've been robbed. Someone stole my jewels&quot; -
              the film emphasized the motif of a stealthy, prowling jewel thief
              (cat burglar) that had committed the crime - a black cat crossed
          a slatted, tiled rooftop at night. The
          authorities' only suspect was a reformed and retired ex-burglar - American-born
          John Robie (Cary Grant), known as &quot;The Cat,&quot; who lived in
          a hillside villa near Cannes. Photographed
          from the air, the police (who arrived to question Robie)
          chased after him as he drove away and fled from his villa, although
          it was only a diversion. To successfully escape, Robie had boarded
          a bus to Cannes and was sitting in the rear seat, while he watched
          through the back window as detectives returned to his villa. Once Robie
          reached Cannes in the French Riviera, he decided to investigate the
          crime by himself and find the real thief who was imitating his crimes,
          before the police trailed and arrested him. He met with his old ex-con
          friends in a restaurant - head waiter Bertani (Charles Vanel) and wine
          steward Foussard (Jean Martinelli) from the days of French Resistance
          against the Germans during WWII. He was helped to evade police
          again via a speedy motor-boat by Foussard's smitten and flirtatious
          young, teenaged blonde daughter Danielle Foussard (Brigitte Auber)
          to a nearby, luxury Cannes hotel's beach club. While lounging on the
          hotel's beach, Robie (and the audience) had their first view of beautiful,
          lanky and cool blonde Frances Stevens (Grace Kelly) in a turban and
          sunglasses who was applying sun-tan lotion. Robie pursued his investigation
          of the recent string of 'cat' burglaries by meeting at a flower market
          in Nice with a contact of Bertani's named H. H. Hughson (John Williams)
                - an insurance agent of Lloyds of London. He was conveniently
                      provided with a detailed list of names of those on the
                Riviera who were heavily-insured clients with expensive jewels
                (supposedly, they would be the Cat's next victims). One of the
                names on the list was affluent, <i>nouveau riche</i> American
                widow - an oil millionairess named Mrs. Jessie Stevens (Jessie
                Royce Landis), who was traveling with her beautiful blonde daughter
                Frances and staying at the Carlton Hotel. Robie
                was able to maneuver drinks with Mrs. Stevens and her spoiled
                yet refined daughter, by posing as an Oregon lumber magnate named
                Conrad Burns (although Frances quickly saw through his disguise).
                 Afterwards to his complete surprise, Robie escorted Frances,
                a pretty and quiet socialite, back to her hotel suite, where
                she passionately kissed him at her door. The next morning, it
                was learned that the cat burglar had again struck and stolen
                more jewels.  Soon after, Frances attracted attention in the
                hotel's foyer with Robie - she was fashionably decked out in
                a high-necked, black bathing suit, oversized white sunhat, and
                white coverup. While Robie was reclining on a beach chair with
                Frances, cute brunette Danielle caught Robie's attention in her
                bathing suit, and they swam out to the hotel's floating raft.
                 Danielle informed Robie that Bertani's ex-convicts had been
                threatening to kill him (they were worried about discrediting
                suspicions being cast onto them). Frances swam out and joined
                them, where the two engaged in a verbal 'cat'-fight over the
                bemused Robie - both of the bitchy women were extremely jealous
                of each other. Later, Frances invited Robie to join her for a
                picnic basket lunch and a drive in her open convertible sports
                car (&quot;I have my car
                and a basket lunch with chicken and beer&quot;). After a tense
                and swervy car ride to evade a pursuit car of detectives, she
                flirted him as they parked and shared a picnic basket. She
                excitedly revealed that she knew he wasn't Mr. Burns, and suspected
                that he was the jewel thief John Robie. Later
                in Frances' hotel suite, Frances begged Robbie to make her his
                accomplice during the crime spree. While real fireworks exploded
                through the open doors in the background (over the water in the
                night sky), she enticed him by displaying
                her white strapless gown and his main weakness - her sparkling,
                glistening diamond necklace as the ultimate prize.  After
                their very seductive encounter, the next day, Frances accused
                Robie of being responsible for the loss (theft) of her mother's
                jewels (and her own sexual loss of virginity): &quot;Give
                    them back to me...Mother's jewels!&quot;  Robie confessed
                    to her  his true identity and revealed he was &quot;The
                    Cat&quot; (&quot;My
                    name is John Robie. I used to be a jewel thief several years
                    ago&quot;), but denied stealing her mother's jewels. He slipped
                out onto the roof when Frances attempted to summon the police.
                    Later in the film, when Robie was staking
                    out a house for the thief, he was attacked by an unknown
                    assailant; he inadvertently killed the man who was identified
                    as Danielle's father Foussard. Police mistakenly thought
                    he was The Cat, until Robie informed the police that it was
                    impossible for peg-legged Foussard (with a prosthetic leg)
                  to climb rooftops during robberies. Just
                  before a major costume ball scheduled for the weekend, Frances
                  apologized for accusing Robie of being the thief - she also
                  confessed that she loved him (&quot;I'M
                    IN LOVE WITH YOU&quot;) and would help find the real burglar.
                    They both attended the estate's fancy event, with Frances
                    wearing a Louis XV-era gold-gown. In 
                    the film's conclusion during the masked costume ball, Robie
                    (who was wearing a black Moorish nubian slave costume with
                    a mask and was able to switch places with Hughson) was free
                    to track the real Cat from the villa's rooftop during the
                    evening. He noticed a black-clad figure exiting a window
                    and traversing the rooftop - he froze, spied the figure,
                    and then chased after it. Robie caught
                    up to the masked thief - grabbed the individual - and unmasked
                    DANIELLE. A light was directed toward the rooftop and caught
                    Robie in the spotlight, but he proved his innocence and revealed
                    the real masked copycat thief - young blonde Danielle Foussard,
                    who fell and dangled from the roof's gutter until she confessed
                    that her father Foussard and restauranteur Bertani had planned
                    all of the robberies. In  the
                    final short scene set at Robie's Cote d'Azur villa, Frances
                    (still wearing her gold gown from the costume ball) urged
                    and pressured Robie into admitting that he was in love with
                    her. He obliged her by repeating what she had dictated to
                    him: &quot;Without
                    you, I couldn't have done it. I needed the help of a woman.
                    I guess I'm not the lone wolf I thought I was, Francie.&quot; As
                    they were about to say goodbye, he pulled her arm toward
                    him for an embrace and kiss. Frances had finally nabbed the
                    slightly-dismayed Robie - as she triumphantly noted in the
                    last line: &quot;So this is where you live. Oh, Mother will
                    love it up here!&quot;</font></p>        </td>

          <p><b><font size="2">Trial (1955)</font></b><font size="2">, 105
            minutes, D: Mark Robson <br />
           Director Mark Robson's and MGM's courtroom crime drama
          featured themes of bigotry, hypocrisy and  political extremism. It
           told about a controversial trial held after an Hispanic boy was arrested
           for the death of a Caucasian female, in a lynch-mob atmosphere of
           anti-ethnic race prejudice in the community, and during the growth
           of Communist special interests. In the film's pre-title credits sequence
           during a nighttime scene at a crowded San Juno Village, CA private
           beach (limited to residents only), after a loud scream, 17 year-old
           Hispanic teenager Angel Chavez (Rafael Campos) was found by a game
           warden standing over a deceased female, later identified as Marie
        Wiltse. It was the summer of 1947. At San Juno State University, five-year
           war veteran and idealistic, clean-cut university law instructor David
           Blake (Glenn Ford) was being threatened by Dean George
           (Everett Glass) with the non-renewal of his teaching contract, for
        lacking legal courtroom trial experience. Blake went searching for work
           in a law office - he visited the small law-firm of street-smart shark-attorney
           Barney Castle (Arthur Kennedy), assisted by his competent and smart
           legal secretary Abbe Nyle (Dorothy McGuire). He was offered a job
           if Castle could take on a case regarding a client that was currently
        in jail. The accused boy was being held in jail by racist courthouse
           jail-sheriff A. A. &quot;Fats&quot; Sanders
        (Robert Middleton) and visited by his mother Consuela (Katy Jurado).
           Chavez admitted that he had trespassed onto the private beach, and had become acquainted
	        with the victim who was a student in his HS. He claimed that she
	        willingly kissed him and they started to make out, but then she got
	        scared and ran away. He found her dead body up a flight of stairs
           and screamed for help. Abbe mentioned that the girl was known to have
           suffered from recurring rheumatic fever. The boy had to be
           charged on suspicion of statutory rape (due to Marie being under-age)
           and first-degree &quot;felony murder.&quot; Blake was hired by Castle as a defense lawyer
        to take the <i>pro-bono</i> Chavez case known as <i>State vs. Chavez. </i>The
        DA prosecutor was John &quot;Jack&quot; Armstrong (John Hodiak). A group of disgruntled townspeople,
	        led by aristocratic and bigoted real estate mogul Ralph Castillo
        (John Hoyt) and long-time Ku Klux Klan member Cap Grant (Paul Guilfoyle),
        sought vengeance by marching to the jail. Their 
        objective was to break the boy out of jail and execute him, but they
        were persuaded to leave by &quot;Fats&quot; who promised them a 'legal hanging.'
        During pre-trial preparations,  Blake began
	        to realize that the shady Castle had an ulterior motive. He clearly
	        had no desire for Angel to be acquitted, and was in fact sabotaging
	        the case. He was also manipulating and controlling the boy's
        mother Consuela Chavez. To raise funds for the defense, Castle organized
         a New York City fund-raising rally sponsored by the All Peoples Party
        (a Communist front). When the trial opened, it was  presided
	        over by black Judge Theodore Motley (Juano Hernandez); Blake suspected
	        the black judge had been chosen due to pressure from town bigots
        who wanted only the appearance of a fair trial.  The original jury panel
        was dismissed because of charges of jury tampering - the prospective
        jurors had been visited in their homes and interrogated (and intimidated)
        by city detectives beforehand. Blake was flown back to NYC to attend
        the rally, where he objected to Castle  taking
	        money from Communist groups and labor unions (&quot;Half of 'em are
        a bunch of Communists!...I don't want that kind of money&quot;). After
        tearing up a prepared speech, and about to give his own anti-Communist
        speech, Blake's microphone was cut and he was drowned out by a loud 
        brass band. Blake  realized that he had walked into a &quot;trap&quot; and
        was being used and duped by the prejudiced Castle for propagandistic
        purposes (a guilty verdict would bring continued racial unrest and promote
        fund-raising and support for his own Communist-backed organization).
        After three weeks, a jury was finally selected. During the trial's opening
        statements, the DA called for the death penalty. The DA's first witness
        was Marie's physician from childhood, Dr. Johannes Schacter (Richard
        Gaines), who testified that Marie died of &quot;violent exertion&quot; to
        her heart, due to a long history of rheumatic fever. Blake's strategy
        was based on solid, rigorous and aggressive cross-examination to rebut
        the prosecution's case. He revealed that the victim was at risk of dying
        at any time anyway, and she was found halfway up a long flight of stairs.
        The atmosphere of the trial was tense, due to the continuing protests
        of white supremacists and other lynch mob members who were rallying to
        put the Latino Chavez boy away. Even Castle was counting on Angel's testimony
        to be self-convicting, in order to ruin any chances of acquittal (and
        to make Chavez a martyr for his political leftist cause supporting a &quot;new
        world&quot; order). As it turned out, Angel's testimony was self-damning,
        vague and not very convincing. The jury ruled against Angel and he was
        convicted of the crime of felony murder. Blake sought to set
	      up an immediate appeal, but was fired by Castle to prevent him from
        participating in the sentencing hearing the next day. At the sentencing,
        Castle proposed a mandatory death penalty. Blake burst into the court
        and asked to speak during the sentencing with an &quot;amicus&quot; (friend
        of the court) ruling by the Judge. The race-baiting Castle strenuously
        objected and zealously denounced the Judge for
        &quot;outrageous prejudicial conduct,&quot; and derogatorily called
        him &quot;a handkerchief head&quot; and &quot;an Uncle Tom!&quot; Blake
	      delivered an emotional speech to denounce the bigoted and prejudiced
	        Castle for using everyone as his own pawns, and for supporting Angel's
	        execution in order to advance support for his own Communist interests
        even before the trial began. In the film's happy ending, Blake
	      argued for an obscure code statute requiring that the youthful juvenile
	        offender be sent for a short term to the state's industrial reform
	        school;. Even DA Armstrong added that the defendant should receive
	        an &quot;indeterminate sentence&quot; rather than the death penalty.
	        The Judge accepted Blake's argument for &quot;justice&quot; with a &quot;much
        fairer sentence.&quot; The film concluded with the Judge sentencing the
        out-of-order Castle to 30 days in the county jail for contempt of court
        due to his earlier outburst. </font></p></td>
