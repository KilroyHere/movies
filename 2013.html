        <p><font size="2"><b>All Is Lost (2013)</b>, 106 minutes, D: J.C. Chandor<br />
          In this unusually sparse adventure drama-thriller about survival (with
              the tagline: NEVER GIVE UP), there was only one cast member, and
              the entire film's dialogue was only 51 words. In the film's opening,
              the unnamed &quot;Our Man&quot; (Robert Redford's identity in the
              credits) read a letter addressed to his unnamed loved ones - &quot;All
              is lost here, except for soul and body...&quot; - apparently close
              to death himself - as he expressed regret and remorse for his life.
              Then, the film flashbacked to eight days earlier, when the sole
              veteran sailor found himself stranded and shipwrecked in the Indian
              Ocean, about 1700 nautical miles from the Sunda Straits. He was
              on a small 39 foot-long schooner, the <i>Virginia Jean</i>,
              that had accidentally collided with a floating, steel shipping
              container or crate that was aimlessly adrift. His vessel suffered
              severe structural damage in the hull, communications equipment
              failures, and salt water leaks and intrusions. And to top off everything,
              a massive tropical storm was about to hit. His boat capsized
              and rolled over twice, and eventually began to sink, and he was
              forced to abandon ship on an inflatable life raft. The experienced
              and resourceful sailor devised ingenious ways to navigate with
              a sextant into busy shipping lanes, to convert salt water to fresh
              drinking water, and to fish. On the eighth day, with growing despair,
              he placed his letter (from the film's opening) in a bottle and
              tossed it into the water. Later at night, he was startled by the
              approach of a light in the distance, but unfortunately set 
              his raft on fire after igniting his journal pages and charts to
              create a signal flare. The film ended with him sinking underwater
              as an outstretched hand from a boat reached out to grab him.</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b>American Hustle (2013)</b>, 138 minutes, D: David
          O. Russell<br />
          This entertaining, R-rated crime film with twisting themes of deceit
          and double-cross from director David O. Russell was also a black comedy,
          based in part on the FBI Abscam operation between the late 1970s and
          early 1980s. The film opened by introducing a persuasive, fast and
          smooth-talking hustler named Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) - he
          was slightly fat and balding, and owned a dry-cleaning enterprise.
          Rosenfeld was partnered with  alluring, cunning girlfriend Sydney
          Prosser (Amy Adams). Ambitious, but reckless, low-level  renegade
          FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) recruited (or ensnared) the
          crafty duo of Irving and Sydney to engage in a sting operation to implicate
          powerful and corrupt white-collar politicians-gangsters in New Jersey's
          underworld. In exchange, Sydney (incarcerated for fraud) would be released
          without charges. Sydney and Irving had been involved
          in various scam operations when she impersonated an English aristocrat
          (&quot;Lady Edith Greensly&quot;) with banking ties. One of their marks had been Richie - who busted
          them in a loan scam and was now demanding that the two help him to
          make some other arrests. They were tasked with hustling (passing a
          bribe) to Camden, New Jersey politician-mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy
          Renner), who was working to revitalize Atlantic City as a gambling
          destination, along with other Congressmen and Senators who were in
          on the fund-raising take. Another of Richie's targets was Mafia mobster
          boss Victor Tellegio (Robert DeNiro), the right hand man of Meyer Lansky
          (an organized crime figure). The payoff of $2,000,000 dollars failed,
          due to further surprise cons orchestrated by Irving and Sydney. One
          of the factors that explained Irving's complicated motivations was
          his desire to please his manipulative, brash, unpredictable and capricious
          wife - boozy, extroverted, and sociopathic Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence),
          the mother of his young adopted stepson Danny.</font></p>        </td>

		family living near Pawhuska, OK. In the film's opening, alcoholic Weston family
		patriarch Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard) disappeared and was found dead from a
		suicidal drowning five days later. He was the husband of strong-willed, racist,
		mean clan matriarch Violet (Meryl Streep), who was suffering from cancer and
		was heavily-medicated and addicted to her pain-killers. Members of the family
		gathered together for the funeral, among them Violet's three daughters: Violet's
		oldest, tough-minded daughter Barbara Weston-Fordham (Julia Roberts) from Colorado
		with her estranged (cheating) husband Bill Fordham (Ewan McGregor) and their
		rebellious, vegetarian 14 year-old teen daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin), Violet's
		unmarried and insecure middle daughter Ivy Weston (Julianne Nicholson), and Violet's
		impulsive, fun-loving, youngest daughter Karen
		Weston (Juliette Lewis) with her Ferrari-driving, previously-married and many-times
		divorced, wealthy Florida businessman fiancee Steve Huberbrecht (Dermot Mulroney).
		Additional arrivals included Violet's boisterous sister Mattie Fae Aiken (Margo
		Martindale) and her husband Charles Aiken (Chris Cooper), along with their shy
		adult son &quot;Little Charles&quot; Aiken, Jr. (Benedict Cumberbatch) (who was having
		a secret romance with Ivy). In the midst of everyone was Johnna Monevata (Misty
		Upham), a recently-hired Native-American (Cheyenne) young nurse and live-in cook/caregiver.
		In the midst of their interactions (often profane) with each other, the ensemble
		cast of characters revealed long-standing hostilities, bitter feelings, and repressed
		rage (including sexual assault: Steve against his 'niece' Jean). Secrets were
		revealed, such as childhood abuse (in the upbringing of Violet and Mattie), adultery
		(Bill's affair with a younger woman) and incest (in a secret confession, &quot;Little
		Charles&quot; was fathered between Mattie and Beverly, making &quot;Little Charles&quot; a half-brother
		to Ivy). </font></p>      </td>

          Linklater<br />
          The third and final film in a trilogy of dialogue-rich romantic dramas,
          including <i>Before Sunrise (1995)</i> and <i>Before Sunset (2004)</i>, featuring
        the same two stars: Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. This installment was
          set nine years after the previous film. The established married couple:
          French feminist C&eacute;line (Julie Delpy) and American author-novelist Jesse (Ethan Hawke), were
          on a summer vacation from Paris to Greece with their adolescent daughters,
          Ella (Jennifer Prior) and Nina (Charlotte Prior), but still faced major
          strains and adjustments in their long-term relationship, their careers,
          and their sometimes-conflicting gender roles. High school-aged Hank
          (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) - Jesse's 14-year-old son from his first
          marriage, who had been with them for the summer, had just returned
          to the US (he lived in Chicago with Jesse's bitter, alcoholic ex-wife).
          Celine was at a career crossroads, and had been offered a new lucrative
          job. During a single night together after friends had pre-paid for
          their hotel room (for their last night in Greece), the couple began
          to argue over whether Jesse was pressuring Celine to move with him
          to Chicago (and give up any career aspirations she had) so he could
          be a proper parent to his son Hank during his formative years. Although
          they momentarily shared heated words and then split from each other,
          Jesse caught up to Celine and charmed her by pretending he was a time-traveler
          with a letter she had written as an 82 year-old, describing their memorable
          one single night together: (Celine's reaction: &quot;Well, it must have
          been one hell of a night we're about to have&quot;). In the process of reconciling,
          they agreed that their romantic fantasies earlier in life couldn't
          all be fulfilled due to their life's choices, but that they nonetheless
          had a solid, real, committed and loving relationship: (Jesse: &quot;If you
          want true love, then this is it. This is real life. It's not perfect,
          but it's real&quot;). </font></p>        </td>

          179 minutes, D: Abdellatif Kechiche<br />
          Lesbian author Jul(ie) Maroh's 2010
          French novel <i>Blue Is the Warmest Color (Le Bleu Est Une Couleur
          Chaude)</i> was the inspiration for this explicit French
          romance film. This lengthy, erotic coming-of-age film described the
          life and love of two young lesbian women in France at the end of the
          1990s. The film opened by introducing 15 year-old French teenager Ad&egrave;le
          (Ad&egrave;le Exarchopoulos) who exhibited typical heterosexual behavior,
          but was experiencing confusing sexual identity issues. An encounter
          in a lesbian bar with intribuing, blue-haired, free-spirited, aspiring
          22 year-old female painter Emma (L&eacute;a
          Seydoux), a self-proclaimed 'dyke' who was about to graduate from Fine Arts school,
          would soon change her life, and they found that there was a mutual
          attraction. Their growing closeness and bond resulted in the two engaging
          in passionate sexual activity. Ad&egrave;le
          also became Emma's art subject and muse as the two spent more time
          together. There were class differences: Ad&egrave;le had conservative,
          working-class parents and took a job as a school-teacher, while Emma's
          family was freer and artsy, and her objective was showing off her art
          in various exhibitions. Although they lived together as a committed
          couple, eventually, the vast differences between the two manifested
          themselves, and Ad&egrave;le's infidelity led to an eventual break-up. As the two progressed into
          new phases of their lives, they kept in contact while still moving
          on and accepting their parting on friendly terms. </font></p></td>

        Writer/director Woody Allen's witty comedy-drama told about 
            an ex-rich Manhattan, NYC pampered socialite Jeanette &quot;Jasmine&quot; Francis
            (Cate Blanchett) who was forced to move to San Francisco to live
            in the apartment of her working-class, earthy sister Ginger (Sally
            Hawkins). The mentally-unstable Jasmine had come on hard times (heavily
            in debt) and had suffered a nervous breakdown, causing her to abuse
            both alcohol and drugs. In her past, her unfaithful husband Hal Francis
            (Alec Baldwin) was a successful financier, but then was arrested
            for fraud and jailed (and subsequently committed suicide). Two of
            those Hal had swindled were Ginger and her now-divorced, ex-husband
            Augie (Andrew Dice Clay). Now planted and seeking refuge in San Francisco,
            Jasmine wanted a fresh start. Meanwhile, she detested Ginger's on-and-off
            again new fiancee Chili (Bobby Cannavale). Jasmine's first job as
            a dental receptionist failed, so to bolster her financial situation,
            she sought to romance and catch the attention of wealthy widower
            Dwight Westlake (Peter Sarsgaard), a political diplomat who aspired
            to be a congressman. However, Jasmine's good fortune and imminent
            engagement to Dwight instantly dissolved when it was revealed that
            she had deceived him with lies about her past - she was the one who
            had informed the FBI that her cheating husband Hal was deep in fraud,
            leading to his arrest and demise. In the film's open-ended conclusion,
            Jasmine continued her lies - claiming to Ginger that she was about
            to be married to Dwight and was moving out. </font></p>      </td>

Wil Haygood's <i>Washington Post</i> article &quot;A Butler Well Served by This
Election,&quot; formed the basis for this ambitious and sweeping historical drama
and biopic (of real-life Eugene Allen). It followed the life story of White House
butler Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) who served eight US presidents over a period
of 34 years (from Eisenhower to Reagan). Cecil's story was told in a reflective
flashback from the year 2009 - beginning with his Southern childhood upbringing
in Georgia as a sharecropper's son, and his first White House staff position
during the second term of President Eisenhower. During his service, the film
chronicled the various concurrent civil rights movements, including multiple
instances of hate crimes and intimidation of blacks, school desegregation efforts,
segregated lunch counter sit-ins, the freedom rides, the 1963 Birmingham (AL)
Children's Crusade, the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights
Act of 1965, and more. Part of the film's narrative covered Cecil's stoic conflict
with his defiant eldest son Louis (David Oyelowo as adult), who at one time joined
the Black Panthers, while Cecil's
devoted wife Gloria Gaines (Oprah Winfrey) attempted to keep them at peace with
each other.</font></p>        </td>

          Greengrass<br />
          Director Paul Greengrass' intense and suspenseful biographical docudrama-thriller
          captured the real-life incident of the hijacking of an American cargo
          ship, the <i>MV Maersk Alabama</i>, by Somali pirates  off the Somali coast in April
        of 2009. The basis for the film's screenplay by Billy Ray was Richard
          Phillips' own 2010 book account: <i>A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates,
        Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea. </i>The
        film's title referred to Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) who commanded
        the unarmed freighter-container ship sailing along the dangerous East
        Coast of Africa to Mombasa, Kenya. Phillips realized an attack was imminent
        when he spotted two radar screen blips -  boats filled with Somali
        pirates along the Guardafui Channel. After a pursuit by speedboat skiffs,
         the cargo ship (on day two) was assaulted by four
          young trigger-happy Somali pirates, led by desperate Abduwali Muse
         (Barkhad Abdi), and Phillips was forced to surrender and was taken hostage.
        Their ransom demands included the exchange of the ship and its crew for
        millions of dollars of insurance money from the shipping company. The
        brave and courageous Captain Phillips found himself kidnapped on a lifeboat with
        the four pirates (including Muse), heading for Somalia. Meanwhile,
           the US Navy destroyer <i>USS Bainbridge</i>, with Commanding Officer
           Frank Castellano (Yul Vazquez) at the helm, intervened with an ultimately
           risky but successful rescue attempt. The bruised and beaten Phillips
           was saved, while three of the pirates were shot by marksmen, and Muse
           was taken prisoner and charged with the crime of piracy.</font></p>        </td>

        Director James Wan's R-rated supernatural &quot;haunted house&quot; horror film
        was the initial film in <i>The Conjuring</i> film franchise (2013-2021).
        It  contributed to another spin-off franchise known as the <i>Annabelle</i> films
        (2014-2019) about a possessed doll, and a third spin-off film known as <i>The
        Nun (2018)</i>. This original film, inspired by true-life events (similar to <i>The Amityville
        Horror</i> tale), dramatized the paranormal cases of married investigators/authors
        Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga). In the early
        1970s, the Warren demonologists were contacted for assistance by the
        besieged and terrorized Perron family, headed by Roger (Ron Livingston),
        his wife Carolyn (Lili Taylor), and their five daughters: Andrea (Shanley
        Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie
        Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver), who had recently moved into a secluded
        18th century farmhouse in rural Harrisville, Rhode Island. They complained
        of troubling sounds, smells, malevolent 'ghosts' or spirits, birds crashing
        into windows, strange paranormal incidents, the death of the family dog,
        and demonic forces in their house. An investigation turned up evidence
        of bewitched former house occupants or residents with reports of multiple
        murders and suicides. Problems intensified when Carolyn became fully
        possessed and cursed (by a murderous witch named Bathsheba Sherman (Joseph
        Bishara)), and she threatened to stab her own daughters Christine and
        April in the home's cellar. With time rapidly waning for the Catholic
        Church's (and Vatican's) approval (to conduct an exorcism), Ed went ahead
        with the exorcism, and with clairvoyant Lorraine's assistance, was able
        to end Bathsheba's curse in the nail-biting conclusion. </font></p>        </td>

          117 minutes, D: Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e<br />
        In this R-rated, grim true-story biographical medical drama, the highly
        relevant story surveyed the historical period of the mid-1980s when research
        had just begun to find successful treatments for HIV/AIDs, when the
        disease was highly stigmatized and mostly unknown. The story followed
        AIDS-suffering Dallas, TX patient Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey),
        a promiscuous rodeo cowboy and an electrician, who showed symptoms of
        AIDS and was diagnosed with the HIV virus affliction in 1986. The only
        available drug at the time was  zidovudine (AZT), an anti-retroviral
        drug  thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients, although the mostly-ineffective
        drug could exacerbate immune deficiency disorders. To treat his own condition,
        the AIDS activist sought out experimental, non-FDA approved, illegal
        pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, and resorted to importing (smuggling)
        them into Texas from Mexico, after seeing the unauthorized work of the
        Mexican clinic of Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne). With the friendship and help
        of a sick and effeminate drag queen - a trans-gender woman named Rayon
        (Jared Leto), the two helped fellow AIDS-patients by establishing a money-making
        scheme known as the &quot;Dallas Buyers Club.&quot; It sold $400/month memberships
        and entitled HIV-patient subscribers to the distribution of helpful (but
        illegal) AIDS drugs and other medications. Predictably, they ran into
        defiant opposition from the corporate pharmaceutical companies and the
        government's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), although they sought
        ways to outwit detection by federal agents. In the conclusion,
        Woodroof's life (death in 1992) was prolonged by seven years due to
        his heroically-motivated survival efforts. </font></p></td>

           along with two spin-off prequels: <i>Minions (2015)</i> and <i>Minions:
        The Rise of Gru (2021)</i>. In this second installment, former
        bald super-villain Gru (voice of Steve Carell) had retired and turned
        into an adoring super-dad and adoptive father with a family life, raising
         three cute daughters: eldest Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith
        (voice of Dana Gaier) and the youngest Agnes (voice of Elsie Fisher).
        He was making a legitimate and honest living producing jam with his elderly,
        unfulfilled, hearing-impaired gadget man Dr. Nefario (voice of Russell
        Brand) and the mischievous little yellow minions. He was notified by
        eccentric, Anti-Villain League (AVL) undercover agent Lucy Wilde (voice
        of Kristen Wiig) that a secret Arctic research laboratory had been stolen
        by a powerful aircraft using a giant magnet. Gru was summoned to speak
        to the AVL Director Silas Ramsbottom (voice of Steve Coogan), and was
        recruited to reclaim a highly-potent, experimental trans-mutation serum
        (mutagen PX-41) that had been taken from the lab. (The mutagen was capable
        of creating indestructible and ravenous monsters out of harmless living
        organisms.) While falling in love with Lucy during the case, a romantic
        sub-plot, Gru came to suspect that the main super-villain (long presumed
        dead) was Eduardo P&eacute;rez, nicknamed
         &quot;El Macho&quot; (voice of Benjamin Bratt), the small business-owner of Salsa &amp; Salsa
         - a Mexican cantina restaurant located in The Paradise Shopping Mall.
         He also learned that his own friend Dr. Nefario had been recruited to
         work for El Macho, and had already abducted and mutated a large number
         of Gru's minions using the stolen serum - turning them into insane,
         savage purple-furred monsters. Meanwhile, Eduardo's rebellious, leather-jacketed
         tween son Antonio P&eacute;rez (voice of Mois&eacute;s Arias) was romancing
         Gru's daughter Margo. Gru was forced to balance his devoted caring for
         his daughters (including a search to provide a mother for them) with
         his new saving-task of defeating the enigmatic super-villain, who had
         nefarious plans to dominate the world. </font></p>      </td>

              challenges of finding love. At a party in the Pacific Palisades
              (a suburb of Los Angeles, CA), divorced masseuse Eva (Julia
              Louis-Dreyfus), the single middle-aged mother of a college-bound
              teenaged daughter Ellen (Tracey Fairaway), was introduced to Albert
              (James Gandolfini) by her married friends - Will (Ben Falcone)
              and Sarah (Toni Collette). She also met a successful poet named
              Marianne (Catherine Keener), who soon became a new massage client
              and friend of Eva's. After dating the portly, good-natured Albert,
              Eva realized that he was the ex-husband of Marianne. As her romantic
              relationship progressed with Albert, Eva learned all about him
              from embittered and pessimistic ex-wife Marianne when she complained
              about all of his bad habits, quirks, and slobbiness - putting a
              damper on her feelings. However, one of the bonds they shared was
              that Albert was also about to become an empty-nester - he was 
              the single father of college-bound daughter Tess (Eve Hewson).
              Eva deceptively kept from Albert the fact that she knew Marianne,
              and vice-versa. When it was finally exposed that Eva was friends
              with Marianne, Albert angrily broke up with her. The film concluded
              with some promising signs that they would be reunited once the

          Justin Lin<br />
          The 6th installment of the long-running <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> franchise-series
          (beginning in 2001),  about illegal street-racing, car chases,
          espionage and orchestrated heists, was a sequel to <i>Fast Five (2011)</i>.
          As the action-thriller  opened, members of a professional criminal
          gang led by main thief Dominic &quot;Dom&quot; Toretto (Vin Diesel) appeared
          to have settled down or semi-retired. For example, ex-FBI agent Brian
          O'Conner (Paul Walker) was living with Dom's sister Mia Toretto (Jordana
          Brewster), taking care of a new son named Jack. However, Dom (and his
          fugitive renegade crew members) were summoned back into dangerous action
          situations by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) Agent Luke Hobbs
          (Dwayne Johnson), in exchange for amnesty (full pardons) for their
          past crimes. They were instructed to travel to London to confront an
          elusive, skilled team of mercenary drivers in an organization led by
          malevolent, rogue mastermind Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Complications
          arose when Dom realized that one of Shaw's main figures was Dom's ex-lover
          Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) - who was apparently murdered two
          films earlier, and was now suffering from amnesia. Dom's mission was
          to shut down Shaw's international terrorist acquisition and marketing
          of components for a deadly device capable of causing mass devastation. </font></p>        </td>

          Coogler<br />
          Writer/director Ryan Coogler's urban drama (his feature film debut)
          centered on the true story of a man who was involved in a deadly incident
          at 'Fruitvale Station' on New Years' Day in the year 2009. 22 year-old
          African-American Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan) was killed by BART
          police officer Johannes Mehserle (depicted as Officer Ingram, portrayed
          by Chad Michael Murray) on the platform of the Fruitvale district station
          of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in Oakland, CA. Later in
          the year, Officer Mehserle was charged with second-degree murder (for
          shooting the unarmed and subdued Grant in the back), but was only found
          guilty of involuntary manslaughter. The documentary-styled biographical
          film followed the life of Grant for the 24 hours before his lethal
          shooting. He was living with his Latina girlfriend Sophina (Melonie
          Diaz) and their beautiful, 4 year-old kindergarten-aged daughter Tatiana
          (Ariana Neal). During his final day, Grant (an ex-con for drug dealing)
          crossed paths with  friends, his family (especially his strong-willed,
          tough-love mother Wanda (Octavia Spencer)), and other strangers. Grant
          was mired in various problems and complex issues as the film opened:
          his recent firing from his supermarket job, his infidelities to Sophina,
          his quick-temper, and his indebtedness. His fateful decision to travel
          to and from San Francisco on public transit on New Years' Eve, leading
          to the actual shooting incident, was portrayed by both the actual footage
          and a fictional re-creation.</font></p>        </td>

        Best Director-winning Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's stunning sci-fi thriller
        with exceptional special-effects was an exciting tale about two American
        astronauts on a space shuttle mission who became stranded in space. On
        her first trip into space, engineer/scientist Dr. Ryan Stone (Best Actress-winning
        Sandra Bullock) was accompanied by lead veteran astronaut Lieut. Matt
        Kowalsky (George Clooney) on board the Space Shuttle
        <i>Explorer</i>, on an Earth-orbiting mission. The two were engaged in
        a space-walk to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). As
        a result of the Russians shooting down one of their own presumed-dead
        satellites, catastrophic space debris was headed in their direction,
        and it struck both their shuttle (killing other crew members) and the
        telescope, causing extensive damage. While considering a number of possible
        options in an attempt to survive and return to Earth, Kowalsky was forced
        to sacrifice himself in order to provide Stone with an opportunity to
        make it alone as the sole survivor. At the International Space
        Station (ISS) and within one of its two <i>Soyuz</i> spacecraft, Stone
        was forced to contemplate her own life, incidents and adversities in
        her tragic past, and her own mortality - she seriously considered committing
        suicide, but an hallucinatory appearance of Kowalsky encouraged her to
        persevere and emboldened her will-power and spirit to continue her quest
        to survive. In the film's tense conclusion, she was able to enter the
        Shenzhou capsule of Tiangong's space station and descend into Earth's
        atmosphere. Stone almost drowned when dropped into a lake as  she
        struggled to exit the capsule's hatch, but emerged resilient and
        triumphant. </font></p>        </td>

          Writer/director Spike Jonze's off-beat romantic drama was the story
              of an unusual relationship that developed between a man and a computer's
              female voice, becoming a treatise on all modern human relationships.
              Set in Los Angeles, CA in the near or immediate future, divorcing,
              lonely, withdrawn, defeated and introverted Theodore Twombly (Joaquin
              Phoenix) had purchased a new computer OS (Operating System) with
               highly-advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) - a female virtual
              assistant named Samantha (voice of Scarlett Johansson). Meanwhile,
              his full-time job was working for a website (.com) business as
              a writer - composing and dictating personal handwritten letters
              for others who were too busy to do it themselves. He was in the
              midst of an impending divorce and signing papers to break
              off his marriage to his childhood sweetheart Catherine Klausen
              (Rooney Mara), while he would often communicate with his married
              and troubled neighbor Amy (Amy Adams), who was in a difficult marriage
              to her unsupportive husband Charles (Matt Letscher). However, Theodore
               found more empathy with Samantha, who was intelligently-programmed
              to adapt and evolve with him, as they discussed intimate details
              about his life and loves. Remarkably, while he was falling in love
              with Samantha, he was able to have a verbal, telepathic or virtual
              sexual experience with her, exhibiting how closed off Theodore
              had become from real human emotions with flesh-and-blood companions.
              However, his relationship with Samantha then soured and broke off
              when she revealed that she was evolving away from him, was talking
              (and falling in love) with hundreds of others, and was leaving
              for a new plane of existence. The film's ended optimistically with
              Theodore finding further comfort in Amy's conversational company
              on the rooftop of their complex.</font> </p>        </td>

          Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
          from the threatening Middle-Earth dragon Smaug (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch).
          Thorin - the true heir to Erebor's throne, was prepared to reclaim
          the abandoned kingdom of Erebor from Smaug and retake the dwarves'
          lost gold treasure inside the mountain. The film also featured the
          vengeful pursuit of Thorin by an Orc named Bolg (Lawrence Makoare),
          the son of Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett), while wizard Gandalf the
          Grey (Ian McKellen) investigated the growing evil in the ruins of Dol
          Guldur - the stronghold of a sorcerer known as the Necromancer. There,
          Gandalf was ambushed by Azog   and
          defeated by the Necromancer, who revealed himself to be Sauron in disguise.
          Once Thorin's company reached the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo accidentally
          awakened Smaug, who was aware of their mission to reclaim the gold.
          Meanwhile, Azog and his Orc army were marching from Dol Guldur towards
          the Lonely Mountain. The film concluded with the raging Smaug flying
          off to destroy nearby Laketown filled with humans, bolstered by heroic
          everyman Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans).</font></p>      </td>

          minutes, D: Francis Lawrence<br />
          This was the second installment of the popular <i>Hunger Games</i> franchise,
          a sci-fi adventure film series set in a dystopian future.  It was the
          sequel to <i>The Hunger Games (2012)</i>, and was followed by the two-part
          <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014) and Part 2 (2015)</i>.
          A trilogy of novels written by  Suzanne Collins from 2008-2010 formed
        the basis for the films. In the continuing saga set a few months after
          the previous episode, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) returned
          to her home in District 12 after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games,
          when she and male tribute Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) were declared
          joint official winners. The head of the government
          President Snow (Donald Sutherland) interpreted their cooperative actions
          in the games (to commit suicide together) to be an act of rebellion
          against the Capitol. Both Peeta and Katniss were suffering from the
          physical and emotional stress of their ordeal. In reality, Katniss'
          love for Peeta was staged rather than authentic and sincere, and he
          was disappointed in her faked affection. She was urged by a threatening
          President Snow during her upcoming Victory Tour of the Districts to
          convince the masses that her victory was due to her overwhelming love
          for male tribute Peeta rather than as an act of defiance against the
          oppressive and brutal Capitol regime. The plotting and diabolical Snow
          announced that the participants (tributes) in the next 75th Annual
          Hunger Games (a third special contest only held every 25 years and
          known as the Quarter Quell) would be composed of 24 Tributes selected
          from among the living victors - meaning that it would include both
          Katniss and Peeta. It was obvious that Snow was threatened by Katniss'
          popularity among the people and the threat of growing rebellion and
          revolution. During the games, some of the tributes worked cooperatively
          together to save Katniss and Peeta in the arena, to enable them to
          continue their leading adversarial role against the Capitol. It was
          also revealed that head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour
          Hoffman) was on the rebel's side against Snow. In retaliation for destroying
          the arena and escaping in a rebel hovercraft, Katniss' District 12
          homeland was firebombed by
          President Snow, forcing her to find refuge in District 13 - a new underground
          rebel headquarters.</font></p>        </td>

      In this historical melodrama set in the year 1921, a few years after the
          Great War (WWI) ended, two innocent Polish-Catholic emigrant sisters:
          Ewa Cybulski (Marion Cotillard) and Magda (Angela Sarafyan), arrived
           at Ellis Island, in New York City, NY. They were to meet up with
          their expatriate relatives, Uncle Wojtek (Ilia Volok) and Aunt Edyta
          Bistricky (Maja Wampuszyc), who didn't show - it was only the beginning
          of their troubles to survive in the new land. Authorities held back
          Magda from release due to her unexpected diagnosis tuberculosis (lung
          disease) and she was forced into quarantine, while Ewa was saved from
          deportation (due to branding rumors of her loose morals on board the
          ship) by a charismatic stranger - an immigrant-&quot;fixer&quot;/pimp named Bruno
          Weiss (Joaquin Phoenix) who bribed the authorities. Ewa became one
          of Bruno's Bandits' Roost theater &quot;actresses&quot; in a brothel's burlesque
          show, to help pay for her sister's medical care and release. Soon enough,
          Ewa was living in a flophouse and also prostituting herself. When Ewa
          was threatened with deportation a second time, she was again bailed
          out by Bruno. A love triangle began to develop when debonair illusionist-magician
          &quot;Orlando&quot;, Bruno's cousin named Emil  (Jeremy
          Renner), became smitten with Ewa, and it ultimately led to jealousy
          and conflict that ended with Bruno's stabbing of Emil in an apparent
          act of self-defense. Bruno eventually was able to aid Ewa by paying
          his Ellis Island contacts with money she had acquired from her aunt.
          As a result, Ewa's sister was released and the two departed for New
          Jersey, while Bruno remained in New York intending to confess to his
          crime.</font></p>      </td>

          &amp; Joel Coen<br />
        The film-making duo Coen Brothers created this bleak fictional musical
        drama set in the year 1961 that followed one week in the depressing and
        miserable life of Greenwich Village folk singer Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac).
        Part of the downbeat tale was based upon the autobiography of American
        folk singer Dave Van Ronk who was nicknamed the &quot;Mayor of MacDougal
        Street&quot; in NY's Village and was a fixture among the coffeehouse folk
        culture. In the meandering black comedy-drama set in the dead of a dark
        and gray winter, idealistic singer/songwriter Davis was struggling with
        growing debt and with recognition as an artist,
        especially after the suicidal death of his performing partner Mike Timlin.
        No one was interested in offering him a paying musical gig as a soloist.
        Homeless and relying on support from friends, associates and fellow folk-singers,
        he also was dismayed when he learned he had possibly impregnated female
        acquaintance Jean Berkey (Carey Mulligan) (who was dating his best friend
        and fellow folk-singer Jim Berkey (Justin Timberlake)) and then was asked
        to pay for her abortion. In a desperate move, he took a road trip to
        the midwest with two others: heroin-junkie and voodoo-practicing jazz
        musician Roland Turner (John Goodman) and his sidekick valet - a beat
        poet named Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund). Once he arrived in Chicago,
        he auditioned for music impresario Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) who
        was unimpressed with his solo performance. Returning back to NYC by hitchhiking,
        the unlikeable Davis came to realize he was unable to be successful in
        reaching his musical ambition because of his continual debt-issues, personal
        disconnectedness, outright mistakes, and lack of true and original artistic
        talent. </font></p>        </td>

          This second sequel of the <i>Iron Man</i> trilogy, composed of  <i>Iron
          Man (2008)</i> and <i>Iron Man 2 (2010)</i>, was also the 7th film
          in the
          <a href="superheroes-marvel.html"><i>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</i></a>.
          It was the highest-grossing (domestic) film of 2013. In this big-budget,
          action-oriented sci-fi superhero film, industrialist Tony Stark/Iron
          Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) had been affected by the events that climaxed <i>Marvel's
          The Avengers (2012)</i>,
          including Loki's attack on New York City in 2012. Suffering from PTSD,
          nightmares and insomnia and living in Malibu, CA, the now vulnerable,
          restless and anxious Stark was spending many hours developing new Iron
          Man suit prototypes. He had delegated his responsibilities for Stark
          Enterprises to his partner/girlfriend Virginia &quot;Pepper&quot; Potts
          (Gwyneth Paltrow), and turned over his duties as Iron Man to his brave
          best friend Col. James &quot;Rhody&quot; Rhodes (Don Cheadle), aka
          Iron Patriot. But then he was called upon to confront a new mysterious
          terrorist megalomaniac known as the Mandarin, who seized America's
          TV airwaves, and attacked Grauman's (TCL) Chinese Theatre in Hollywood
          with mutated soldiers. Stark escaped a helicopter gun-ship invasion
          at his home and was flown in one of his new experimental, prototype
          MK42 Iron Man suits in a pre-determined path to Rose Hill, TN, the
          site of an earlier Mandarin attack. At the same time, a villainous
          disabled scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who had been spurned
          by Stark in 1999, kidnapped Pepper and destroyed Stark's Malibu mansion.
          In TN, Stark teamed up with 10 year-old boy Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins),
          and discovered that Killian had cured his own disability with an Extremis
          virus, and that the two recent invasions (in TN and in CA) were the
          work of Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM), Killian's scientific R&amp;D
          company. The highly-experimental Extremis biological virus program
          was able to cure the crippling injuries of injured war veterans, but
          if improperly metabolized, the user's body would sometimes reject the
          treatment, heat up and explode. Killian was covering up the failures
          of his flawed program by designating the explosions as a terrorist
          plot. In Miami, FL, Stark discovered that Killian was the real 'Mandarin'
          - hiding behind the cover of a British actor named Trevor Slattery
          (Ben Kingsley). Killian also revealed that he had subjected Potts to
          Extremis in order to force Stark's hand and gain his assistance in
          fixing Extremis' flaws. Threats were also made against US President
          Ellis (William Sadler) onboard Air Force One. In a multi-pronged effort
          in the exciting conclusion, Stark was able to save both Potts and Ellis,
          and kill Killian (with Potts' assistance).</font></p>        </td>

          143 minutes, D: Zack Snyder<br />
          Based on the DC comic-book superhero character Superman, this film
          was the first installment in the <a href="superheroes-dcextended.html"><i>DC
          Extended Universe (DCEU)</i></a>. It was a reboot of the original <a href="series-superman.html"><i>Superman
        series-franchise</i></a> starring Christopher Reeve. It was essentially
        a retelling of the character's origin story. The planet of Krypton was
        destabilizing as Jor-El (Russell Crowe), the scientist father of the
        future title character named Kal-El, sacrificed himself to save his young
        newborn son. In the midst of a failed coup attempt by General Zod (Michael
        Shannon) (who was later banished to the Phantom Zone), the planet's head
        scientist Jor-El and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) launched their progeny  in
        a spacecraft away from the doomed planet. The capsule landed in farmland
        in Smallville, KS, where the alien boy was adopted by childless couple
         Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) - with a new
        name, Clark Kent (Henry Cavill as adult). When he grew older, Clark wisely
        hid his special powers, and became inspired by a holographic message
        from his late father (found in a Canadian Arctic scouting ship) to become
        Earth's greatest protector. He rescued  investigative <i>Daily Planet</i> journalist
        Lois Lane (Amy Adams) at the site, who promised not to file her report
        and reveal his hidden identity. At the same time, a signal beacon from
        the spacecraft in the ice alerted banished General Zod to Superman's
        location, and Zod and his forces arrived and threatened Earth with terraforming
        - to transform  the planet  into a new Krypton. Clark Kent/Superman refused
        to surrender to Zod, donned his Superman suit, and confronted the alien
        Kryptonite in a monumental battle in Metropolis, to avoid the destruction
        of humanity. As the film concluded, Clark adopted
        a civilian alias   as a freelance reporter for the <i>Daily Planet</i>.

          This computer-animated fraternity comedy was a prequel to <i>Monsters,
          Inc. (2001)</i> (Pixar's first prequel), telling the backstory of 
        short, rotund, single-eyed and green Mike Wazowski (voice of Billy Crystal)
          and lazy large blue monster James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan
        (voice of John Goodman)  who became
        friends while attending college. In the film's opening set in Monstropolis,
        young six year-old Mike attended an elementary school field trip to Monsters,
        Incorporated - a scare company-factory, where he aspired to be a Scarer
        and attend Monsters University after graduating. Years later, he arrived
        at MU, where he and his nerdy roommate Randall &quot;Randy&quot; Boggs (Steve Buscemi)
        found themselves competing with a really imposing and 'natural' monster
        known as Sulley. Sulley joined the elite fraternity Roar
        Omega Roar (R&Omega;R), while Mike and Randall were rejected. The two
        rivals Mike and Sulley were  ejected from the Scare Program 
        after engaging in a squabble  during semester's final exams
        by strict Dean Abigail Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), destroying one of
        her beloved objects. To regain a chance to re-enroll in the university,
        the two were given a chance to rejoin, if they could attain their fraternity's
        victory as the most frightening in the annual Greek Scare Games. Sulley
        reluctantly joined with Mike in a misfit fraternity known as Oozma
        Kappa (OK), along with four other loser/oddball friends, including  mama's
        boy Scott &quot;Squishy&quot; Squibbles (voice
        of Peter Sohn), two-headed Terry (voice of Dave Foley) and Terri (voice
        of Sean Hayes), mustachioed middle-aged  
        Don Carlton (voice of Joel Murray), and U-limbed Art (voice of Charlie
        Day). The final round of the Games pitted OK vs. R&Omega;R, but in the
        end both Sulley and Mike were expelled for breaking the rules, and had
        to work at joining the Scare team at Monsters, Inc. the hard way - by
        taking jobs as lowly mail room employees. </font></p>        </td>

          Director Alexander Payne's B/W, bittersweet road-trip drama told of
              a reconnected bond that developed between an aging father in Montana
              and his son on their way to Nebraska to claim a million-dollar
              magazine sweepstakes jackpot that the dad was notified about in
              a mailed letter. The film opened in Billings, MT, where tempestuous,
              elderly Woodrow T. &quot;Woody&quot; Grant (Bruce
              Dern) was known to disappear and wander along the shoulders of
              roadways toward his destination. His outspoken wife Kate Grant
              (June Squibb) was increasingly annoyed, worried and angry with
              Woody for his befuddling behavior. Woody claimed to her and to
              his youngest son, stereo salesman David Grant (Will Forte), that
              he was heading to Lincoln, NB to redeem his sweepstakes ticket
              prize (obviously a mail scam). After repeated wanderings of his
              father, David reluctantly agreed to drive his father to his obsessed
              destination, to receive his prize (in person) at the company's
              head marketing office in Nebraska. The adventure film documented
              their (mis)adventures, including dealing with the results of Woody's
              alcoholism, and a visit with Woody's hometown family in Hawthorne,
              NB including a full family reunion. In Hawthorne, Woody's boisterous
              claims of a 'windfall' to old family friend/barfly Ed Pegram (Stacy
              Keach) became well-known throughout the community, and caused commotion
              among those scrambling for their claim. The road-trip turned out
              to be an experiential eye-opener and revelation for David as he
              gained a whole new perspective on his father.</font></p>        </td>

          Frears<br />
          Journalist Martin Sixsmith's 2009 novel   <i>The Lost Child of Philomena
          Lee</i> was the basis for director Stephen Frears' moving and poignant
          drama about the title character's 50 year search for her forcibly-adopted
        son and Sixsmith's efforts to help search for his whereabouts. The film's
          opening told about the loss of Labour Party  employment (press
          secretary for a government minister) by London-based BBC free-lance
          political journalist Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) in the year 2002.
          He was persuaded by Jane (Anna Maxwell Martin), the young Irish daughter
          of Philomena Lee (Dame Judi Dench), to write a 'human interest' story
          about her mother's search for her son. The young toddler named Anthony
          was taken away from her decades ago when she became pregnant as a teenager
          and was forced to live in a Catholic convent. As a God-fearing, devout
          Catholic teenager, Philomena (Sophie Kennedy Clark as teen) lived at
          Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea, Ireland as an unwed mother with others
          facing her same predicament. They had been required to live and work
          there (Philomena toiled in the laundry) for four years and serve the
          Abbey as &quot;repayment.&quot;
          Against her will, Philomena's son Anthony (Tadhg Bowen) was adopted
          out (or sold to wealthy parents) when he was three years old. Now 50
          years later, she wondered what had become of him. Anecdotal, uncertain
          leads took their search first to the convent in Ireland, and then to
          her hometown of Washington, DC, as both Philomena and Martin wondered
          what would be the outcome of their discoveries. Ultimately, the boy
          - named Michael A. Hess - was revealed to be a Republican senior official
          in the US government who had died 8 years earlier, allegedly from AIDS
          due to his homosexuality. He was physically-abused by his adoptive
          parents, and had conducted his own search for his mother during his
          dying days, including a visit to the convent where he was adopted out.
          One of his dying wishes was to be buried in the convent's cemetery.
          In the film's final shocking revelation, set at the convent, Martin
          coerced unrepentent elderly nun Sister Hildegarde McNulty (Barbara
          Jefford) to confess that she had lied to Michael about his mother during
          his visit, to deny him the opportunity to ever meet Philomena, in order
          to punish her for having sex out of wedlock. </font></p>        </td>

          Director Harmony Korine's R-rated, edgy and subversive teen drama explored
          the hedonistic spring break experiences of four college-aged teens
          in Florida. Some considered it controversial for its depiction of females,
          but others judged it as a feminist-empowerment treatise. Desperate
          to attend spring break in Florida like their fellow classmates, college
          party girls Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Cotty (Rachel
          Korine, the director's wife), committed an act of robbery at a restaurant
          to raise the money. The uncaring, rebellious, and promiscuous co-eds
          were joined by their more conservative, religiously-oriented best friend
          Faith (Selena Gomez), on a trek to St. Petersburg, FL with thousands
          of other spring-breakers. After attending a wild beachfront apartment
          party drenched in alcohol, sex, and drugs, they were arrested and booked
          for narcotics possession. Local rapper, drug hustler and arms dealer
          Alien (James Franco) bailed them out, for some unknown reason. Fearing
          danger and further uncomfortable situations with &quot;bad boy&quot; Alien, Faith
          boarded a bus found northward to return to school. The remaining three
          friends followed Alien to a strip club where he was confronted by its
          owner - his bitter rival drug dealer Archie &quot;Big
          Arch&quot; (Gucci Mane). Under Alien's bad influence and lure of his
          &quot;American dream,&quot;  he convinced the girls to commit several armed robberies.
          During one incident, Cotty was injured in a drive-by shooting by Big
          Arch's gang - prompting her to return home. Following three-way sex
          with Alien by the pool, the reckless Candy and Brit were persuaded
          to take revenge on Big Arch - culminating in an assault on the dealer's
          mansion, the death of Alien, and the girls' lethal shooting of Big

          sci-fi film as a remake of <a href="series-startrek2.html"><i>Star
          Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)</i></a>, it was mostly an homage
          film with some similarities. The film's chronological setting was in
          the year 2259, a year after the events of the previous film. Captain
          James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), commander of the starship <i>USS
             Enterprise</i> in
            the mid-23rd century, was on a mission with his crew, including First
             Officer Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto). Other major crew members
             included Dr. Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy (Karl Urban), Lt. Nyota
             Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Lt. Hikaru Sulu (John Cho), Lieutenant
             Comm. Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott           (Simon Pegg),
             navigator Ensign Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and science officer
             Dr. Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) (using a false identity). Their objective
             was to engage in a manhunt to capture terrorist mastermind Commander
              John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) (aka Khan Noonien Singh).
              Khan's false identity was as Harrison, a Starfleet renegade commander/agent.
              He was in fact  a
        genetically-augmented super-human warlord who was resurrected from 300
              years of cryosleep after waging war on Earth. Harrison revealed
              that the 72 torpedoes on board the <i>Enterprise</i> (destined
              to be used against Harrison) each contained a genetically engineered
              human in cryosleep -- the remaining members of Khan's crew from
              the <i>SS Botany Bay</i>.  Harrison was fleeing
              to his Klingon homeworld of Kronos. Of course, Kirk's mission into
              Klingon territory to capture Khan threatened to instigate a war
              between the Federation and the Klingons, although Kirk's idea was
              to take Harrison prisoner and have him face justice back on Earth.
              After various military maneuverings, Khan took control of a large
              Starfleet warship, the
              <i>USS Vengeance</i>, commanded by Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller),
              Carol's father, and crashed it into San Francisco in an attempt
              to destroy Starfleet Headquarters. Kirk - who had been radiation-poisoned
              and sacrificed himself during the conflict - was revived using
              Khan's blood. Khan was sealed in his cryogenic pod and stored with
              his compatriots as the film concluded.

          (Chris Hemsworth) with Loki (Tom Hiddleston), his adoptive brother
          and nemesis, to save the Nine Realms from the Dark Elves. The film
          opened on the eve of the Convergence (a rare time of alignment of the

          vengeful leader of a primordial race, a Dark Elf named Malekith (Christopher
          Eccleston) who sought to destroy the Nine Realms by unleashing the
          Aether. Thor was reluctantly forced to call upon Loki to help defeat

          Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) living in the free state of NY (Sarasota
          Springs). In 1841, he was kidnapped and sold into bondage (recounted
          in Northup's own 1853 memoir) during a short trip to Washington, DC
          when he was tricked by two nefarious white men. Although he protested
          and claimed he had free status, Northup was put up for auction by New

          carpenter Tibeats (Paul Dano) that almost took Northup's life, he was

      <p><font size="2"><b>Under the Skin (2013),</b> 108 minutes, D: Jonathan Glazer<br />
        Director Jonathan Glazer's slick, surreal, futuristic, sci-fi horror-thriller
            was based upon Michel Faber's 2000 novel of the same
            name.  In the plot's elusive opening, a
            female's inert body (Lynsey Taylor Mackay) was found by the side
            of the road in a riverbed by a black leather-clad motorcyclist, known
            as the &quot;Bad
            Man&quot;
            (Jeremy McWilliams). He threw the comatose body into the back of
            a white van. In the next scene set in a sterile-white room, an other-worldly,
            nameless, naked &quot;Female&quot; (Scarlett Johansson) donned the
            clothes of the woman found by the roadside - seeming to assume her
            identity. In a series of scenes that followed, the predatory female
            (alien) drove a cargo van and temptingly lured lonely and unsuspecting
            men (or victims) to join her in the vehicle. After being driven to
            a dilapidated house and hypnotically seduced, the men that she specifically
            selected would be stripped (supposedly to prepare for sex) but then
            were taken to another dimension, void, or black liquid abyss and
            consumed as if they were human prey. Over time in a process of self-discovery,
            the female began to experience an identity crisis of sorts, and was
            beginning to more fully understand complex human life from an alien
            perspective, rather than just desiring to hunt them as prey. And
            it appeared that her renegade actions were   disapproved
            by the motorcyclist, who was angrily searching for her. In one
            of the alien's final encounters, she ripped off her clothes (including
            her human flesh-skin), revealing black skin on a featureless body
            underneath. She was set on fire by a forest worker-&quot;Logger&quot; (Dave
            Acton), and the film concluded with her body burning down to nothing
            more than a pile of ash - with smoking drifting upward into the sky. </font></p>      </td>

          D: Martin Scorsese<br />
          Crooked and slick banker Jordan Belfort's own 2007 memoirs were the
          source of the screenplay for Scorsese's 
          obscenity-laced, R-rated crime drama, about his time as a hard-selling
          NY stockbroker. In a cultural time of rampant sex and permissive drug
          use, Belfort founded his own firm, later renamed Stratton Oakmont in
          1989, with the sole objective of making money with 'hard sell' tactics
          and artificially-inflated prices, although he was only engaged in the
          high-pressure sale of semi-worthless penny stocks. His team of salesmen
          included his neighbor: second-in-command Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill),
          who promoted the stocks for a 50% commission. Belfort's ascendancy
          in the financial world took off after an article in
          <i>Forbes Magazine</i> dubbed him  &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street.&quot; His
           personal life was one of debauchery, Quaaludes and cocaine drug use,
          alcohol and other hedonistic excesses. After cheating on his wife Teresa
          Petrillo (Cristin Milioti), he dropped her for a beautiful model
          named Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie), and then cheated on her with
          other hookers while she bore them two children. By the early 1990s,
          the SEC and the FBI were involved in investigating the company's rampant
          corruption and fraud on Wall Street, by tapping their phones. Belfort
          proceeded to hide his own windfall profits in offshore and Swiss bank
          accounts. By 1998, Belfort was arrested by the FBI and persistent agent
          Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) due to overwhelming evidence of his
          illegalities, and his downfall was clearly imminent. He agreed to a
          more lenient sentence by wiring himself to squeal on other co-conspirators,
          but didn't carry through on his commitment. Belfort's company was shut
          down and he received an unusually-short sentence of 36 months in a
          minimum security prison. After his early release at 22 months, Belfort's
          new strategy was to offer financial Straight Line seminars to hopeful
          investors on profitable sales techniques and money-making schemes.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><b>World War Z (2013)</b>, 116 minutes (or 123 minutes
          unrated), D: Marc Forster<br />
          Marc Forster's action-thriller and zombie-creature film 
          (the highest-grossing (domestic) zombie film to date) was set in
          a time of many global zombie uprisings and outbreaks over a period
          of years, caused by a highly-contagious, infectious disease-virus.
           It was based on Max Brooks' 2006 novel of the same name about an apocalyptic
          zombie war. The story opened in a Philadelphia traffic jam, experienced
          by ex-UN investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) - with his wife Karin
          (Mireille Enos) and their two daughters. Suddenly, chaos, explosions,
          and an attack of zombies signaled a growing zombie pandemic-plague.
          Bitten individuals were suddenly reanimated in just a few seconds to
          join the hordes of fast-moving, infected, rampaging undead maniacs.
          Gerry was sent on a worldwide mission, in a race against time, to discover
          clues to the source of the rapidly-spreading, threatening disease.
          While his family was evacuated and protected on a UN-sponsored US Navy
          fleet stationed offshore in the Atlantic Ocean, Gerry studied the problem
          to try to determine the root cause or origin - and realized he must
          locate patient zero. His travels took him to South Korea, and then
          to Jerusalem (where a safe zone wall protected the uninfected until
          the zombies scaled the wall and overtook the city). He witnessed that
          zombies avoided attacking the sick, injured, terminally-ill, and elderly
          people (unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction). His next stop was
          a World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory outpost in Cardiff, Wales
          - during the plane ride, zombies infected almost all the passengers
          and Gerry was forced to use a hand-grenade and crash the plane during
          its landing. After suffering a blackout and coma, Gerry was feared
          dead and his family were returned to the mainland at Nova Scotia. As
          an antidote to the virus, he suggested inoculating the uninfected with
          pathogens which would be curable, to disguise them from the ravaging
          zombies. In the WHO lab, swarming with zombies, Gerry took a desperate
          chance and injected himself with one of the vials of unidentified pathogens
          - and realized that the zombies ignored him. His theory was a success.
          He collected more samples of the effective pathogen, retreated, and
          was soon cured of the disease - hopefully saving the world from annihilation
          with the masking 'vaccine' agent that was delivered to troops battling
          the zombies. </font></p></td>
