          <p><font size="2"><strong>An Affair to Remember (1957)</strong>, 115
              minutes, D: Leo McCarey<br />
              Director Leo McCarey's romantic tearjerker melodramatic tale of
              star-crossed lovers was a CinemaScopic remake of McCarey's original
              shipboard romance classic <i>Love Affair (1939)</i>, starring Irene
              Dunne and Charles Boyer. It was also  referenced in director
              Nora Ephron's <i>Sleepless in Seattle (1993)</i> and in <i>Love
              Affair (1994)</i> with Warren
          Beatty and Annette Bening. In the film's early scenes,  at
          the end of a transatlantic ocean cruise (from Europe to New York) before
          their ship <i>USS Constitution</i> docked in NYC, wealthy playboyish
          bachelor (and talented painter) Nickie Ferrante (Cary Grant) and former
          nightclub singer Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr) had formed a strong friendship;
          however, the two  were both involved with other relationships:
          Nickie was soon to marry his lovely, wealthy celebrity fianc&eacute;e
          Lois Clarke (Neva Patterson) - a rich heiress, and Terry had a long-time
          boyfriend named Kenneth Bradley (Richard Denning). Nonetheless, the
          two decided to reunite six months later (on July 1st at 5:00 pm) at
          the top (102nd floor) of the Empire State Building, as Terry added: &quot;Oh
          yes, that's perfect. It's the nearest thing to heaven we have in New
          York.&quot; Six months later when Nickie waited at
            their rendezvous point (a clock chimed 5 times), Terry didn't
            appear (she was injured in an awful car accident (off-screen) on
            a busy NYC street on her way rushing to meet him) and there were
            ambulances heard blaring at 10 minutes after five. Nickie assumed
              that he had been rejected and subsequently resumed his painting
          career. Although disabled, Terry took work as a music teacher for orphaned
          children. In the conclusion of the tale, there came a startling
            revelation scene six months later on Christmas Eve - regarding the
            devastating, terrible secret of why she couldn't keep her fateful
            appointment with him atop the Empire State Building - he visited
            her in her apartment as she remained unmoving and supine on a couch
            (he was unaware of her injury); he delivered an accusatory and scolding
          conversation with her. Nickie  gave Terry a Christmas
            present of a shawl from his now-deceased Grandmother Janou (Cathleen
            Nesbitt)  [Note: Earlier, during
            their ship's docking at Madeira, Nickie and Terry took a sidetrip
            to his grandmother's hillside villa. At their departure, the Grandmother
          promised to send Terry her beautiful white lace shawl one day.] 
		  As he was leaving after they diplomatically shook hands, he casually
          mentioned that he had once painted a picture similar to the way she
          looked: &quot;You
          know, I painted you like that with the shawl. I wish you could have
          seen it...I didn't think I could ever part with it. But well, there
          was no reason to keep it any longer, and, uh, I couldn't take money
          for it, because, well, you know..&quot;  He had agreed to have the
          painting given away free to a woman in a wheelchair who liked it, but
          had no money - &quot;She was...&quot; - and then suddenly, he became
          suspicious about why Terry was immobile on the couch, paused and went
          into the adjoining bedroom.  In Terry's bedroom, he discovered that
          she was the one who had acquired his painting - it was hanging on the
            wall (visible when the camera slowly panned right to show the painting's
            mirror reflection in the room) - she was the recipient of his painting!
          and had kept her accident a secret. After returning to the living room,
          Nickie stared disbelieving at Terry, who requested: &quot;Darling,
          don't look at me like that&quot;; he had made the ultimate discovery
          and deduction by inferring the devastating, terrible secret of how
          fate had intervened on the day they were to meet - he asked: &quot;Why
          didn't you tell me? If it had to happen to one of us, why did it have
          to be you?&quot; With a tearful
          hug, she explained: &quot;It was nobody's fault but my own. I-I was
            looking up. It was the <i>nearest</i> thing to heaven. You were there.
            Oh, darling, don't, don't worry, darling. If you can paint, I can
          walk. <i>Anything</i> can happen. Don't you think?&quot; He wiped away
          her tears and replied: &quot;Yes, darling, yes. Yes, yes, yes&quot;;
          they kissed, and a chorus sang atop a snowy view of New York City: &quot;Our
          Love Affair To Remember&quot; as the film concluded. </font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>The Bachelor Party (1957)</b>, 92 minutes, D: 
            Delbert Mann<br />
          Scriptwriter Paddy Chayefsky adapted his own 1953 teleplay (airing on <i>The
              Philco Television Playhouse</i>) for this feature-length male angst drama
            - an ensemble film. The intimate film told about the loneliness, insecurities,
            anxieties and frustrations of five middle-class, co-working male bookkeepers.
            At first glance, they appeared to be debonair and carefree. They held
            a bachelor party in a restaurant for thirtyish, timid and virginal Arnold
            Craig (Philip Abbott), who was about to be married to a war widow. The
            group included: protagonist Charlie Samson (Don Murray), older married
            asthma-suffering Walter (E.G. Marshall), swinging bachelor Eddie Watkins
            (Jack Warden), and henpecked married man Kenneth (Larry Blyden). During
            the party and night-clubbing/bar-hopping later on in the evening, all
            the characters began to reflect on their lives, concerns and issues about
            love and marriage. Staid, hard-working, struggling married man Charlie
            had second thoughts about his own marital ties (with newly-pregnant wife
            Helen (Patricia Smith)) - he felt trapped, restless and bored, and maybe
            not ready for fatherhood. The troubled Charlie was tempted to have a
            one-night affair with a young, footloose 'good-time-girl' bohemian -
            credited as the Existentialist (Oscar-nominated Carolyn Jones), whom
            he met on the way to Greenwich Village. After a few drinks, Walter revealed
            himself as a pathetic, despairing and self-loathing hypochondriac, who
            was sacrificing his health to keep his boy in school. The nervous groom-to-be
            Arnold also became ambivalent and fearful about his impending marriage
            and called off the nuptials (although he sobered up and changed his mind),
            and desperate bachelor Eddie (who was initially envied for his carefree,
            lady-killing existence) was still alone and struggling to pick up a woman
        at the bar. </font></p></td>

                  Kwai (1957)</a>,</b> 161 minutes, D: David Lean<br />
            Director David Lean's spectacular, acclaimed, all-time great WWII
            epic drama, and Best Picture-winning film was about British P.O.W.'s
            forced to construct a railway bridge over the River Kwai in the Asian
            jungle of Burma to connect a rail-line
            from Bangkok to Rangoon. The anti-war film was based on an outstanding,
            psychologically complex adaptation of Pierre Boulle's 1952 novel.
            In its opening, British soldiers arrogantly marched into the sweltering
            jungle prison camp to the whistling tune of the &quot;Colonel Bogey
            March.&quot; The prisoner-soldiers were led by an obstinate
            commander Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness), and ordered to build a
            rail bridge by the camp commander Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). They
            would unwittingly aid the war effort of their
            Japanese captors. Through the film, an antagonistic battle leading
            to a standoff  existed between the two stubborn
            wills of indomitable British Colonel Nicholson and the Japanese Colonel
            Saito, about whether officers should work along with the other men
            - after Nicholson called his attention to Article 27 of the Geneva
            Convention. Ultimately, Nicholson was allowed to  take charge of
            supervising the bridge's construction, and he established a twisted
            sense of pride in his fortified creation to show up the Japanese
            as inferior. Major Clipton (James Donald) questioned Nicholson's
            objectives: &quot;Must we build them a better bridge than they could have
            built for themselves?&quot; In the suspenseful
            finale, Nicholson discovered dynamite wires that had been secretly
            planted by his Allied (British and American intelligence) forces
            to blow up the structure,  led by cynical American 
            ex-prisoner and heroic escapee Commander Shears (William Holden)
            and British commando Major Warden (Jack Hawkins). Overnight, the
            water level of the river had fallen and exposed the wires. There
            was unbearable tension as the Japanese troop train was heard approaching the bridge and the
            commandos prepared to blow up the bridge. Foolishly, Nicholson
              attempted to save his bridge, and then uttered his
              moral dilemma (&quot;What have I done?&quot;), and fell lethally-wounded on the dynamite
          plunger. The question arose: Had he deliberately fallen on the plunger
              or was it accidental? The railroad bridge and the train were climactically
              destroyed, with the film's final words spoken by Clipton: &quot;Madness...madness,
          madness.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

        97 minutes, D: Mikhail Kalatozov</font><br />
          <font size="2">This realistic, post-Stalin Soviet romantic melodrama
          about the effects of World War II on a blissful, loving couple in the
          Soviet Union won the Grand Prize (Palme d'Or) at the Cannes Film Festival
          in 1958. The expressionistic B/W cinematography was beautifully realized,
          with stunning, mobile hand-held 35 mm camera shots. The plotline, based
          on a play by Viktor Rusov, was set in Moscow in 1941 at the time of
          the sudden German invasion of Russia. Its title came from the opening
          sequence in which the two protagonists, engaged lovers Veronika (Tatyana
          Samoylova) and young engineering student Boris Fyodorovich Borodin
          (Aleksey Batalov), watched as cranes ascended into the sky at sunrise.
          When they returned to their apartments after their secret rendezvous,
          with plans to return to the river bank, the patriotic-minded, responsible-minded
          factory worker Boris joined the army and was immediately deployed to
          the front. It was the day before Veronika's birthday, and he was unable
          to say goodbye to her. However, he left her a stuffed squirrel toy
          (&quot;squirrel&quot; was
          Boris' endearing nickname for Veronika) in a basket with a love-note
          inside as a birthday gift. [Note: Veronika did not see the farewell
          love note that ended with Boris' affirmation: &quot;...But we'll be
          happy yet. I love you. I have faith in you. Yours, Boris.] During the
          war, Veronika was devastated when a German air-raid destroyed her home
          and killed her parents. The orphaned Veronika was offered to live with
          Boris' family by Boris' physician father Fyodor Ivanovich Borozdin
          (Vasiliy Merkurev). During a Nazi air raid, Boris' forceful cousin,
          concert pianist Mark Aleksandrovich Borozdin (Aleksandr Shvorin), who
          was angry after being rebuffed by Veronika, raped her. Soon after,
          the exhausted, emotionally-broken and vulnerable Veronika made the
          fateful decision to marry Mark, although they despised each other and
          were miserable together, and Boris' family thought Veronika had betrayed
          Boris who was by now considered missing-in-action. On the war front,
          Boris saved a fellow soldier named Volodya (Konstantin Kadochnikov),
          but was lethally wounded and died while having an unfulfilled vision
          of a wedding to Veronika. The Borozdin family was forced to flee and
          relocate in Siberia, where Veronika worked as a wartime-nurse in an
          overcrowded military hospital managed by Boris' father. In the hospital,
          Veronika listened as injured soldier Volodya spoke judgmentally about
          unfaithful women who gave up their relationships during the war. She
          became overwhelmed with guilt that she had abandoned Boris and was
          unworthy of him. The self-loathing Veronika threatened suicide by
          jumping off a railway bridge, but was saved by the act of selflessly
          rescuing a young child (named Boris!) about to be hit by a car. Veronika
          went to retrieve Boris' toy squirrel gift to amuse the young boy at
          a party held by her promiscuous husband Mark for his mistress. She
          discovered the love note written by Boris to her. Fyodor learned of
          Mark's true lack of character as a no-good, cheating and draft-dodging
          husband, who had used bribes to avoid being drafted into the Soviet
          Army, and also had abused Veronika. As a result, Mark was thrown out,
          and Veronika's reputation was rehabilitated and restored. The young
          boy became part of her family. During the film's ending once the war
          had ended in 1945, and Veronika had returned to live in Moscow, she
          received confirmation at the train station - where troops on Victory
          Day were returning - that Boris had indeed died during combat. She
          offered flowers from her bouquet to the military families and their
          loved ones. A sign that better times were on the horizon was signaled
          by the return of cranes flying in formation over Moscow, rather than
          &quot;birds of war.&quot; The film concluded with a speech delivered
           by Boris' friend Stepan (Valentin Zubkov): &quot;...But
          we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield. Time will
          pass. Towns and villages will be rebuilt. Our wounds will heal. But
          our fierce hatred of war will never diminish. We share the grief of
          those who cannot meet their loved ones today, and we will do everything
          to insure that sweethearts are never again parted by war, that mothers
          need never again fear for their children's lives, that fathers need
          never again choke back hidden tears. We have won, and we shall live
          not to destroy, but to build a new life!&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              Elia Kazan<br />
              Director Elia Kazan's powerful and satirical political drama illustrated
              how a jailed, down-home country boy in the late 1950s could be
              transformed overnight into a media celebrity on the radio, and
              later become a mean-spirited political demagogue and megalomaniac
              on TV. In the opening sequence, Larry &quot;Lonesome&quot; Rhodes
              (Andy Griffith in his film debut) - an opportunistic, smiling,
              drunken cornpone-spouting, back country homeless man, was first
              heard strumming his bluesy guitar in a rural jail-cell, in the
              fictional town of Pickett in northeast Arkansas. He had been taken
              in the previous night for being &quot;drunk
              and disorderly.&quot;  KGRK radio reporter/producer
              Marcia Jeffries (Neal) conducted her local radio show (&quot;A
              Face in the Crowd&quot;) from the cell and became transfixed when
              she heard him sing the home-spun song &quot;Free Man in the Morning.&quot; Afterwards,
              Rhodes was brought to Memphis, Tennessee to appear on TV, and introduced
              to bookish, well-educated staff writer Mel Miller (Walter Matthau).
              Soon, the new con-artist/star would be making commercial pitches
              in New York for a product known as Vitajex - a dietary supplement
              promoted to increase energy and sexual virility. In a revealing
              bedroom scene with Marcia, Rhodes revealed his disturbing, arrogant
              and power-hungry intentions that his audience would sheepishly
              follow him anywhere, and be directed to wherever he wished: (&quot;They're
              mine. I own 'em. They think like I do. Only they're even more stupid
              than I am, so I gotta think for 'em. Marcia, you just wait and
              see. I'm gonna be the power behind the President, and you'll be
              the power behind me. You made me, Marcia. You made me. I always
              say that. I owe it all to you. I owe it all to you.&quot;).
              In a side story, although Rhodes proposed marriage to Marcia, he
              became infatuated with teenaged, 17 year-old baton twirler Betty
              Lou Fleckum (Lee Remick in her screen debut), and eloped with her,
              and then engaged in a 50-50 business partnership with Marcia. On
              a number of occasions, Rhodes expressed how disrespectful, fraudulent
              and hypocritical he was. When concluding his national TV show (&quot;The
              Cracker Barrel&quot;),
              thinking that his microphone had been cut off (but was deliberately
              turned back on by Marcia to expose his duplicity), he showed his
              utter contempt for his mass audience by personally and nastily
              insulting them as stupid morons. In the stunning conclusion of
              his inevitable melt-down and spectacular downfall, drunken and
              delusional rabble-rouser Rhodes was in his  swanky hotel two-floor
              penthouse for a fancy dinner party of political elites, to advance
              his own political agenda, where he found an empty room attended
              only by black butlers and servants, and he threatened to commit
              suicide after being disowned by his previous adoring public. Although
              Rhodes was finished for the time being, Miller predicted that it
              might only be a temporary setback.</font></p></td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Funny Face (1957), </b>103 minutes, D: Stanley
              Donen<br />
              Originally, <i>Funny Face</i> was a 1920s stage musical starring
              Fred Astaire and his sister Adele. When the production eventually
              reached Broadway in late 1927, it was a tremendous hit. The Stanley
              Donen-directed 1957 romantic comedy-musical again starred Astaire
              and featured winning songs by the Gershwins, although the plot
              was significantly changed. In this iteration, New York City's <i>Quality</i> fashion
              magazine editor Maggie Prescott (Kay Thompson) (based upon <i>Harper's
              Bazaar</i> editor Diana Vreeland) and her top fashion photographer
              Dick Avery (Fred Astaire, about 3 decades older than Hepburn) (based
              upon Richard Avedon) were looking for a model (a &quot;Quality Woman&quot;)
              who was both beautiful and intellectual. In a small Greenwich Village
              bookshop (&quot;Embryo Concepts&quot;) that was used as a photo backdrop,
              the mess created during the impromptu and intrusive photo-shoot
              upset the store's shy, withdrawn and bookish clerk, Jo Stockton
              (Audrey Hepburn in her first musical). Amateur philosopher Jo revealed
              her belief in &quot;empathacalism&quot; to Avery, and remained cool to his
              romantic advances and kisses. Dick was enamoured by Jo's fresh
              and intellectual look (her &quot;funny face&quot;) and promoted her to Maggie,
              who was in the process of selecting a 'quality' woman to photograph
              in Paris. Jo reluctantly agreed to go to Paris (mostly to attend
              a philosophical lecture by her 'idol' - Professor Emile Flostre
              (Michel Auclair), empathacalism's founder). In addition, she would
              serve as a model for Paris-based Paul Duval's (Robert Flemyng)
              designer clothes. In the City of Lights during a touring travelogue
              of photos for the fashion event, Jo and Dick began to fall in love.
              Filmed in soft-focus  in the green countryside at the
              Chantilly churchyard near Paris, Jo was photographed  in a wedding
              bridal dress. She confessed her love for him and the two danced:
              (&quot;He Loves and She Loves&quot;). Ultimately, Jo's interest in Flostre
              fell apart when he was revealed to be more desirous of her physically
              than intellectually, and she knocked him over the head with a vase.
              She then wholeheartedly participated in the magazine's fashion
              show finale, and was able to reconcile with Dick (who became disconsolate
              when he thought Jo was no longer interested in him and was ready
              to leave Paris). In the fairy-tale ending, they again reunited
              in the garden at the small country church - and sang together &quot;'S

              D: John Sturges<br />
              Hollywood's ahistorical version of the Wyatt Earp-Doc Holliday
              legends, focusing on the years 1879 to 1881, was also
              dramatized in director Allan Dwan's <i>Frontier Marshal (1939)</i> with
              Randolph Scott, John Ford's <i><a href="myda.html">My
              Darling Clementine (1946)</a></i> and
              the more recent <i>Tombstone (1993)</i> and <i>Wyatt Earp (1994)</i>. The film's tagline tauted
              its main feature: &quot;The Wildest Gunfight in the History of the West.&quot;
              It was derived from a screenplay by novelist Leon Uris, and based
          on a 1954 article in <i>Holiday Magazine</i> titled <i>The Killer</i> by
          George Scullin. The film opened with sequences set in Dodge City, Kansas
          and Fort Griffin, Texas, to set up the subsequent action and introduce
          the characters. After his long career as a legendary lawman, the upright Wyatt Earp (Burt
            Lancaster)  with his love interest - poker gambler Laura Denbow
            (Rhonda Fleming),  moved to Tombstone, Arizona to help clean
            up the town and help his brother Virgil (John Hudson) - Tombstone's
            town marshal. Others helping them were Morgan Earp (DeForest Kelley)
          and the youngest Earp brother James (Martin Milner). Also in Tombstone
              was Earp's reluctant ally, terminally-ill gambler John &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday
              (Kirk Douglas) who amused himself in a tempestuous relationship
          with trampish Kate Fisher (Jo Van Fleet). Complications arose after
           Kate joined up with powerful thieving cattle rustler Ike Clanton's
          (Lyle Bettger) wily hired gun Johnny Ringo (John Ireland), and young
          James Earp was shot and killed during a mistaken-identity ambush. The
          western concluded with a 5-minute bloodbath shooting at the O.K. Corral
          - a showdown between the Earps and Clantons. In the film's version,
          all six in Clanton's gang were killed, including young Billy Clanton
          (Dennis Hopper) who was given a chance to surrender, but refused. <br />
            <br />
          [Note: In reality, the shootout on
          October 26, 1881 did not take place in or next to the O.K. Corral,
          and was over in 30 seconds, with an exchange of 34 bullets, and the
          deaths of three men: Billy Clanton and two McLaury brothers (Tom
          and Frank). Virgil, Morgan, and Holliday were wounded. After
          the stand-off, the Earp Brothers were immediately arrested for murder
        and put on trial, but were acquitted for acting lawfully.] </font></p>        </td>

              D: Jack Arnold<br />
              Director Jack Arnold's existential, allegorical science-fiction
              film with fantastic special effects told about a shrunken, miniscule human being. The
              landmark film was based on author Richard Matheson's adaptation
              of his own 1956 novel. In the opening sequence, Robert &quot;Scott&quot; Carey
            (Grant Williams) was contaminated by exposure to nuclear radiation/waste,
            when during a vacation off the California coast, his boat came
            into contact with a strange, misty white cloud above the water
            and covered his chest with white glittering particles. His wife
            escaped exposure due to being below deck. Over 
            a period of months, after being accidentally exposed to a pesticide
            (a triggering effect), Scott  gradually
             began to shrink in size as he lost weight and stature, compared
            to his wife Louise Carey (Randy Stuart). He realized that his
           clothes didn't fit, and that he was losing both weight and stature. He
            voiced his concerns to family physician Dr. Arthur Bramson (William
            Schallert), followed by numerous tests at the California Medical
          Research Institute led by Dr. Thomas Silver (Raymond Bailey). &quot;Shrinking
          Man&quot; Scott suggested to Louise that she was free to leave him,
          exemplified by his wedding ring limply slipping from his finger.  Scott
          was attacked by his now-dangerous house cat Butch (Orangey), and was
          forced to hide for refuge in a miniature doll house before he was forced
          down into his home's  basement. Louise expressed fears
          that the cat ate him, with KIRL TV broadcasting the news (John Hiestand): &quot;From
          Los Angeles today, a tragic story. The passing of Robert Scott Carey.
          The report of the death of the so-called Shrinking Man comes from his
          brother. Carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house
          cat -- a former pet in the Carey home.&quot; Now three inches in height
          and in retreat in the basement, he unsuccessfully attempted to snatch
          a piece of stale cheese from a giant mousetrap, and attempted to reach
              some moldy dry cake. He obtained water from a leaky water heater,
              and sheltered himself in a matchbox, but then he nearly drowned
              (now 3 inches in height) when trapped in the flooded basement due
          to the busted, leaking water heater. Scott engaged
          in a deadly battle with a giant tarantula, seen with a close-up of
          its voracious mouth, when he was finally able to impale the threatening
          creature and kill it with a straight pin. In the final third of the
          film, the dialogue was non-existent except for Scott's narration of
          his own vulnerable, utterly alone and existential predicament, and
          the profound meaning and understanding he had of his fragile life.
           In the film's conclusion, Scott delivered a memorable enlightened
            philosophical speech - an epiphany of sorts - about being infinitesimal
              (now about one inch in height), as he stood before an enlarged
              basement window vent screen and escaped
          outdoors for a new beginning without fear. </font> </p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Richard Thorpe<br />
            This great black and white B rock-n-roll film has often been voted
            as the best, most popular, and most famous of Elvis Presley's musicals
            (his third film out of over 30 films from the late 50s through the
            60s) - the plot even slightly paralleled the rocker's own life. This
          pre-Army film was filled with Presley classics, especially the wonderfully-choreographed
          set piece for   &quot;Jailhouse Rock,&quot; as well as the other memorable
          numbers including &quot;I Want to Be Free,&quot; &quot;Treat Me Nice,&quot; &quot;You're
          So Square (Baby, I Don't Care),&quot; and the two tender ballads: &quot;Young
          and Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Don't Leave Me Now.&quot; In the film's
          opening, cocky, quick-tempered 19 year-old construction worker Vince
          Everett (Elvis Presley) was goaded into a bar-room brawl that led to
          a drunken man's death. Vince was charged with accidental manslaughter
          and sentenced to serve a one-to-ten year jail term. While in jail,
          his middle-aged cellmate Hunk Houghton (Mickey Shaughnessy), a washed-up,
          former veteran country singer serving time for armed robbery, mentored
          him to learn guitar and sing, and persuaded him to enter the prison's
          inmate talent show. Vince's raw and untamed performance was broadcast
          on national television and resulted in tons of fan mail, but the jealous
          Hunk deceptively withheld the letters from Vince, and convinced him
          to sign a contract that made them equal partners. During
          his release from incarceration after 14-months, budding rock star and
          ex-con parolee Vince learned about Hunk's deception via the warden.
          Struggling to break into the competitive record business and music
          industry, at a nightclub, Vince met Peggy
          Van Alden (Judy Tyler), a promoter for another   pop singer
          named Mickey Alba.  After being ripped off by Alba who stole and recorded
          Vince's single &quot;Don't
          Leave Me Now&quot; with Geneva Records, Vince
          decided to form his own record label known as Laurel Records, and he
          hired  attorney Mr. Shores (Vaughn Taylor) to handle the finances.
          He soon became an overnight sensation with  DJ Teddy Talbot's (Dean
          Jones) promotion of his recording of &quot;Treat
          Me Nice.&quot; Ex-con Vince was also invited to appear in New York on
          a nationwide NBC-TV variety show to sing his hip-swiveling headlining
          song: &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; set in a stylized jail cell. 
		  He delivered an introductory
          prologue about his life in prison where he had first started singing
          'Jailhouse Rock'. Vince reconciled with his former
          cellmate Hunk, and although their prison contract was deemed worthless,
          Vince promised to provide Hunk with a fee of 10% of his earnings. After
          being seduced by the decadent lifestyle of a pop star, however, Vince
          became rebellious, self-centered, and unwilling to work with Hunk or
           Peggy, his loyal and pretty girlfriend/talent scout/record promoter.
          In Hollywood while filming a movie with Climax Studios, Vince fell
          in love with his conceited, stuck-up leading lady co-actress Sherry
          Wilson (Jennifer Holden). The mercenary, egotistical Vince considered
          an offer from Geneva Records to purchase Laurel Records, although Peggy
          advised him to not sell. During an altercation with Hunk who was defending
          Peggy, Vince was punched in the neck (voice-box larynx) and temporarily
          lost his singing voice - endangering his singing career. During his
          hospitalization and recovery, Vince set his priorities straight. He
          proclaimed his love for Peggy by singing &quot;Young and Beautiful&quot; to Peggy
          with his healed voice. [Note:
          Judy Tyler (formerly Princess Summerfall Winterspring on the <em>Howdy
          Doody</em> TV show) tragically died in a car crash before the film was released.] </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Mother India (1957, India) (aka Bharat Mata)</b>,
              172 minutes, D: Mehboob Khan<br />
              Director Mehboob Khan's melodramatic, nationalistic epic account
              (three hours in length with numerous musical numbers) told about
               a poverty-stricken yet courageous peasant woman in India. It was
              a remake of his own earlier film <i>Aurat (Woman) (1940, India)</i>,
              and a defining Indian film shot with the Gevacolor process. It
               was also the first film from India to be nominated for an Academy
              Award in the Best Foreign Film category. Told in the Hindi language
              (with subtitles), it was a Bollywood story of Indian rural life,
              motherhood, and good vs. evil that equated a resilient, dutiful,
              strong and proud peasant woman (&quot;mother figure&quot;) with
              the proud and newly-independent land of India. The film's opening
              was held at the inauguration of a dam and water pump allowing water
              to flow into village fields. The ceremony was presided over by
              an elderly woman named Radha (Nargis), the &quot;Mother India&quot; of
              the village who held a piece of earth in her hands. This initial
              sequence set up an extended flashback to her entire adult life
              - she recalled her past while smelling a flower garland around
              her neck. In a flashback occurring at the time of Radha's
              expensive marriage to her farmer husband Shamu (Raaj Kumar) around
              50 years earlier, a major issue arose for the rest of Radha's life.
               The local, evil, crooked, lecherous and deceptive moneylender
              Sukhilala (Kanhaiya Lal) swindled Radha's mother-in-law at the
              time of her lavish wedding with a high-interest loan-contract that
              took three-fourths of her produce. Tragedy struck Radha when her
              husband lost both his arms in a farm accident - they were crushed
              by a boulder that he was attempting to move. The long-suffering
              and courageous heroine Radha was then faced with a predicament
              - she decided to unselfishly sacrifice herself to care for her
              family of sons: (1) her younger son - the arrogant, mean, rebellious,
              irresponsible and spiteful Birju (Sunil Dutt), and (2) her elder
              son - the devoted, sober, responsible and calm Ramu (Rajendra Kumar)
              [Note: A third son died in infancy.] Due to Shamu's tragic accident
              and growing debts and starvation, the disabled, humiliated, and
              shamed Shamu abandoned his family. He disappeared into the night
          and never returned (and presumably died). Radha
          was seen pulling the plow (as a plow animal) when the cow died, and
          she was forced to dig in the mud to find food. A
          massive storm and flood brought starvation and devastation to the village.
          To save her children, Radha supplicated herself by submitting herself
          to moneylender Sukhilala, but due to her ultimate pride and honor,
          she beat off his advances and refused to offer sex (and marriage to
          him) in exchange for food, in order to keep both her integrity and
          chastity. There were tragic consequences: Radha's enraged
              younger son Birju vengefully attacked moneylender Sukhilala and
              his daughter Rupa (Chanchal), and was subsequently excommunicated
          from the village. Birju became a roaming, anarchist bandit who
            returned on the wedding day of Sukhilala's daughter Rupa 
            - he stabbed Sukhilala to death in the chest and kidnapped the
          daughter. Consequently, Radha confronted Birju for his undisciplined
            immorality, and with a shotgun, aimed and shot at him as he rode
            off on horseback with the captive daughter Rupa in his arms. Radha
            ran to him, held him as he stumbled towards her, and comforted him
          as he bloodily died in her arms. In the final image, Radha's bloody
          hands that were embracing a dying Birju dissolved back to the film's
          opening - the inauguration of a newly-constructed irrigation canal
          - where bloody-red water was released down a sluice-way to irrigate
          the crops.</font></p>          </td>

                Co-writer/director Federico Fellini's romantic melodrama, with
                a wonderful musical score by Nino Rota, won the Best
                Foreign Language Film Oscar awarded in 1958. [Note: Fellini's <i>La
                Strada (1954, It.)</i>,
                also starring Giulietta Masina (Fellini's wife), won the inaugural
                Best Foreign Language Film Oscar awarded in 1956.] The 1966
                Broadway stage musical <i>Sweet Charity</i> directed
        and choreographed by Bob Fosse (and Fosse's feature film directorial
                debut and adaptation <i>Sweet
        Charity (1969) </i>with
        Shirley MacLaine) both paid homage to Fellini's plot-line. </font><font size="2">The
        principal title character of the post-war Italian neo-realistic film
        was Maria 'Cabiria' Ceccarelli  - a waifish, short-statured, optimistic-minded,
        naive, overly-trusting, independent street-walking prostitute in the
        city of Rome, who sought clients in the Passeggiata Archeologica of Rome's
        Parco di Porta Capena. The isolated and disgraced outcast was often wearing
        a striped blouse, a ratty fake fur jacket and ankle bobby socks. [Note:
        Her movements and actions recalled Charlie Chaplin's comic Little Tramp
        character.] In the film's playful opening, Cabiria unexpectedly became
        the victim of her live-in client-lover (and pimp) Giorgio (Franco Fabrizi),
        who stole her purse with 40,000 lire and nearly drowned her in a canal.
        It was the first of many similiar humiliations and degradations that
        the heroine would experience in various episodes or vignettes as she
        went on a personal odyssey to search for true love. One night while outside
        a nightclub in the Via Veneto, the starstruck Cabiria met jaded and recently-jilted
        movie star Alberto Lazzari (Amedeo Nazzari), who after dancing the mambo
        with her at a different club, invited her to his palatial house. Upon
        the return of Lazzari's glamorous, irritated girlfriend to the mansion
        later that evening, Cabiria (hidden and locked in the bathroom with the
        dog) watched as Alberto reconciled with her after their earlier argument
        at the club. That evening, she observed a nameless
        &quot;Man with the Sack&quot; (Leo Catozzo) - a saintly 'good samaritan' feeding
        and providing for vagrants and poverty-stricken cave dwellers, including
        one of Cabiria's elderly and once-beautiful ex-colleagues - it was a
        possible premonition of her own coming fate. </font><font size="2">A
        few days later during a religious pilgrimage and church mass with other
        prostitutes and pimps at the Shrine of Divine Love, she prayed to a statue
        of the Virgin Mary, vainly hoping for a better life (&quot;Madonna, Madonna,
        help me to change my life. Bestow your grace on me too. Make me change
        my life&quot;). During a magic show in a vaudeville theatre, the drunk Cabiria
              was called upon by the magician-wizard (Aldo Silvani) to be hypnotized
              on stage. Introduced to an invisible suitor named Oscar, she became
              the object of heckling and ridicule from the audience about her
              desired wish to be married to someone who truly loved her. An accountant
              named Oscar D'Onofrio (Fran&ccedil;ois
            P&eacute;rier) who witnessed the show, was
            sympathetic to her plight. After getting to know each other better
            and he proposed, Cabiria fell in love with Oscar and announced plans
            to marry him in two weeks. Her streetwalker friend Wanda (Franca
            Marzi) cautioned her about selling her shack-house and belongings,
            and withdrawing all of her money (700,000 lire, her dowry) from her
            bank account. Cabiria became suspicious of Oscar's ruthless and dishonorable
            motives when his attitude changed during a walk in a wooded forest
            with high cliffs above a lake. When she realized his true intentions,
            she threw her money at him, begged to die, and was left writhing
            on the ground covered in dead leaves and dirt as he stole her purse
            and abandoned her. After being devastated and humiliated once again,
            as Cabiria returned to town, she encountered teenaged revelers happily
            forming a circus-like parade as they danced and played music. In
            the film's redemptive coda, the ever-hopeful and undefeated Cabiria
            - with her spirits lifted - joined the impromptu group and gave a
            transcendent, hopeful and bittersweet teary smile - the last image
            was of a single black tear falling from her left eye. </font></p>        </td>

              Abbott, Stanley Donen<br />
              Stanley Donen and Broadway stage director George Abbott co-directed
              this likeable, enthusiastically-performed late 50s Warners' musical,
              based upon the 1953 novel <i>7 1/2 Cents</i> by Richard Bissell
              and the earlier Tony Award-winning Broadway show (co-directed by
              George Abbott and Jerome Robbins). It opened in 1954 (and played
          through 1959) and won the Tony Award in 1955. Over a third of the cast
          were retained from the original Broadway show, including eleven of
          the play's fifteen songs - resulting in the faithful retention of much
          of the flavor, freshness, and originality of the hit musical. John
          Raitt was retained from the stage version, but lead female Doris Day
          replaced Janis Paige. The
          film's taglines were: &quot;This little old world
              wouldn't be the same without that extra special fun of <i>The Pajama
              Game</i>,&quot; and &quot;ALL THE BOY-CHASES-GIRL-CHASES-BOY ENTERTAINMENT
              OF THE RECORD-SMASHING BROADWAY HIT SENSATION!&quot; The
          career-defining, imaginative dancing sequences (with beautiful set
          designs) were staged by legendary choreographer Bob Fosse, who worked
          on both the stage play (his choreographic debut) and film versions.
          The follow-up Abbott/Donen film<i> Damn
          Yankees! (1958)</i>, their second Broadway adaptation, again featured
          Fosse's striking choreography. The predictable
          plotline was about a challenging romance that developed between two
          individuals who worked at Cedar Rapids Iowa's Sleep-Tite Pajama Factory.
          The two potential lovers were Katie (or Katherine) &quot;Babe&quot; Williams
          (Doris Day), the feisty workers' union representative of textile workers
          who served as the chair of the union's grievance committee, and Sid
          Sorokin (John Raitt), the new factory shop superintendent who was hired
          by the factory's cheap-minded executive-manager Myron &quot;Old Man&quot; Hasler
          (Ralph Dunn) to oppose the workers' demand for a pay raise. Conflict
          arose between the two during a 7.5 cents an hour pay raise dispute
          (at the time, calculated to be a 6% pay increase) and jeopardized
          their romance. One of Babe's strategies was to have the union orchestrate
           a work slow-down to bring further pressure, although it led to her
          firing by Sid. She continued to resist, and instituted  further strategies
          to sabotage the sewing of the PJs. The show-stopping
          hit song <i>Hernando's Hideaway</i> was the name of a local forbidden
          hot-spot/joint for secret rendezvous. In the resolution of the plot,
          Sid took Hasler's office secretary-sexpot Gladys Hotchkiss (Carol Haney)
          to the hideaway, got her drunk, and was able to persuade her to give
          him the key to her manager's locked account book. Sid learned that
          the manager had reported that the pay raise had already been instituted
          months ago, but he had been corruptly pocketing the profitable difference.
            Sid was able to pressure Hasler to agree to the workers' pay raise
            and announced the news to an in-progress Union Rally. With peace
            restored to the factory, Sid and Babe were able to reconcile and
            commence a true romance. </font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Stanley Kubrick<br />
          This classic, powerfully bleak, anti-war drama from
              Stanley Kubrick was about the hypocrisy of militarism and power
          - it was the first of his anti-war trilogy,
            including <a href="drst.html"><i>Dr. Strangelove Or:... (1964)</i></a> and <i>Full
            Metal Jacket (1987)</i>. The film was based on Humphrey Cobb's factual
            1935 novel, and became an effective denouncement of self-seeking,
            pitiless WWI French military leaders whose strategy and mishandling
            of a failed mission were incomprehensible. In 1916 during horrendous
            trench warfare on the French front (filmed with realistic tracking
            shots) against the Germans, a vain, scar-faced divisional French
              General  Paul Mireau (George Macready),  backed up by evil Corps
            Commander General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), ordered his hapless
            group of soldiers to suicidally attack an obviously-impenetrable
          German stronghold, dubbed the Ant-Hill. Mireau
          had been promised a promotion - another military star - for his efforts
          by General Broulard - a wily, cultivated but calloused, scheming and
          ruthless officer in the French High Command, who had commandeered a
          grand, stately, palatial chateau as his headquarters. There was an
          endless, absorbing and dramatic tracking shot of Mireau uncomfortably
          walking through the muddy trenches, speaking to various soldiers, along
          with distant sounds of exploding mortars, on his way to meet with 701st
          Infantry Regimental Commander Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) and pass on
          the responsibility for his foolish strategy for a catastrophic atack. 
           During the ill-conceived and failing attack (a
              gut-wrenching 10 minute-sequence), hundreds of
            soldiers were slaughtered by machine-gun fire in no man's land. Mireau
              angrily commanded his own artillery to fire on the 'cowardly' troops.
              As a cruel example to others,  three scapegoated soldiers were
              randomly selected to take the blame: Private Maurice Ferol (Timothy
              Carey), Corporal Philippe Paris (Ralph Meeker), and Private Pierre
              Arnaud (Joseph Turkel) - the blameless men were held responsible
              for the stupid blunders of the commanders, ordered to stand trial
              and be court-martialed for &quot;cowardice
              in the face of the enemy.&quot; Military commander
              and dissenting Army lawyer Colonel Dax, aware of the disgraceful
              cover-up and episode, volunteered to defend the condemned men.
              During the taut and compelling but sham court-martial trial sequence,
              held in the clean, gleaming, high-ceilinged ballroom of the luxurious
              chateau,  there were no prosecution witnesses,
              no indictment, and no stenographic record of the very unfair proceedings.
              The prosecutor argued for a guilty verdict for the condemned men. After
              an unsuccessful yet eloquent defense by Colonel Dax, he claimed
              that the trial was a farce (&quot;a mockery of all human justice&quot;).
              During incarceration, the condemned men were brought their last
              meal, and then the three faced execution
              by firing squad the next morning at 7 am dawn (a tense, 7-minute
              firing squad scene). Following the executions, Mireau was removed
              from command by Broulard, and the command job was offered to Dax
              - who refused to accept. During the scene of Dax's post-firing
              squad meeting with the evil General Broulard, he staunchly refused
              a self-serving promotion, and was then forced to apologize to the
              commander - but refused to do so. In the final tavern scene, a
              frightened, fragile, teary-eyed and innocent German blonde girl
              (Susanne Christian in the credits, actually Christiane Harlan,
              director Kubrick's future third and last wife) who had been captured
              was forced to sing a well-known German ballad for a group of Dax's
              French soldiers - a folk song of love in war, called &quot;The
              Faithful Soldier.&quot; The looks on their faces at first humiliated
              her, and then softened, as they listened empathically and understood
              her pain. The song evoked memories of their youth, their homes,
              and their loves in a world they might never see again. In the film's
              conclusion, Dax was outside the tavern, where he was watching and
              listening impassively. He received orders from Broulard to immediately
              return his unit to the front's trenches. To give his men the &quot;short&quot; rest
              they were promised but never fully received following the assault
              on Ant Hill, he postponed their deployment for a few more minutes. </font></p>          </td>

              Robson
              <br />
          Director Mark Robson's sanitized and toned-down, yet still torrid soap-opera
          adaptation of Grace Metalious' best-selling, shocking and scandalous
          1956 novel was about small-town repression, incest, suicide, rape,
          nudity, homosexuality, adultery, abortion, and patricidal murder. The
          opening credits and sequence portrayed calm, picture-postcard views
          of a New England town, Peyton Place. Two prominent families in town
          were - the MacKenzie family (composed of prudish, blonde, widowed dress
              shop owner Constance &quot;Connie&quot; MacKenzie (Oscar-nominated
              Lana Turner) and her studious HS senior daughter Allison MacKenzie
              (Diane Varsi)), and the Cross family (composed of alcoholic step-father
              Lucas Cross (Arthur Kennedy) - the school's custodian, his wife
              Nellie (Betty Field) - housekeeper for the MacKenzies, and two
              step-children: Paul Cross (William Lundmark) and Selena Cross (Hope
          Lange)). Idealistic newcomer to town Michael Rossi (Lee Philips),
              who was looking for employment, was hired as the new high school
              principal after being interviewed by local school board member
              and mill owner Mr. Harrington (Leon Ames) and the local doctor
          Dr. Matthew Swain (Lloyd Nolan). Two other major characters were  
              overtly-sexual, fast-living trampish sexpot Betty Anderson (Terry
          Moore) and her boyfriend Rodney Harrington
          (Barry Coe), son of wealthy mill owner (Leon Ames), who often caused
              trouble for 18 year old coming of age Allison, who began  a romantic
              relationship with nerdy, shy and virginal Norman Page (Russ Tamblyn).
               Tormented, wrong-side-of-the-tracks Selena Cross
              was forced to fight off the advances of her drunken stepfather
              Lucas Cross in their tarpaper shack, after she returned from a
              date with her boyfriend-fiancee, aspiring lawyer Ted Carter (David
            Nelson). During  the film's incestuous rape scene, her lecherous,
              alcoholic father attacked her on a bed.  She became
            pregnant and consulted with Dr. Swain, requesting an 'abortion' (the
            word was not used in the film); the outraged doctor, who promised
            to keep her situation a secret, threatened Lucas with jail-time,
            and was able to force him to sign a confession that he had fathered
            the child. When Selena returned home, she was again attacked
            by her  spiteful father; she fled from him into the woods, and fell
            - suffering a miscarriage; Dr. Swain reported his operation on her
            as 'appendicitis.' During a  vicious
            argument in the MacKenzie household after hearing the town's rumors
            about Allison, Connie stunningly revealed to her shocked daughter
            that she was born out of wedlock (illegitimate), and that she had
            been lied to about her father. Horrified by the revelation, Allison
            fled to her upstairs bedroom, where she found her mother's maid,
            Nellie Cross (Lucas' oppressed wife, who knew about the sexual attacks
            on Selena) dead from a suicidal hanging. During the war years, Betty
            was widowed when her married husband Rodney was killed in battle;
            and although he had always disapproved of Betty, Mr. Harrington kept
            his promise to his dead son to care for Betty and welcome her to
            the family. Also, Connie and the new HS principal Michael Rossi,
            who had been steadily interested in her, finally made plans to marry.
            Upon Lucas' return to the family's shack on Christmas Eve while he
            was serving in the Navy during WWII, Selena was forced to bludgeon
            her father to death with a piece of firewood during a second rape
            attempt, and then buried his body in the backyard. A few months later
            when Lucas was considered AWOL, Selena confessed her crime to Connie,
            who then reported the murder to the authorities. In the film's climactic
            courtroom trial for murder, during an unapologetic confessional testimony
            as a witness for the defense, Dr. Swain claimed that Selena's act
            of murder was not pre-meditated. He produced a signed confession
            from Lucas that stated the father's responsibility for Selena's pregnancy,
            and that she had fought him off in self-defense. In the film's ending,
            Allison was touchingly reconciled to her mother on the front steps
            of the MacKenzie house.</font></p></td>

        <p><font size="2"><b><a href="sayo.html">Sayonara (1957)</a></b>, 147 minutes, D: Joshua Logan<br />
        Director Joshua Logan's romantic-drama set in the early 1950s was about
            the issue of American soldiers serving in post-war Japan during the
            Korean War (1950-1953), who became romantically involved with indigenous
            Japanese natives in defiance of US military policy. West-Point educated
            Air Force Major Lloyd &quot;Ace&quot; Gruver
            (Marlon Brando) was transferred from the warfront in Korea and redeployed
            and stationed at a Japanese air base in Kobe. He was  ordered there
            specifically by General Webster (Kent Smith), the father of Gruver's
            own red-headed American fiancee Eileen (Patricia Owens) from Tulsa,
            Oklahoma, to confront enlisted Airman Joe
            Kelly (Oscar-winning Red Buttons), from marrying a Japanese &quot;native&quot; woman,
            Katsumi (Oscar-winning Miyoshi Umeki). Shortly later, he reluctantly
            found himself serving as 'best man' at the happy couple's wedding.
            He was also engaged to Eileen, but they had an unstable and disintegrating
            relationship. She feared that he would become like his father, a
            four-star general neglectful of his mother, and she didn't want to
            be married to him based on personal status alone, rather than for
            true passionate love. At the same time, Gruver became entranced and
            obsessed with the star performer Hana-ogi (Miiko Taka in her debut
            film) of the beautiful Japanese Matsubayashi Revue dancers. He ultimately
            was able to meet her in private at Kelly's house for dinner (she
            was friends with Katsumi), and they began a secretive love affair
            after she surprised Gruver by offering and submitting herself to
            him. Meanwhile, Kelly's bigoted commanding officer Colonel Crawford
            (Douglas Watson) convinced General Webster to agree with his suggestion
            to order a new regulation that would prohibit any further fraternizations
            between servicemen and local women. As a result, Kelly was told he
            would be shipped back to the US - without his wife (who was now pregnant).
            Angered, Gruver decided to divulge his own relationship with a Japanese
            woman and his plans to marry her: &quot;Kelly's from
            my outfit, Mrs. Webster. l was his best man. And l'm planning to
            marry a Japanese girl myself&quot;; it was also a pronouncement of
            his formal engagement breakup with Eileen. Both officers received
            punishment under the order: Kelly's house was boarded up, and he
            was told he would be shipped out in two days. And Gruver was placed
            under house arrest and urged to return to the US. He also learned
            that Hana-ogi was also being punished (although leniently) with an
            imminent transfer to Tokyo by the company for consorting with an
            American. Unfortunately, Kelly and Katsumi, who faced a life of separation,
            engaged in the practice of ritualized suicide (or <i>shinju)</i>,
            and were found dead in their home by Gruver. Instead of allowing
            his reassignment to the US, Gruver flew to Tokyo where Hana-ogi was
            now performing with her Japanese theater troupe. He was ultimately
            able to convince her to join him, and proceed to the American consulate
            to get married. The film's final line of dialogue was delivered by
            Gruver to  rival Japanese and American military reporters (from <i>Stars
            and Stripes</i>) about
            how he felt about the negative reaction they would receive: (&quot;Tell
            'em we said, 'Sayonara'). </font></p></td>

                Inseglet)</strong>, 96 minutes, D: Ingmar Bergman<br />
                Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's influential psychological,
                fantasy-drama and art-house film was considered a landmark masterpiece.
                The classic, existential, thought-provoking film questioned
                 serious religious issues concerning the existence of God, the
                afterlife, Death, and the loss of faith. The striking images
                throughout the film were due to the exquisite B/W cinematography
                of Gunnar Fischer. The film's title was derived from the Biblical
                Book of Revelation (chapter 8, verse 1). Many were aware that
                the film's stark imagery and basic plot became the subject of
                many comical spoof-parodies including  <i>Monty
                Python and the Holy Grail (1975, UK) </i>(the flagellation sequence,
                the witch burning scene, and the mock-Swedish subtitles), Woody
                Allen's <i>Love and Death (1975)</i>, <i>Bill &amp; Ted's
                Bogus Journey (1991)</i> (with its Grim Reaper character and
                Bill &amp; Ted's games with Death), and<i>  Last Action Hero
                (1993)</i>. During the Crusades and its time of medieval war,
                the Black Plague and misery, disillusioned and exhausted 14th
                century Swedish knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) after ten
                years of military service was finally returning home accompanied
                by his cynical squire J&ouml;ns (Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand). On
                their journey, the Knight and Squire made a side visit to a rural
                church, where painter Albertus Pictor (Gunnar Olsson) was drawing
                a series of frescos, including a painting of a fresco of the <i>Danse
                Macabre </i>(a
              dance of Death to the grave). The Knight engaged in a grim dialogue
              with a black-hooded and robed, white-faced Grim-Reaper figure of
              Death (Bengt Ekerot) who threatened his existence. The knight,
              who had mostly lost his faith, bargained with Death - an emissary
              from God - to play an allegorical game of Chess that would determine
              his fate - he would either win (and survive) or lose (and forfeit
              his life). If the game was lost, the Knight would be led away in
              a Dance of Death procession (<i>danse
              macabre</i>). In a continuing stark scene set on a desolate beach,
              a chess game was played between them throughout the film. The Knight
              engaged in a lengthy confessional in the church's chapel to a shrouded
              monk - when he delivered his deepest thoughts about wanting a sign
              from God of his presence, in order to help his belief. During
              the confessional, the Knight divulged his chess strategy to outwit
              Death during the game. But  then
            in a startling revelation, it was shown that the monk was Death himself
            - who responded: &quot;I'll remember that!&quot;; the Knight replied: &quot;You
            are a snake in the grass!&quot; In the meantime,
          the Knight also encountered an itinerant acting troupe performing a
          Passion play. Within the caravan, he met a husband and wife pair named
            Jof (Nils Poppe) (a juggler) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) with their
          infant son Mikael (Tommy Karlsson). Their names resembled the names
          of the Joseph and Mary couple. Jof's simple faith enabled him to envision
            the existence of a human afterlife with a heaven and hell, while
            the Knight's visions were frustrating, elusive and not reassuring
            about a spiritual world after death. The philosophizing and skeptical
            Antonius felt tormented by an unseen God whom he thought was
            mocking him and remained hidden and vague. For him, life was
            meaningless and to be dreaded if there was no hope for life after
            death. However, in moments with Jof and Mia,
            the Knight became hopeful and enjoyed being alive; he
            found brief relief and peace during a fellowship picnic meal scene
            with the couple enjoying natural foods - wild strawberries and a
            bowl of milk. The
            dining sequence functioned as a symbolic, liturgical ceremony of
            the Eucharistic with bread and wine without supernatural overtones.
            Antonius offered the actors safe passage through a forested area
            to his castle. In stark contrast, Antonius's only witnessing of organized
            religion was to observe a procession of flagellants and the burning
            at the stake of a Witch (Maud Hansson) - an insane female accused
            of consorting with the Devil. As the film's chess game drew to a
            close, the Knight knocked the pieces over to buy more time, and to
            allow the young family he had met to outrun Death (the Black Plague).
            Death reset the chess board and stated emphatically:
            &quot;No one escapes me&quot; -  Death would soon visit the Knight
            one last time. In the film's conclusion
            after reuniting with his wife Karin (Inga Landgr&eacute;) and family
            during a final supper sequence, Death arrived to interrupt the Knight.
            He had just affirmed that he had performed a single, final comforting
            and redemptive good-will act (&quot;one meaningful deed&quot;)
            and found some significant meaning in his life. Jof (with another
            paranormal experience) watched as the Knight and his followers-companions
            were led away over the hillside in a wild, solemn and macabre Dance
            of Death. </font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Alexander Mackendrick<br />
          This taut, little-seen, menacing, late film noir classic was the first
          American film of Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick. Filmed on
          location in NYC, it was based on the
            novelette-short story by Ernest Lehman titled <em>Tell Me About It
            Tomorrow<i>,</i></em> with
           a script by Clifford Odets and  Lehman. In the film's opening,
            a large poster was viewed adorning the back of a truck: &quot;GO
            WITH THE GLOBE, READ J.J. HUNSECKER - The Eyes of Broadway.&quot; 
            It was presented with a rectangular logo that displayed the thick,
            horn-rimmed and spectacled eyes of the famous, domineering, power-mongering
            NY columnist J. J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) for the <i>New York
           Globe</i> newspaper. The weasely, opportunistic, aspiring, two-bit,
            vicious and pandering press agent Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) - a
           well-dressed, slimy, glamorous, manipulative pretty-boy Broadway agent,
           was forever struggling to place promotional items into
            Hunsecker's popular syndicated column in the newspaper, titled: 
          &quot;The Eyes of Broadway,&quot; in order to create media exposure
          for his show-biz clients. Falco
              had already failed dismally on his latest personal assignment ordered
              by the unscrupulous and overprotective Hunsecker - to disrupt,
              break up and destroy the romantic relationship between Hunsecker's
          19 year-old younger sister Susan Hunsecker (Susan Harrison) and her
          blonde-haired boyfriend, up-and-coming jazz musician Steve Dallas (Martin
          Milner). Falco's efforts had backfired and the unyielding Hunsecker
          had denied any column space to Sidney's pandering attempts at publicity,
            and had exiled or banished Sidney from his sight. The
            first revealing view of the actual, beetle-browed, thick-spectacled,
            pallor-faced, power-mongering, crew-cutted NY columnist Hunsecker
            was in the &quot;21&quot; Restaurant where he regularly held court.
            Hunsecker delivered a brilliant, but vitriolic and foul description
            of lackey press agent Sidney Falco that ended with the famous line: &quot;Match
            me, Sidney.&quot; In a short scene outside the restaurant when Hunsecker
            and Sidney observed a drunk being thrown out of <i>Club Pigalle</i> into
            the street and kicked, Hunsecker turned and sadistically smiled with
            an exultant grin: &quot;I love this dirty town.&quot;  During a
            memorable night scene, Hunsecker gazed out and towered over the
            skyline from his high-rise penthouse to survey the prone city below
            that he loved, possessed, and dominated like an imperious gargoyle.
             The unethical and immoral Falco, who was desperate to please Hunsecker
            (and knowing that the couple was closer to getting married), developed
            a new and sinister smear - that the bohemian musician
            Steve Dallas was a dope-smoking drug addict (with planted evidence
             of marijuana cigarettes) and a card-carrying Communist. But 
            then, the duplicitous Hunsecker promised Susan, to get in her good
            graces, that he felt compelled to pull
            some strings to get Steve's job back after he was fired from the
            jazz club where his combo played - in order to regain the couple's
            confidence. In a famous line of dialogue, Hunsecker insulted Falco
            for his evil nature: &quot;I'd
            hate to take a bite out of you. You're a cookie full of arsenic.&quot; Steve
            saw through the ploy and blamed Hunsecker for the smear, and bravely
            stood up to Hunsecker's manipulations of his romantic relationship
            with Susan that forbid them to be together. Hunsecker's 
            over-reaching protectiveness toward his sister and insistent demands
            to break up her relationship led him to coerce Falco to hire a fat
            NYPD cop named Lieutenant Harry Kello (Emile Meyer) to brutally beat
            Steve up and falsely arrest him as a pot-smoker. Then, it
            was revealed that Hunsecker maintained a forbidding, secretive life
            as a repressed, asexual bachelor who exhibited unnatural 'incestuous'
            possessiveness for his sister Susan.  Susan blamed Sidney and J.J.
            as  responsible for the subsequent assault and false arrest of her
            boyfriend, and then threatened to commit suicide by hurling herself
            from her high-rise balcony, claiming that J.J. would
             then punish Sidney for allowing her to jump. At
             first, she threatened Falco: &quot;You're
            gonna be the man who drove his beloved little sister to suicide&quot; -
            and though Falco rescued her from suicide, a rigid-faced, menacing
            Hunsecker arrived home at that very moment and misinterpreted
            the situation, thinking that Sidney had attempted rape.  The
            final scene was of Susan's vengeful departure to escape from
            her smothering, obsessed and 'incestuous' brother, and from the
            spineless, fast-talking Falco (both responsible for Steve's hospitalization).
            Before she left, she vilified her brother:
          &quot;I'd rather be dead than living with you. For all the things
            you've done, J.J., I know I should hate you. But I don't. I pity
            you.&quot;  She strode into the early morning
            sunlight at film's end, while a raging
          Hunsecker had Falco beaten up by Lt. Kello. </font></p>        </td>

          <font size="2">Director/writer Nunnally Johnson's film-noirish, B/W
              psychological drama was an authenticated
              representation of an actual psychiatric case recorded in the 1957
              book	<i>The Three Faces of Eve: A Case of Multiple Personality</i> that
              	was  written by two Georgia psychiatrists of the Medical College
              (Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey M. Cleckley) who assisted with the
              screenplay. Before their book's publication, the two doctors had
              also published a research article in 1954 about their therapeutic
              sessions with their multiple-personality patient &quot;Eve.&quot; Best
          Actress-winning Joanne Woodward provided  a <i>tour-de-force</i> performance
          in the role of the actual patient named Chris Costner Sizemore. Facing
          the camera in an empty movie theatre, the distinguished Alistair Cooke
          (as Himself) provided authenticity to the film with his opening narration,
          followed by additional off-screen commentary about the progression
          of the main character's illness: (&quot;This is a true
          story. How often have you seen that statement at the beginning of a
          picture?... Well, <i>this is a true story</i> about a sweet rather
          baffled young housewife, who in 1951, in her hometown in Georgia, suddenly
          frightened her husband by behaving very unlike herself....in a literal
          and terrifying sense, inside this demure young woman, two very vivid
          and different personalities were battling for the mastery of her character.
          She was, in fact, a case of what is called 'multiple personality'&quot;).
          In the film version set in Augusta, GA in August of 1951,  a young,
          drab, withdrawn, plagued young housewife named Eve White (Joanne Woodward)
          was introduced. Eve's concerned husband Ralph White (David Wayne) became
          disturbed by his wife's aberrant behavior (i.e., buying flashy clothes)
          and physical symptoms (blinding headaches, memory lapses or amnesia,
          and blackouts) and  reported the distressing symptoms to Dr. Curtis
          Luther (Lee J. Cobb). Eve apparently attempted to strangle
          the White's young daughter Bonnie (Terry Ann Ross) with a venetian-blind's
          cord in their living room, and Ralph had to throw her to the ground.
          In consultation with Dr. Luther, Eve claimed she was hearing one familiar
          but unrecognizable female voice (&quot;She tells me to do things...To
          do things like leave Ralph, take Bonnie and run away. All kind of terrible
          things like that&quot;). It was a symptom of her underlying mental
          illness. During Dr. Luther's treatment involving psychiatric therapy
          and hypnosis sessions with her, Eve (in addition to her normal timid
          Eve White personality) was found to have an additional or separate
          personality (or face) that emerged -- a fun-loving, flirtatious, seductive,
          party-happy, provocative, wild and immodest character known as Eve
          'Black.' Completely out of character, Eve denied that she was married
          to the &quot;jerk&quot; Ralph,
          and referred to Mrs. White in the third person. Dr. Luther described
          his patient as having a multi-phasic personality disorder. By 1952,
          Eve was admitted to the hospital for treatment, and Dr. Luther confirmed
          his diagnosis of &quot;multiple personality&quot; to both Eve and Ralph.
          After about two weeks, it was decided that Eve could be discharged,
          since she wasn't considered a danger to herself or others. She would
          receive out-patient treatment, while Ralph moved by himself to
          Jacksonville, FL However, Eve's sporadic and unstable behavior, including
          provocative and seductive nightclub behavior with other men (and with
          Ralph himself) increased tensions and forced Ralph to ultimately divorce
          his wife. Dr. Luther was worried that both of Eve's two personalities
          were incapable of being 'normal.' In fact, he learned from Eve 'Black'
          that Mrs. White had considered suicide the night before by slitting
          her wrist with a razor blade. After further hypnosis, a third more
          stable, composed, mature and sophisticated matronly personality emerged
          known as 'Jane.' She claimed that she knew of her alter-egos
          (Eve 'Black' and Mrs. White) but was mostly unfamiliar with them. In
           the fall of 1953 during further treatment, Eve
              &quot;White&quot; (who appeared to be 'dying' or disappearing)
              reported instances of intense fatigue and other memory lapses.
              Eve (under hypnosis) recalled a traumatic event in her own childhood
          (Mimi Gibson as young Eve); during
          the memory, Eve cried out: &quot;No, Mama! Mama, please don't make
          me!...She made me kiss her!&quot;  In a stunning flashback, the young
          girl described how her mother had forced her to kiss her grandmother
          in an open-casket during a funeral: (&quot;You've got to kiss Grandma
          goodbye. Then you won't miss her so much if you kiss her goodbye, sugar
          pie. You know that&quot;). It
          appeared that the terrifying incident was the trigger that had
          given birth to the personality of Eve &quot;White.&quot; The
          recollection of her troubled past helped Eve to purge herself of her
          two negative 'Eve' selves, integrate her memories into one person (&quot;Jane&quot;),
        and cure her of the psychological disorder. In the film's concluding
          sequence set in 1955, two years after her breakthrough, Dr. Luther
          received a letter (in voice-over) from Jane about how she had formed
          a new family with Bonnie and a compassionate, understanding and loving
          man named Earl (Ken Scott), with the definitive statement: &quot;Still
          no more Eve White and no more Eve Black.&quot;</font></p>        </td>

              105 minutes, D: Akira Kurosawa<br />
          Co-writer/director Kurosawa's dramatic samurai film was one of many
           interpretations or adaptations of William Shakespeare's tragedy-play <i>Macbeth</i>,
           now a tale of political treachery and murder set in 16th century feudal
           Japan (a time of dramatic Noh theater) instead of Medieval Scotland.
           This brilliant classic masterpiece, without using a single word of
           the Bard's famous dialogue, followed Orson Welles' <i>Macbeth
          (1948)</i>, and came before Roman Polanski's <i>Macbeth (1971)</i> and
          Joel Coen's <i>The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021)</i>, amongst others. In
          the plot, after victory in battle, Japanese general and warrior Taketoki
          Washizu (Toshiro Mifune) returned to the castle of reigning Lord Tsuzuki
          (Takamaru Sasaki) near the foggy and dense Spider's Web Forest. To
          Washizu's surprise, a premonition of his future - delivered by a mysterious
          evil Forest Witch or ghost-spirit in the forest just before his arrival
          at the castle - came true. It was predicted that Washizu would be named
          Lord of the Northern Garrison, and that he would  soon replace
          Tsuzuki as Lord of Spider's Web Castle. Washizu's manipulative and
          ambitious wife Lady Asaji Washizu (Isuzu Yamada) spurred on the ascension
          of her husband to the throne by plotting the assassination of Tsuzuki.
          Washizu entered Tsuzuki's bedchamber and killed him in his sleep. The
          ruthless Lady Washizu cast blame on an innocent guard (who was quickly
          slain to assure his silence) to shield her treacherous husband's guilt.
              Washizu's actions were considered suspicious by Lord Tsuzuki's
              vengeful son Kuniharu Tsuzuki (Y&#333;ichi
            Tachikawa), but Washizu's faithful friend, General Yoshiaki Miki
              (Minoru Chiaki), remained uncertain. Miki's son Yoshiteru Miki
              (Akira Kubo) was chosen as Washizu's heir
            because he and Asaji had no child of their own. However, Lady Asaji
            soon after revealed that she was pregnant, necessitating  the beheading
              of General Miki (his head was brought forward in a banquet scene),
              although Miki's son escaped. Problems multiplied for the increasingly
              paranoid Lord Washizu, when opposing forces were allied against
              him, and Lady Asaji's son was stillborn. Upon his return to the
              forest for further otherworldly advice, Lord Washizu was told that
              he wouldn't be defeated in battle until &quot;the
            trees of the Spider's Web Forest rise against the castle&quot; -
            an impossibility in Washizu's corrupted mind. The next day, however,
            his wife was found semi-crazed, in a catatonic trance, guilt-ridden
            and vainly attempting to wipe unseen blood stains from her hands,
            as a soldier reported that the cobweb forest's trees had indeed risen
            up to attack. In the film's conclusion, Lord Washizu made a memorable
            final stand against his own troops. A volley of arrows from his archers
            fired at him and resulted in his death on the throne, when one arrow
            lethally pierced his neck and chest. The approaching army of opposition
            forces revealed that they had cut trees in the forest during the
            night to create the illusion of their uprising.</font></p>

          Twelve Angry Men), </b>96 minutes, D: Sidney Lumet<br />
           Sidney Lumet's debut directorial film, a taut courtroom drama, was based on
          Reginald Rose's television play. In a hot summer courtroom in NYC after
          the trial, instructions by a Judge (Rudy Bond) were given to the jury,
          concerning the case of an 18 year-old, slum-dwelling Puerto Rican/Latino
          defendant (John Savoca), held on charges of murdering his abusive,
          ex-con father with a switchblade knife - he faced the electric chair
          if convicted. He had been defended by a poorly-paid, inept public defender.
          The entire film consisted of the deliberations of twelve male individuals
          (each un-named but with a number) held in a swelteringly-hot, bare-walled
              claustrophobic jury room, punctuated by flashbacks about the case
              and trial, to decide the fate of the minority defendant. They had
              been given instructions from the judge about 'innocent until proven
            guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' One female
            witness testified that through her bedroom window and a passing elevated
            train, she had seen the murder. Another elderly witness claimed he
            heard the defendant say: &quot;I'll kill you&quot; - after which
            he heard the body drop and saw the defendant running down the stairs.
            As evidence, the long switchblade murder weapon was similar to the
            one the defendant had purchased. On the witness stand, the defendant's
            alibi was weak - he said he was at the movies during the night before
            returning to the scene of the crime, but couldn't recall the movies
            that he had seen. The case required a unanimous vote (&quot;beyond
            a reasonable doubt&quot;) of 12 jurors to convict, and to send the
            defendant with a mandatory death sentence to the electric chair.
            It was a seemingly open-and-shut case. After
            the first rapid jury vote, it was eleven to one for conviction. Juror
            # 8 (Henry Fonda), an architect, was the sole doubting and dissenting
            vote. The tempers, prejudices and personalities
              of the cranky, smoking men were displayed as they examined the
          evidence and deliberated their verdict. After
          considerable deliberations and discussion, including # 8's display
          of an identical switchblade knife he had bought, a second vote was
          taken - # 8 was joined by Juror # 9 (Joseph Sweeney) - and now it was
          ten to 2. Juror # 8 began to poke holes in the flimsy evidence, the
          inconsistent testimony of the unreliable witnesses, and the prejudices
          of some of the other jurors, especially Juror # 10 (Ed Begley). For
          one thing, the old male witness probably couldn't have heard the defendant
            yell at his father as the noisy six-car train passed on the tracks.
            And the elderly man, who was lame, couldn't have walked from his
            bedroom to his door in 15 seconds as he claimed. The woman who
            said she saw the crime through the passing train was not wearing
            her glasses. Eventually, revotes dwindled down the number of those
            calling for conviction. Only one Juror, # 3 (Lee J. Cobb) remained
            defiant, and he too changed his vote. The defendant was acquitted
          of the crime. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b>Wild Strawberries (1957, Swed.) (aka Smultronst&auml;llet)</b>,
              91 minutes, D: Ingmar Bergman<br />
              Ingmar Bergman's allegorical, deeply-emotional road film was about
              an elderly man's look back at his past, told through a flashback
              structure. The film was literally titled &quot;the wild strawberry
              patch&quot; referring to the wild, unburdened and free strawberries
              growing and simply existing in a hidden and secret place in one's
        past that could be revisited, hopefully without regret or pain. At his
              desk, Professor Isak Borg (legendary silent film actor and Scandinavian
              director Victor Sjostrom), a 78 year-old widowed, grumpy, wealthy,
              retired medical professor and doctor described
        his isolated and lonely life (in voice-over). Early the next morning,
              Isak experienced an expressionistic nightmarish dream sequence
              (also in voice-over) on a deserted, white-walled city street in
        Stockholm - with images of death. On the empty streets, he saw a clock
              without hands, a collapsing faceless figure, and his own corpse
              in a spilled coffin.  The lonely, melancholic professor
            reassessed his heartless, constrained and cold life during the film's
            375-mile car road trip from Stockholm to his former university in
            Lund. There at 5:00 pm, he was to receive an honorary
            degree (&quot;Jubilee Doctor&quot;) in the University's Cathedral
        50 years after he had earned his doctor's degree. His visiting, pregnant
            daughter-in-law Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), unhappily estranged but
            married to his sole son - middle-aged physician Evald (Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand)
        who lived in Lund, impulsively asked to join him. During the journey,
            she explained her and her husband's reasons for disliking Isak -
            their frustration with him was partially due to the fact that he
            was &quot;filthy rich&quot; and
          didn't need money and still demanded payback of their loan. She also
        mentioned his selfish, ruthless, egotistical and uncaring nature. In
            a series of episodic sequences, he revisited (both in his flashbacked
            imagination and literally) many of the landmarks of his past. Their
            first stop was his family's summer home where he lived for the first
            20 years of his life with nine other siblings. This was the location
        of the titled wild strawberry patch. He jealously recollected watching
            his onetime, long-departed sweetheart cousin Sara (Bibi Andersson)
            with Isak's own irresponsible, misbehaving, 
        &quot;good-for-nothing&quot; brother Sigfrid (Per Sj&ouml;strand). He
          was reminded that she had broken his heart when she later married Sigfrid
        and had 6 children.  Three
            young hitchhikers joined them - two young men Viktor
        (Bj&ouml;rn Bjelfvenstam) and Anders (Folke Sundquist), and Sara (also
        played by Bibi Andersson). Both Sara characters were caught between two
        lovers who were competing for her affection. Enroute after a brief lunch,
        Marianne and Isak stopped at the home of Isak's elderly, 96 year-old
        cold-hearted mother Mrs. Borg (Naima Wifstrand). Isak was her sole surviving
        son of ten children. She showed Isak a box of keepsake mementos, including
        an old discarded doll, toys and her husband's gold pocket watch with
        no hands (the same one seen in his opening dream sequence). She provided
        hints into why people perceived her son as similarly-cold; she even openly
        admitted: &quot;I have felt cold all my life.&quot; During the remainder
        of the trip, Isak napped and dreamt of being with Sara in the strawberry
        patch once again. While napping, Isak was also forced to face his
              past and remember that his deceased wife Karin (Gertrud Fridh)
        was very unhappy in their marriage and despised him. He listened as she
        blamed their problems on Isak's &quot;cold as ice&quot; callous and passive
        detachment from her and life. Also, while sitting in the car with Isak,
        Marianne explained to him the reason for her disintegrating marriage
        to his melancholy and sad 38 year-old son Evald. When she had told
          Evald that she was pregnant, he said 
        that he didn't want the child.  Marianne was worried about Isak's emotional
        detachment, with fears for her own pregnancy and future life with her
        husband Evald. Nonetheless, she vowed to Isak that she would
        have the child. In the film's satisfying,
          well-deserved and peaceful conclusion with some elements of hope and
          redemption, after Isak was awarded a degree at the ceremony, he appeared
          to come closer to his daughter-in-law Marianne and her husband Evald.
          He suggested cancelling Evald's long-standing enormous debt to him,
        and helped to bring them together and reconcile their marriage. Furthermore,
          Isak experienced one more childhood dream to calm him. His memories
            would no longer torment him, but provided moments of pleasant nostalgia.
        His last uplifting dream was of a family picnic by a lake at his summer
        home. Sara ran up to him and told him: &quot;There are no
        wild strawberries left.&quot; </font></p></td>

                  For The Prosecution (1957)</a>, </b>114 minutes,
              D: Billy Wilder<br />
          Co-writer and director Billy Wilder's brilliant film
              had crisp dialogue, a complicated and intriguing plot, unique characters
              and excellent acting performances. 
              It was a convoluted, twisting courtroom drama-mystery adapted from
               Agatha Christie's classic  four-character short story &quot;Traitor's
               Hands,&quot; first printed in 1925 in the British magazine <i>Flynn's, </i>and
               then published in the 1930s and 1940s in both the UK and US as &quot;The
               Witness for the Prosecution.&quot; It then became a celebrated
               1953 stage play and murder mystery (in London and on Broadway).
               The film told about an aging, distinguished, near-retirement age
               London barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton), with
               his overbearing housekeeper/nurse Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester,
               Laughton's real-life wife) tending to his near-failing health
               for a weak heart. The intelligently clever and incorrigible attorney
               was asked by solicitor Mr. Mayhew (Henry Daniell) to take on a
               perplexing case, the defense of the prime suspect - an unemployed,
               American expatriate inventor named Leonard Stephen Vole (Tyrone
               Power in his final film role). He was charged with the murder
               of wealthy widow Emily Jane French (Norma Varden), in order to
               inherit her property (80,000 pounds). The testimony -- and true
               identity -- of the mysterious, beautiful German-born 'wife' of
               the accused, Christine &quot;Helm&quot; Vole (Marlene Dietrich),
          held the key to solving the case involving marital infidelities and
          deceit. She was her husband's only alibi - but she could not, as the
          defendant's wife, be considered a credible witness. However, she WAS
          called as a 'witness for the prosecution' to damningly testify against
              him and cold-heartedly betray her husband. On
              the stand, she admitted that: (1) she wasn't really legally married
              to Leonard (and could therefore testify against him), (2) she was
              forced by him to provide a false alibi, and (3) her husband had
              admitted the murder to her, after returning home with blood on
              his clothes. When a mysterious Cockney woman (also Dietrich) called
              Sir Wilfrid claiming that she had surprise information to help
              his client, the film set up the twist ending. She offered to supply
              the barrister with love letters that the perjuring Christine had
              written to a mysterious lover named Max. When the trial resumed,
              Sir Wilfrid confronted Christine with the letters (so she could
              get rid of Leonard and be with another man) to prove that she had
              lied. Having proven Christine to be a liar and unreliable witness,
              Leonard was declared 'not guilty.' After
              Leonard had been acquitted, Christine revealed that she was disguised
              as the Cockney woman who had devised the ploy of love letters to
              get Vole acquitted. Only by being an entirely uncredible witness
              could she get her husband declared innocent. The defendant had
              obviously been guilty all along, and had committed the crime. He
              also declared that he was unfaithful and philandering with Diana
              (Ruta Lee), who arrived in the courtroom to run away with him.
              Then, with furious and jealous anger, Christine shockingly stabbed
              him to death for his double-crossing philandering! This climactic
              murder was followed by Sir Wilfrid's classic line when he corrected
              his nurse Miss Plimsoll about the killing: &quot;Killed him? She
              executed him.&quot; Sir Wilfrid would now serve as Christine's
          defense lawyer. </font></p>          </td>
