          <p><font size="2"><b>Funny Girl (1968), </b>151 minutes, D: William
              Wyler<br />
              Director William Wyler's highly-fictionalized musical biography
              was about the famed, early 20th century Ziegfeld Follies revue
          performer Fanny Brice, who  was both a comedienne and film star. It 
          was Wyler's first musical film - a Columbia Pictures adaptation of
          the Jule Style-Isobel Lennart-Bob Merrill stage musical that starred
          singer Barbra Streisand (reprising her 1964 Broadway role). The
          sequel <i>Funny Lady (1975)</i> provided more about Fanny Brice's life
          and also starred Barbra Streisand. In the  film's opening,  film
          star/comedian Fanny Brice (Best Actress-winning Barbra Streisand) entered
           the New Amsterdam Theatre, where theatrical producer Florenz Ziegfeld,
          Jr. (Walter Pidgeon) and his &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; show was
          being featured. She entered the empty auditorium and sat in the third
          row, where she was informed that the show's producer Flo Ziegfeld was
          patiently waiting for her in his office. This line cued the film's
          major flashback to Fanny's youth and humble beginnings, beginning at
          her mother's Brice's Saloon. In the film's  flashback, the aspiring
          and gifted rags-to-riches performer Fanny
              Brice was initially introduced as an unglamorous, gawky and uncoordinated
              Jewish girl from the Lower East Side of NY, putting her at a disadvantage
          with her competition.  She was determined to
          convince others that she was going to be the next big star. She failed
          during a chorus audition in vaudeville, admitting that she had mistakenly
          tried out for a mismatching chorus role, although she was more &quot;a
          singer and a comic.&quot; She was given
          a second chance to perform in a novelty act after falsely claiming
          that she could roller-skate. She humorously and clumsily participated
          in (and sabotaged) the stage number with other skating chorus girls;
          however, her act was interpreted as deliberate, comedic and hilarious.
          Backstage afterwards, she drew the attention of handsome, charismatic
          and seductive ladies' man suitor Nicky Arnstein (Omar
          Sharif), her future husband. Six months later, she received a personal
          telegram from Flo Ziegfeld himself to audition at the New Amsterdam,
          with Ziegfeld in the audience. She sang: &quot;Second Hand Rose&quot; for
          her audition song  and was promptly
          hired as a Ziegfeld Girl. Feeling 'unbeautiful,' she challenged Ziegfeld
          about singing a second song  &quot;His Love Makes Me Beautiful&quot; in
          the show, but accepted Ziegfeld's orders to avoid being rejected entirely. At
          her opening night performance in Ziegfeld's &quot;Follies,&quot; she unexpectedly transformed
          the dramatic, lavish wedding-song finale  
          song into a brilliant comedic performance by appearing on-stage
          as a pregnant bride (&quot;in the family way&quot;) with a pillow stuffed
          under her wedding gown. The audience broke into laughter and Ziegfeld
              was outraged, but ultimately her
              decision to abruptly change the mood of the song with a comic twist
              brought her lasting attention and fame. The handsome Nick again
           appeared  at Fanny's dressing room door, and offered her praises
              with a dozen yellow roses and a card, and accompanied her to her
              mother's block party at Brice's Saloon. To find privacy, they entered
              the alleyway where Fanny sang: &quot;People&quot; - a song of emotional longing.
              Afterwards, Nick mentioned that he wanted to get to know her more,
          but couldn't promise when he would see her again. In the meantime,
          Fanny became the show's biggest star. A little over a year since their
              previous visit, Nick met her on tour at the Baltimore train station
              and invited her to a private dinner at her hotel, the Majestic,
              to wine and dine her. He made direct advances toward her - the
              lights were lowered and they passionately kissed as they reclined
              back on a red chaise-lounger. Nick's next financial venture was
          to sail to Europe and gamble in poker games to win back  money
          lost in his horse-racing business. After he vowed that things were
          different and that he loved her, she impulsively pursued him to the
          New York harbor (with the song &quot;Don't Rain on My Parade&quot;),
          boarded a tugboat, and caught up to his already departed ship. After
          an onboard winning streak that brought in a fortune, Nick proposed
          marriage. The couple moved into a huge, luxurious Long Island mansion
          in the country after millionaire Nick won the Epsom Derby, and began
          to raise a daughter. Fanny was rehired by the Ziegfeld Follies and
          was busily rehearsing for a new show, while Nick was often away from
          home, engaged in numerous failing business ventures. They had to resort to selling
               their home and moving into an apartment in the city. On Fanny's
               opening night of the new show, Nick was attempting to recoup his
               recurrent losses in an all-night poker game at a gambling casino,
               and failed to attend. Fanny became  concerned about his gambling
               addiction and his continual uncaring and irresponsible behavior.
               To redeem and extract himself from his dire financial circumstances,
               the desperate Nick became tempted by another potentially-lucrative
               business venture - to engage in a shady bonds scam, but he initially
               refused. He was then offered to be a partner in the development
               of a second gambling casino on the East Side, but when he learned
               that Fanny had secretly invested $50,000 in the venture, he backed
               out. He became very uncomfortable about how he was becoming more
               and more dependent on her fame and fortune. Instead, Nick turned
               to the shady bonds deal that he had previously rejected, and was
               soon arrested and jailed for embezzlement. Against his lawyer's
               wishes, Nick pled guilty and received a 2 year-sentence (and would
               serve 18 months). He briefly spoke to Fanny and bluntly stated: &quot;I
               want you to divorce me,&quot; but she convinced him to postpone his
               decision about their divorce until after he was released from
               jail. After their tearful goodbye, Fanny sang &quot;Funny Girl&quot; -
               his moniker for her. In the film's conclusion - an end to the
               flashback and a return to the opening scene, Fanny was still reminiscing
               about everything in the third row of the theatre, and awaiting
               Nick's arrival. Once Nick appeared, during their bittersweet reunion
               in her dressing room (like so many other times before), they realized
               that even though they loved each other, they also knew that they
               were only bringing each other unhappiness. Fanny admitted that
               Nick was &quot;right&quot; in asking for a divorce. 
			   The couple decided to part ways with the
               film's final lines: Nick: &quot;Goodbye, Fanny&quot; (long pause) 
			   Fanny: &quot;Bye, Nick.&quot; The film's ending
          song was &quot;My Man&quot; - sung on-stage by Fanny before a black backdrop.</font></p>          </td>

              D: Anthony Harvey<br />
            Director Anthony Harvey's historical, dramatic tale of dysfunctional
            family intrigue was set in the court of British King Henry II (Peter
            O'Toole) in 1183. It was filmed using James Goldman's sharply written
            screenplay (adapted from his own play). The
            film shone with the performances and dialogue between the two leads:
            36-year old O'Toole as the 50 year-old monarch, and 61 year-old Hepburn
            as his younger wife. As the film opened, it had been ten
            years since King Henry II had imprisoned his wife, Queen Eleanor
            of Aquitaine (Katharine Hepburn, who won her third of four acting
            Oscars). She was being punished for helping to precipitate
            a civil war against him. His three treacherous sons were also vying
            for the British throne, including the eldest: a legendary
            and fiery Prince Richard the Lionhearted (Anthony Hopkins in his
            film debut), the quiet but dangerous middle son Prince Geoffrey (John
            Castle), and the youngest - a manipulative and thieving scoundrel
            Prince John (Nigel Terry). The three sons and estranged wife Eleanor
            were summoned by Henry to the castle for a Christmas family reunion
            in Chinon, France. He had decided to name one of his three sons as
            his heir to the throne. Adding to the intrigue and plotting about
            who would be favored (Henry favored John, while Eleanor favored Richard),
            the teenaged but cunning monarch King Philip II of France (Timothy
            Dalton in his film debut) was also invited, with his older sister
            Princess Alais (Jane Merrow) - Henry's mistress. </font></p>          </td>

                  Dead (1968)</a>,</b> 90 minutes, D: George Romero<br />
            Director George Romero's ultra-low budget debut film became one of
            the most important and influential horror films of all time for its
            re-invention of  the genre - it was shot in grainy black-and-white
            with an unknown cast, and was a simple yet brutally relentless plot
            of claustrophobic horror. The film was actually improved by its
            crude   &quot;drawbacks,&quot; since
            they lent a documentary feel and reality that made the film all the
            more horrific. The screenplay was taken from an unpublished short
            story Romero had written called <em>Anubis</em>, so-named after the
          Egyptian god of the dead. While initially considered drive-in
            schlock, the film gained in popularity and critical respect, and
            raised Romero to great heights as a horror filmmaker. He would go
            on to make a zombie trilogy with the successful <em><a href="series-dead2.html">Dawn
            of the Dead (1978)</a> </em>and the lesser <em><a href="series-dead3.html">Day
            of the Dead (1985)</a></em> - and more afterwards. The images of
            the film were haunting, beginning in the opening scene in a remote
            and deserted W. Pennsylvania cemetery, where flighty female lead
            Barbra (Judith O'Dea) was bickering with and being teased by her
            brother Johnny (Russell Streiner in an uncredited role): &quot;They're
            coming to get you, Barbra!&quot; The two were  suddenly attacked
          by one of the 'living dead' (one of many re-animated corpses), who
          had mysteriously risen from the grave for no known reason (though there were vague references
           and speculation about radiation emanating
          from a fallen Venus space probe that exploded in the Earth's atmosphere). A  group
          of seven strangers were brought together as they took refuge from the
          shuffling, hungry, flesh-eating zombies in an isolated  
          farmhouse. A capable, smart and sympathetic black
          man named Ben (Duane Jones) assumed leadership as the army of ravenous
          corpses repeatedly attempted to enter the house during a terrifying
          siege, amidst both unspoken racial and generational tensions between
          him and less capable, older white family man Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman),
          with his wife Helen (Marilyn Eastman) and daughter Karen (Kyra Schon).
          Two others were Tom (Keith Wayne) with his girlfriend Judy (Judith
          Ridley). Meanwhile, news and radio reports from the mass media emphasized the panic and
          threat. Attempts to escape failed as one-by-one, the members of the
          besieged group were picked off by the menacing ghouls who surrounded and then broke
          into the house. At one point in the film, after Harry was shot dead
          during a confrontation with Ben, the zombified young Karen consumed
          part of Harry's corpse, and then murdered her mother by repeated stabs
          with  a cement trowel (often taken to be a social metaphor for the
          late 1960s youth of the nation rebelling against their elders). Sole
          surviving Ben was forced to shoot and kill both a reanimated Harry
          and Helen. In the dawn of a new day in the film's tragic ending, a
          lynch-mob posse of armed men led by  bigoted Sheriff  
          McClelland (George Kosana) approached the house - and tragically shot
          and killed Ben, and then threw his corpse on a fiery funeral pyre of
          burning zombie bodies.</font></p>        </td>

            This was director Leone's  true western epic masterpiece
                - a revisionistic revenge western filmed in John Ford's favored
                location, Monument Valley, and in Spain. It featured a great
                musical score (and harmonica melody) by Ennio Morricone, and
                told about the coming of the railroad and the struggle between
                various groups for monopolistic control - with numerous instances
                of homage to earlier traditional Hollywood westerns. And it also
                brought together all the themes, characterizations,
            and experimental visuals from his own previous three
                films - the successful &quot;spaghetti western&quot; trio of
                films from 1964 to 1966 starring Clint Eastwood as &quot;The
                Man With No Name.&quot; Its widescreen opening sequence has been justly celebrated - a tense,
              detailed, almost-wordless standoff at noon in the midday sun between
              three hired gunmen (Snaky (Jack Elam), Stony (Woody Strode), and Knuckles (Al Mulock)) at
              a train station, marked by only exaggerated sound effects, wide
              closeups, and the arrival of the train with a harmonica-playing
              killer named &quot;Harmonica&quot; (Charles
              Bronson). The plot was about a beautiful widow,
              reformed ex-New Orleans prostitute Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale),
              who arrived at her Sweetwater homestead in the desert - a key location
              where trains crossing the continent would have to stop for water.
              Just before her arrival, her new husband, local Irish businessman
              Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) and his three children had just
            been massacred (due to a railroad dispute) - it was a cold-blooded
            and merciless ambush and murder led by blue-eyed, black-hatted, 
            railroad company employee Frank (American icon-actor Henry Fonda
            in an about-face role as a villainous, sadistic murderer). Frank
            was taking orders from  sickly, crippled and corrupt railroad tycoon
            Morton, aka &quot;Mr. Choo Choo&quot; (Gabriele Ferzetti). The
            McBain murders were set up to blame honorable yet grizzled escaped con and half-breed,
            wily scoundrel Cheyenne (Jason Robards). Jill
            received help from the mysterious harmonica-playing stranger  and
            protector/escaped con Cheyenne after the brutal killings, to thwart
            efforts of others to take her inherited strategic plot of land. The
            film concluded with a  classic confrontational ending - a showdown
            duel between Harmonica and Frank, that revealed (in a fateful, revelatory
            flashback) the reason for Harmonica's life-long search for revenge
            against Frank. In the final sequence, a mortally-wounded Cheyenne
            (earlier he had been shot in the abdomen during Cheyenne's rescue) 
			spoke his final words to Harmonica, who
            then rode away (with a second horse carrying the slumped-over corpse of Cheyenne). Meanwhile, Jill
            confidently strode to the Sweetwater railway station to offer water
            to the laborers and track-laying crews before the end credits began
            to roll. </font></p>          </td>

          <p><font size="2"><b><a href="planetofapes.html">Planet of the Apes (1968)</a>, 
		  </b>112 minutes, D: Franklin Schaffner<br />
            Director Franklin Schaffner's  thought-provoking, engaging and engrossing
            science-fiction film classic and action-thriller was a loose adaptation
            (by formerly blacklisted Michael Wilson and Rod Serling) of the Pierre
            Boulle novel <em>La Plan&egrave;te
          Des Singes (Monkey Planet).</em> This Vietnam
          War, Cold War and Civil Rights era film made many subtle points about
          race, animal rights, the establishment, class, xenophobia and discrimination.
          It was a pioneer in modern movie marketing, spawning not only <a href="series-planetofapes2.html">four
          sequels and a 2001 remake</a> and two reboots (and two television series
          spinoffs), but also action figures and other similar merchandising,
          foreshadowing later merchandising for <em><a href="starw.html">Star
          Wars (1977)</a></em> and the <em><a href="series-indianajones.html">Indiana
          Jones</a></em> series. In the film's opening, a US spacecraft (with
          four NASA astronauts) launched in 1972, after a long flight of 18
                months, crash-landed into a lake (and sank) on a strange, Earth-like,
                desolate planet on November 25, 3978, over two millennia after
                take-off. The astronauts had traveled for centuries in cyrogenic
                suspension and had aged by only 20 months. Only three had survived
                the journey: Col. 'George' Taylor (Charlton Heston), Landon (Robert
            Gunner), and Dodge (Jeff Burton). [They didn't know that they had
          landed in an area later known as The Forbidden Zone.] Stranded
            American astronaut Taylor found himself with the other two astronauts
            and other primitive humans being pursued in a cornfield by horse-back
          riding, armed and uniformed gorillas. Taylor was shot in the throat
          (damaging his throat's voice-box), Dodge was killed (and later placed
          as a display in a museum), and Landon was knocked unconscious and captured
            (and later subjected to a lobotomy). Once taken as a prisoner, Taylor
            shockingly realized that the imprisoned and rounded-up caged humans
             were mute and inarticulate and could only grunt. He
            was paired up with a pretty captive, mute female primitive - soon
            after, he named her Nova (Linda Harrison).  The ape society appeared
            to be dominated by English-speaking simians who lived in a multi-layered
            civilization. Humans (who possessed few rights) had been reduced
            to primitive, subservient mute slaves and were even hunted as animals.
          The three layers of society included gorillas (enforcers, hunters and
          laborers), orangutans (gov't leaders, lawyers and religious figures),
          and chimpanzees (scientists and doctors). At the bottom were humans,
          considered feral animals (for experimentation and
            slave labor). Taylor failed in his own attempt to escape when he
              found that he couldn't speak and explain himself to 'animal psychologist'
              Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) (with her fiancee - archaeologist
            Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall)) and malevolent, arrogant, government
            orangutan leader Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans). Dr. Zira and Dr. Cornelius
            were intrigued that Taylor (now nicknamed &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; appeared
            to be a very intelligent, rational human who could speak (after his
            throat healed), read and write, and was possibly an evolved
            &quot;missing link&quot; -  they intended to mate him with Nova.
            During Taylor's attempted escape in Ape City, he discovered a museum
            display or exhibit of a fellow astronaut - Dodge, now a stuffed and
            eyeless corpse. When he was finally caught in a net in the marketplace,
            Taylor delivered snarling and defiant insults toward the ruling apes
             when he feared he would be
              castrated or lobotomized. He spoke for the first time: (&quot;Take
              your stinkin' paws off me, you damn dirty ape!&quot;). He also
              cried out when restrained and sprayed with a high-powered hose:
            (&quot;It's a madhouse!&quot;). In a tribunal
            hearing in the National Ministry assembly hall to rule and decide
            on Taylor's fate, three orangutans assumed a &quot;See
                No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil&quot; pose - imitating the
                wise monkeys of Japanese culture. Although Dr. Zira and Dr. Cornelius
                tried to defend Taylor, their theory that Taylor came from a
                civilization predating the apes that lived in the Forbidden Zone
                was denounced as heresy. As  Taylor was
                aided in his rescue and flight from Ape City, by taking a
                journey to the Forbidden Zone where human artifacts had been
                dug up by Dr. Cornelius, Taylor offered an incredulous goodbye-kiss
                to sympathetic chimpanzee Dr. Zira. When confronted by gorilla
                soldiers in an ape militia led by Dr. Zaius, the chief-of-state
                orangutan confirmed that there had been a cover-up for the masses
                about an ancient human civilization - the truth was that savage,
                murderous, war-like Earth dwellers had destroyed the planet,
                and he was fearful of the humans' need to destroy each other.
                In the startling, twist-surprise ending, as Taylor left the group
                to explore further into the out-of-bounds Forbidden Zone with
                Nova, he rode down a beach on horseback when he suddenly stopped,
                dismounted, and stared upwards. As the
                camera panned toward Taylor, through a spiked object, he had
                two major reactions. He first exclaimed: &quot;Oh,
                my God! I'm back, I'm home. All the time, it was...&quot;,  but
                then he sank and dropped to his knees: &quot;We finally <em>really</em> did
                it.&quot; He pounded his fist into the sand and railed against
                Earth's generations almost 2,000 years earlier that had destroyed
                his home planet's civilization with a devastating nuclear war
                - as Dr. Zaius had speculated - he uttered the film's final line
                of dialogue: &quot;You maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you!
                Goddamn you all to hell!&quot; In  a
            final shocking revelation, the full object came into view as the
            camera panned backward - it was the spiked crown of a battered Statue
            of Liberty that was buried waist-deep in beach sand, signifying that
            Taylor was still on Earth!</font></p>        </td>

            Director Mel Brooks' debut film was a zany, often brilliant spoof
                comedy about Broadway productions and the Nazis that many considered
                in bad taste. Although certain elements are now tame and have
                lost some comedic shock value since the late 60s,  the film was
                still daring, audacious and subversive.  (The studio would
                never have released Brooks' film without the intervention of
                Peter Sellers, who convinced executive producer Joseph E. Levine
                to release it - the only compromise being a change from the original
        title <em>Springtime For Hitler</em> to <em>The Producers.</em>) In 
        the high-energy, opening credits sequence, cash-hungry, desperate, bankrupt,
        wild-eyed, hustling has-been Broadway producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel)
        was entertaining and romancing rich, love-starved little old ladies for
        their money. Max's timid, meek, high-strung and
        neurotic accountant Leopold &quot;Leo&quot; Bloom (Gene Wilder in his
        first starring role) arrived, and Max delivered a &quot;rhetorical conversation&quot; about
          his failed professional life. He also devised a rascally scheme or
        plan, after an off-handed suggestion by Leo who was musing about using
        'creative accounting' techniques. The two greedily paired up and concocted
        an illegal 'sure-fire' scheme to make  millions from investors
        by producing the worst, most tasteless play ever made. They would purposely
        over-finance a &quot;sure-fire flop&quot; play, and then pocket the remainder
        of the investors' money after the show closed. Max fantasized that afterwards,
        they would run away with the stolen money to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
        They met up with with insane, goose-stepping, deranged ex-Nazi &quot;kraut,&quot; WWII
              helmet-wearing Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), a playwright who
              sang German anthems. He was the author of the play <i>Springtime
          For Hitler</i> - that Max wanted to produce on Broadway. They held
          extensive auditions for the chief role of Hitler and chose deranged,
          middle-aged, spaced-out, flower-child actor Lorenzo St. Du Bois &quot;L.S.D.&quot;  (Dick
          Shawn) to play the lead role. Their outrageous, perverted, outlandish
              and distasteful musical at the Playhouse Theatre premiered - with
              the opening, satirical title number <i>Springtime for Hitler</i>,
              complete with a goose-stepping, black-booted Nazi chorus (a parody
              of the Busby Berkeley style in a revolving swastika formation shot
              from overhead). [Note: The lighthearted satire
              of Hitler, reminiscent of Chaplin's <em><a href="greatdictator.html">The
              Great Dictator (1940)</a></em>, with such lyrics as &quot;Don't
              be stupid, be a smarty -- come and join the Nazi Party!&quot; was
              slightly scandalous.] Unexpectedly, their plan backfired - their
              resultant joy was turned to consternation when Leo and Max realized
              that their flop was actually a big surprise hit. After the trio
              conspired to blow up the theatre to end their production of <i>Springtime
              For Hitler</i>, they were charged with fraud and appeared in court.
              Leo presented a lengthy defense of Max to the court, but they were
              proclaimed &quot;incredibly guilty.&quot; The trio was sent to
              the State Penitentiary after being sentenced for 2-5 years - but
              they hadn't learned their lesson. Leo and Max put on a similarly
              fraudulent production of <i>Prisoners
              of Love</i> in prison. Leo was accepting payments for 'shares'
          of the show from other convicts (and even from the warden).</font></p>        </td>

              minutes, D: Franco Zeffirelli<br />
            Director Franco Zeffirelli's  classic and immortal Shakespearean
            tale of forbidden, tragic, and star-crossed love was adapted into
             this modern and realistic version for the first time with
            two teenaged leads. It was shot in  gorgeous Technicolor on location
            in Italy and enhanced by a memorable soundtrack from Nino Rota.The
            film's prologue (a voice-over by narrator Laurence Olivier, uncredited)
            - told about the ongoing, bloody feud between two important families
            in Renaissance Verona and the poignant premonition that &quot;star-crossed
            lovers&quot; - two youthful, innocent, strong-willed lovers [Romeo
             (Leonard Whiting) - son of the Montague family, and Juliet (Olivia
            Hussey) - daughter of the Capulet family] would be doomed by their tender romance and
            die by the tragedy's end, finally bringing about the reconciliation
            of the two bitter, warring families. An opening sword-fighting street
            brawl in the city of Verona occurred between representatives of the
            families of the Montagues and the Capulets - Tybalt (Michael York),
            Lady Capulet's fiery nephew (and Juliet's cousin) on one side, and
            Benvolio (Bruce Robinson), nephew to Montague on the other. The forbidden
            feud was broken up by the arrival of The Prince (Robert Stephens) on horseback
            with a fanfare of trumpets; he announced that the penalty for further
            fights and violations of the peace would be death. On the day of
            the Capulet's evening ball, Romeo and some of his
            friends were planning to crash the festivities wearing disguises.
            As they strolled along, Mercutio (John McEnery), a friend of the
            Prince's, delivered a fanciful, imaginative Queen Mab speech.  At
            the ball, Romeo was immediately startled, entranced, and smitten
            by the lady Juliet.  Romeo circled
            around the perimeter of the crowd during the song, took Juliet's
            hand from behind a pillar, and  spoke his first words to her about
            his passion - she responded equally as they sensually
            pressed their hands together in the famous scene. They also dared
            to kiss each other - as they fell in love. In the secluded Capulet
            garden later that evening, Romeo saw Juliet upon her balcony in
            front of her illuminated windows - he began to utter his famous
            soliloquoy to her. They exchanged a series of loving vows, and made
            plans to marry. They were wed at the altar of the chapel the next
            day, arranged secretly by Romeo's confessor and father figure, Friar
            Laurence (Milo O'Shea), with the assistance of Juliet's bawdy Nurse
            (Pat Heywood). On the afternoon of his marriage, a violent altercation
            arose in the street between Tybalt and Romeo (with his best friend
            Mercutio), leading to Mercutio's accidental death; in retaliation,
            Romeo fought against Tybalt and killed him. 
            The Prince banished the newly-wed Romeo from Verona, forever to
            be exiled and never to return. Before Romeo's flight from Verona
            to the nearby town of Mantua,  the couple were briefly nude on their
            wedding night (the next morning) in Juliet's bedchamber. Afterwards,
            Juliet and Friar Laurence schemed to have Romeo and Juliet meet after
            a daring hoax. Juliet was to assent to an arranged marriage to Paris
            (Roberto Bisacco), but then the day before, she planned to swallow
            a potion that would make her appear in a death-like sleep for 42
            hours. Then, following her burial in the Capulet family tomb, the
            plan was for her to escape with Romeo. Due to bad timing, and Romeo's
            servant Balthasar (Keith Skinner) bringing news to him that Juliet
            was dead (before Romeo was able to be alerted to the Friar's hoax
            by his courier), Romeo rushed back to Juliet's tomb and discovered
            his 'dead' Juliet. In a very dramatic scene, he swallowed
            poison, and kissed her hand before falling beside her. When Juliet
            awoke as planned, she saw Romeo's body on the floor and the poison
            vial in his hand. She picked up Romeo's dagger, stabbed herself in
            the chest, and inevitably joined her love in marriage-death.  The
            final somber and climactic epilogue included the double funeral procession
            of the corpses of the two dead teens, who were carried up church
            steps to be laid in front of the Prince who
            chastised everyone and pronounced judgment on the two feuding families:
            (&quot;All are punished!&quot;). The epilogue's off-screen narration ended
            the film: (&quot;A glooming peace this morning with it brings. The
            sun for sorrow will not show his head, For never was a story of more
            woe, Than this of Juliet and her Romeo&quot;).</font></p>          </td>

              minutes, D: Roman Polanski<br />
               Polish director Roman Polanski's first American feature
              film and his second, scary horror film came after   <i><a href="repulsion1965.html">Repulsion
              (1965, UK)</a></i>, another disturbing film in English,  
               which was also about a mentally-unstable, sexually-terrified
              woman (Catherine Deneuve) who had been left alone in her apartment.
              The script for  the very convincing, creepy,
              psychological, Satanist horror/thriller was
              adapted from Ira Levin's 1967 best-seller. It  effectively made
              the point that evil surrounds us in the alienated, every-day, mundane
              city environment. The story told about a young pregnant wife who
              suspected and had strange premonitions about diabolical forces
            (a witches' coven) threatening her unborn baby, after she was sold
              out in a Faustian deal by her social-striving, aspiring actor-husband.
              A pair of newlyweds moved into a large, rambling, gothic apartment
              building in Central Park West (the Bramford): Guy Woodhouse (John
              Cassavetes), an unemployed, struggling actor, and his frail waifish
              wife Rosemary (22 year old Mia Farrow) with a fertile imagination.
              During dinner, their friend Edward &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchins
              (Maurice Evans) explained some of the morbid and infamous history
              of their apartment building: &quot;The Black Bramford.&quot; They
              met their overly-solicitous and intrusive elderly couple next-door
              neighbors: Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and creepy, nosy Minnie Castevet
              (Oscar-winning Ruth Gordon). Rosemary became &quot;dizzy,&quot; woozy
              and disoriented after eating some tainted chocolate mousse (laced
              with sleeping powder) offered by Minnie. At the start of Rosemary's
              nightmare (reflecting her constant torment and guilt regarding
              her lapsed Catholicism), she wildly hallucinated.
              During her dreamy recollections while lying on the mattress,
              she was surrounded by many chanting, overweight, elderly naked
              figures (of the Satanists' coven), including Guy and the Castevets.
              During her nightmarish  sleepy state, Guy began making love
              to her, but then his appearance changed into a grotesque Beast-like
              figure resembling the Devil, with yellowish eyes and clawed, scaly
              hands. She realized she was being 'raped' during a horrific ritualistic
              copulation scene, as everyone watched her having intercourse with
              the Beast, and she thought to herself: &quot;This is no dream,
              this is really happening.&quot; The next
              morning, Rosemary questioned mysterious scratches she found on
              the side of her body, as Guy admitted making love to her while
              she was passed out.  The  paranoid, haunted, and hysterical 
			  Rosemary began to exhibit signs of experiencing
            a nervous breakdown and a belief in conspiracy theories.  She thought
              she had been impregnated not by her husband but by Satan, so that
              her baby could be used in the New Yorkers' evil cult rituals, with
              coven members including Roman and Minnie. Coincidentally, Guy's
              acting career suddenly turned promising. In her apartment, Rosemary
              was told that her child was born dead by Dr. Sapirstein (Ralph
              Bellamy), who secretly was a member of the witch's coven. She was
              disbelieving and thought her baby had been kidnapped. In the concluding
              sequence of the supernatural horror fest, Rosemary snuck into the
              Castevets' apartment through the closet passageway - with a kitchen
              knife upraised in her hand - where she discovered a coven of witches
              (including Guy), surrounding a black-draped baby cradle-bassinet
              to pay their respects to her Satanic child - the devil's flesh-and-blood
              baby. After Rosemary took her first look and her eyes widened in
              terror and she became completely distraught: (&quot;What
              have you done to its <i>eyes</i>?&quot;),  she then responded
              with nurturing and maternal comfort by  caring for the baby and
              gently rocking Satan's spawn Adrian to sleep.</font></p>        </td>

              <font size="2">This was a strange arthouse sleeper film, much neglected
                and misunderstood when it was first released. The surreal allegorical
                film about a revelatory mid-life crisis-journey was based upon
                John Cheever's 1964 short story &quot;The Swimmer.&quot; On a sunny
                summer afternoon, eccentric, middle-aged advertising executive Ned
                Merrill (Burt Lancaster) impulsively decided to return to his affluent
                home from a pool cocktail party by 'swimming' the distance of 8 miles.
                The fit, virile, self-satisfied and tanned Ned was obsessed with
                the idea of stopping at the homes and pools of friends and neighbors
                of his upper-class, hollow and soulless Connecticut community along
                the way, forming a virtual 'river' (dubbed Lucinda's River after
                his wife) that connected them. Each stop in his journey evoked powerful
                memories, and revealed more about the self-deluded man's past, distorted
                memories and disintegrating life - and his inability to face reality.
                Although nostalgic, he was forced to honestly confront where he was
                in life. Rather than living an ideal existence, he had become a shallow,
                dysfunctional and tortured suburbanite who had failed in his personal
                life. At the Graham's pool, he admitted to an indifferent Betty Graham
                (Kim Hunter) that he once had a secret love for her. Elderly Mrs.
                Hammar (Cornelia Otis Skinner) ordered him off her property. In another
                encounter with nubile 20-year-old ex-babysitter Julie Hooper (Janet
                Landgard) who joined him for part of his swim, he frightened her
                away when she revealed a schoolgirl crush on him and he became inappropriately
                amorous. Others included lonesome and hung-over Joan (Joan Rivers
                in her film debut), a pair of nudists, and stage actress and miffed
                ex-mistress Shirley Abbott (Janice Rule) who assaulted him with the
                truth of their relationship - she never loved him. He was met with
                hostility and criticized by others for his snobby wife and two out-of-control,
                estranged unloving daughters. During his last stop after being completely
                stripped of his protected ego, he arrived during a rainstorm (cold
                and shivering) at his own empty, locked, deserted and abandoned house
                - indicative of his recent financial troubles and the real truth
        about his unraveling broken-down life.</font></p></td>

                  UK)</b></a><b>,</b> 139 minutes, D: Stanley Kubrick<br />
            Director Stanley Kubrick's metaphoric, thought-provoking, grandiose,
            science-fiction landmark film was a visionary, visually dazzling,
            wide-screen masterpiece with mind-blowing special effects. It included
            space travel to Jupiter, the mysterious appearance of four enigmatic
            monoliths, and the presence of the film's major protagonist - an
            omniscient super-computer, all presented in three-acts. The
            first monolith appeared to prehistoric ape-men, awakening them to
            the use of tools as killing weapons. Further monoliths on the Moon
            and floating in space somewhere near Jupiter, seemed to coax humankind
            to make evolutionary leaps and transcend bodily and technological
            limits. A team of robotic-like astronauts Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea)
            and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), during a voyage to Jupiter to
            investigate a radio transmission, were terrorized by the arrogant,
            humanistic, on-board computer HAL 9000 (voice of Douglas Rain). With
            the mission aborted and following a psychedelic light-show, Bowman
            was reborn within an embryonic divine life form that floated in space.</font></p></td>
